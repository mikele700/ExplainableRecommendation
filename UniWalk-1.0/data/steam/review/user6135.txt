Frustrating as hell sometimes, but well worth the purchase.It is very sastifisying to best your opponent with an infinte amount of time to think.Best feature the... the pause button, oh and advanced edition added alot of awesome content too!
Incredibly satisfying and frustrating at the same time.You will quit and restart and throw random things at your computer in rage at your favourite characters death, but its totally worth the amount of satisfaction when everything goes according to plan.P.S. Be aware the bosses.
