This game is set in a dark time with fairy tale civilians. It tells the story of the 'big bad wolf' solving a case that involves murder. It is a thrilling experience to play this game because of how the plot twists, unexpected suspects etc. This game is full of surprises and I as a fan, always wait eagerly for the next episode. 9/10 excellent game.
