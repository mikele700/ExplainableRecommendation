Now you guys may be a bit worried about the term -early Alpha- for this game but it is a very good game for those players who likes managing building city sort of games but i am not here pointing a gun at you to buy it but for all those who dont mind early alpha games like this amazing one (in my opinion) go ahead and suport them for yet anouther brilliant game they have made.Just before i leave it here i also would like to say that this is the very first alpha game i have bought and suposely my first time typeing a review of this game and i very much love it.
