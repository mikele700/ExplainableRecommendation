Dayz is a step up from the mod.it runs off it own engine, which does cause delay because of all the bugs.But every update dayz just gets better. from when dayz first came out to today it looks like its not much, but it seems it is becasue it taken the developers ages just to get to this stage. i hope to see dayz be finished by the end of 2016 and i hope the devs do to. but buy the game because it always fun to see a game develop, as your playing you might find a few bugs some might come handy, others not so muchAll credit to Brian Hicks and his team but hands down probably best zombie game if you put aside the bugs.
