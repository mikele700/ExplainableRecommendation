Selling mods? Really?You know who didn't sell mods? Hitler. Stalin. Mao. None of them sold mods.Looks like I'll be getting my mods from The P1rate B4y. Or just stick with Nexus Mods.
It doesn't work with SLI / CrossfireX, and it also doesn't work if you have a laptop with Multi GPU technology (such as Nvidia Optimus) due to those technologies only working in fullscreen mode. Otherwise, works very well, and is a neat tool.
This is an incredibly versatile game. With lots of gamemodes!Are you creative? Want to build? Play Sandbox. Want to roleplay? Play DarkRP.Want to be a detective, and find murderers? Play Trouble in Terrorist Town. Want to watch YouTube videos with friends? Play Cinema. Want to go on a strange adventure in an elevator? Play Elevator: Source. Want to play Hide and Seek while disguised as a prop? Play Prophunt. Want to play a -Wipeout--esque type of thing? Try Deathrun. That-'s only a few gamemodes - there are 1000s.Seriously, there is nothing Garry-'s Mod can-'t do. Except make me a sandwich. But you can spawn one in.Plus, you can download weapons, vehicles, props, maps, and things other people have made.You can even play with friends and make some crazy contraptions!If you have other Valve made games such as Half Life 2 (and the episodes), Team Fortress 2, Portal (1 and 2), CS:S, CS:GO, DoD:S you can import stuff like items and maps in to Garry-'s Mod! It does this for you.10/10. I can-'t recommend this game enough.
Beautiful soundtrack, intriguing storyline, and complimentary feels.A brilliant visual novel. 10/10.
