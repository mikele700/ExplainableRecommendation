For a game that is 3/4 of the price of the full game, you would expect 3/4 more content. Instead, we got a broken campaign, and although fun, minimal weapons and vehicles. Download mods. Only thing that i can say is good about this is the tanoa map, which is amazing and much better than the first two maps that came with the game.
Jesus, this game has it all.First of all, this is one of only a handful of shooters that offers proper competetive gameplay for people who dont want to make a team and sign up to a website and all that.Second, this game is not pay to win. You can still spend money, but it all goes to cosmetics, so the only factor that differs between players is their skill level.Just a quick thing, the community. The community in csgo is massive, and of course it has its ups and downs. All communities have toxic players, hackers, scammers etc, as well as helpers and friendly players. But the one thing that strikes me about this game, is that the devs gave it to us, and we figured it out from there. We discovered bhopping, trading techniques and heaps of other stuff, and that is what really strikes me about this game, its that we as a community, figured this game out for ourselves, and even found some things that the devs didnt.Third, the skins. Now personally I dont see why you would spend hundreds of dollars on an item with no beneficial value whatsoever, but thats just me. But apart from that, the skins are actually a way of making money if you know how to trade. You can go from bloody 4 cent skins to a 100 dollar knife without spending a single cent on the way! (P.S never open cases, they are a complete waste of time and money).If you can get past the toxic players, the hackers, the smurfs, the scammers, the glitches and the plenty of other issues in the game, its a blast.Good luck!
