Worst game I have ever had the displeasure of playing.
Everyone needs to buy this game as soon as they can because:1. The soundtrack is amazing.2. Who doesn't like blood splattered all over the place?3. The story is... interesting.4. 1 hit kills for both you and the enemies, so you are going to die a lot, but that adds to the fun, right? RIGHT?This game is just awesome.
This game is fun. I like it a lot. I have bought it on Steam and I play it.
