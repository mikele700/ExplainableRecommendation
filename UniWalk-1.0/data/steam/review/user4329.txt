Fallout 4..... What much more comes to mind than an amazing Post-apocalyptic rpg fest full of breathtaking locations and stunning scenery! after clocking 5Hrs on the work of art i can safely say that i find this is going to be a hard game to get off when the time comes.... -Oh just one more mission- will probably be a common occurance during fights between parents and children. I Originally pre-ordered this game for Xbone but changed my mind to the PC Version shortly after, I Then sold my Xbone and now am left with a Game that i cannot run to its full potential, (16Fps on Low Sett) :/But all in all this is a beautifully created game and i Praise the team at Bethesda for making one of my all time favourite games better!! Muh love ~Ethan!
EWWW! NO! it feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DSI game do not buy took me all of a half a minute to not like this game 0.1/10
DayZ for the poor man 10/10
Edit: got a decent pc so i can do a proper review now. 10/10 for flshlight weapon physics and 3/10 for zombie detection physics
Id rather try all of this in real life but this will do :/ 10/10
BUY ALL THE ITEMS, BUILD ALL THE TURRETS, RAGE ALL THE GAMES, KILL ALL THE 12VIES, WILL RECOMMEND!!!! WILL GIVE 10/10 IF I GET MORE HATS 0/10
I Was a scrubby CoD Kid but then i brought this to play with my PC friends and im kinda ejoying it more than any other FPS game would recommend to anyone who is sceptic about Pc Fps, It is a rage worthy game online but youll get used to it 8.5 / 10 :D
Umm dead island is a very good game for someone who is ust getting into the series because of the bad backstory and difficulty, its a decent horror game and it made me pause and recollect myself a couple of time, even had me ragequiting a couple of times :')
Very good game, some of the best 8-bit graphics ive seen and free to play aswell :)
Wow Much sandbox so awesome #grrysmd
