If you are a car nut, yet love smashing things, this is the game for you. When I first saw this game on youtube 2 years ago, my mind basically imploded. The way the cars undulate and bend when crashing would give game programmers from the 90s seizures. (well I got a little spastic too but that's another story.) It's a little glitchy here and there, maybe even a crash, but my pc seems to run the game well if there are no major issues. (I have a beast laptop) the only things that I think need changing are just the sound effects. Very well conceived game. 9.2/10
When I just started, I got killed by douches with stickybombs. Now I have 350k and all the hoes wanna bang me 1337/7331

I used to LOVE this game. Seriously. I played it for hours on end. Hell, I even leveled up all my perks to lvl 25. But the new updates killed this game. The bezerker was MEANT to tank, now he is just a slow low health help-while-you-can sorta perk. The M14 is hilariously undepowered, and the hard difficulty feels harder than HoE. Let me quote the the Tripwire team. -Early Access Done Right-. What a joke.
