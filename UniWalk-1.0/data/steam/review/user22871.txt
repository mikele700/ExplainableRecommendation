Insurgency stands out as one of the more realistic shooters out there but it isn't as hardcore as those like arma. The game is easy to follow but will be tough so i suggest looking at guides. In my opinion it's not really a fast paced game but there will be moments where it will appear. Insurgency is a must try if you're looking for other fps games to play but beware, the game runs on the source engine but it seems to be badly optimized. I can get 100fps on a maxed out settings in cs go but i can get below 30fps in this game even after tweaking so much to gain the most fps i can while still gaining good visuals for me to play.
great game,not really noob frendly but it is a game u can play for hours
