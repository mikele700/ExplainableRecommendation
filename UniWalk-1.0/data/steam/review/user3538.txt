Ok, so first off, I bought this game a long time ago. Then a couple months ago I played it and there were so many new things introduced, like Telelporter, rainbow torches, and a Xenostaff??? Anyways, they-'ve made a massive change, mostly for the good of the game. (Was kind of getting boring... :P)However after you installed the update and started playing with your friends with the new -Join via Steam- option, you-'d realise how much stuff you could get. My buds and I were like -Woah dude that sick! Yeah man, lets craft everything in the game... <Not really. We thought we were going to have the time of our lives, playing a crafting/survival game together, crafting tons of items...Then after about of month of playing, I realised that we weren-'t going anywhere quickly,we thought that because we defeated the Wall of Flesh, that we were unstoppable with all of the items that we recieved from the goodie bags. We thought that until the Pirate invasion came, that really hit us hard. We eventually got through it and we kept going through the game.A couple days later my Youth minister came, he was wearing sick as armour and had awesome gear, we thought he had like finished the game! But then a couple days ago he said that the gear that he had was useless junk considering who he was up against.Thats when it hit me, bro, this game at least is gonna take about a year and a half to finish, and I have a life to live for a reason. And so that is when I bought ARK: Survival Evolved and that was good, but repeptative... Anyways, there are a lot more other games to play which are better than this, don-'t waste your money and your life on this. Buy Dota 2, its a fun game that only lasts for about 40mins a match...Only get Terraria if you don-'t want a life...
