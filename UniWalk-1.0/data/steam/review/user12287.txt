 This game is amazing I picked up this game 2 years ago, and I didn't last long. Came back the year later, again I was defeated.But I couldn't let a game beat me, and I got back into it. Here I am now, having 100% completed this game, and I can confidently say this game is possibly the best game I've ever played, despite it's  glaring  flaws.  GET THIS GAME  and you won't regret it.Ok maybe you will, but wait, push through it, and get gud, because THAT is when the game truly begins! Only then can you experience this glorious game for what it truly is.470+ deaths and NG+7, it was all worth it.Originally posted by Solaire: If only I could be so grossly incandescent... --[T]/
