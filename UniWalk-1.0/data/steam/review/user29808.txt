----I Highly reccomend this game for people who are interested in buying an Indie, Sandbox Game. As a Gamer with 1000+ Hours on it, I know firsthand There are certain people who would highly enjoy the elements of this game such as Physics Breaking, and Defying Logic. I do suggest getting this game when it goes on sale, but overall, a high-quality game for when you are bored, looking to build awesome 2d-ish builings and sculptures, or wanting to legitamately beat a game, this is definitetly the game for you.From Forests and Oceans, to Going to Hell and Living Mushrooms, there's lots of fun in this 2d-ish, 16 bit pixel hack-and-slash-and-explore game. You might also LEARN something besides proper grammar and spelling, such as different metals and ore values, and how you can edit your house to fit your expectations. This game will be fun for the whole family as the multiplayer option is built in so you can connect with other people around the world! With tons of loot to find, bosses to slay, events to conquer, and weapons to find, craft, or collect, and many different enemies, Such as Zombies and Spiders, and even a Giant Bee!Classes are a thing, but aren't your MMORPG Linear Classes. Certain Aspects of the game are either harder or easier depending on your items. Aspects like Mining depend on your Pickaxe and armor, which can increase mining speed and power. There are many other aspects such as combat, building, and travel. Mounts can make travel faster, and merchants can sell items to affect your placement speed. Accessories can be combined and shown off as vanity.Please excuse my Habits of the Dual Slash ( ---- ) and the spaces in between Quotes, astericks, and Parentheticals.
