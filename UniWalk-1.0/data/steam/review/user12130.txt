An amazing game, would definately recomend. Controls need tweeking
Is it worth $9.99, no, I enjoyed the first couple of hours discovering places but it lacks overall replay value. Headbutting random objects can get boring. If you really want this game buy it on sale, you'll thank me later.
How could you not like this game.
