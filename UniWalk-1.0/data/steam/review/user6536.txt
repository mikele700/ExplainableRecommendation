im one non-balanced ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game away from uninstalling. potentially game destroying update valve. i like the leveling system. i like the new modes and stuff, but i would rather not have them if it means i can vote to balance the teams when its 1v9 because everyone leaves when the teams arnt balanced. also people complained about the beta competitive yet you  decided to make ALL MODES have that rediculously long matchmaking lobby. WHYYYYYYYYYY!?!?!?!?!?! WHY WOULD U UPDATE A GAME AFTER GETTING BAD REVIEWS OF THE BETA?!?!??!
OK let me start by saying that this is a great game. BUT... at the moment i find there are a few core problems such as rediculous op wraith, moderate level of glitches and bugs such as freezing or getting stuck while climbing through windows or hiding in corners, as well as other relatively minor tweaks. because of most of this, the game becomes extremely frustrating, and it does not suprise me everyone leaves when they know theres a wraith... That DUCKING WRAITH! this game would make a great coop with friends IF THERE WAS A WAY TO PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS!!!!!!!! NO JOINING FRIENDS MATCHES EXCEPT ON A TOTALLY PRIVATE SERVER HOST. Also having no way to communicate with the other survivors in game makes this even more frustrating. so summary, at this time i would hold off for a few months until they really start bringing on the updates (Which is practically grunteed) and fix some of these core issues because at the moment you either have great matches or terrible ones (basically terrible if theres a wraith or if Somebody is doggy guarding all the time)
holy crap i remember playing the first one on one of the old unreal's. if this is half as good it will be my new home for the next couple of days :P
