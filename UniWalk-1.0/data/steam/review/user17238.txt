One of the most surprising games i have played all last year, it was so refreshing to see someone taking a step back from the mainstream ♥♥♥♥ and making something i will truly never forget/ If u are concidering buying this game then dont concider it, JUST DI IT, trust me its VERY good. 10/10  possibly best game 2015.
CS GO is slowly taking over my life. Someone help me!
Nuclear throne is a very different rouge like game. It is very fast paced and bullet hell like. But this game has a lot of hidden depth to it and if you are a fan of the binding of The Binding Of Isaac then you will enjoy this game
