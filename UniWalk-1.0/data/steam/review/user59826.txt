No Mans Sky did not live up to the hype. It is by no means a bad game, but if you came here looking for the mythical 'base building, multiplayer space game', then you will be dissapointed. otherwise, it's a nice, relaxing game about exploring hundreds of millions of proceduraly generated planets. The storyline is somewhat difficult to follow, but it is very well written and quite chilling. Maybe wait for a sale before purchasing.
