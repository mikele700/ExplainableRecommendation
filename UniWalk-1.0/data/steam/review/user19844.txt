Graphics and gameplay is fantastic in Elite : Dangerous. The only issue i would have with this game is it is a bit grindy to get  higher level and powerful ships.
its ok...
Kung Fury is like your average 80's action movie, Terrible Puns, Cliche's, Jokes, Lines and plot. But i don't care! All these terrible aspects make it hilarious to watch, as well as the awesome and stunning VFX.I definately recommend watching this, Kung Fury is bloody amazing.
Firaxis and 2K yet again, have pulled off a smart stratergy game. The unit turn system is very polished. Althought it can kick you in the ♥♥♥♥ when you have that 89% chance of hitting the target (because your 1 metre away with a shotgun) and the 11% win. But it is awesome when you have a 5% chance to hit the target and actually hit it. XCOM's base mechanics are good with the different floors all serving different purposes as well as the World time system.
Civ is a fantastic game. Turn Based Stratergy and very in depth. it looks complicated but once you get the hang of itits all fun. good and bad situtations, things can go either way. The endings fell a bit short but the expansion pack Brave new world fixed thatawesome game 9.5/10
