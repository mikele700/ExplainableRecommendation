Its no longer just a game, its a experiance for the soul.I played GTA V on the xbox since it first came out and this is quiet honestly the best experiance i've had with it ever since then, and i've had some great experiances.If you want a game where you can do pretty much anything you want and have it look amazing at the same time then this is a game you dont want to pass up.
Great game to play with friends.
