At times I almost thought that air was real. Sound is the great triumph of Insurgency, and it reveals its power in the muffled cracks of gunfire or in the whispered squish of boots of gravel. It isn't fluff; I can't count how many times I scored a kill because I heard an enemy making too much racket in an adjoining room. The sound design works so well in part because the dreary environments scattered across the 12 maps complement it, even if they never achieve the same level of mastery. New World has done a decent job with the Source engine, but the graphics fare better in maps depicting cramped streets of Baghdad than in more open environments featuring hills and trees. Out there, it's only a step above the original Counter-Strike.
