Finished it again and again. Pretty fun to come back and play through it again while forcing myself to use different loadouts. Great fusion of action points based planning with cooldown timer and real time action.(You get to activate a mode that freezes everything and allows you to plan moves, might not execute the way you want it exactly. Also a penalty of disabling all function use after activating said feature unless you have a modifier attached to a function. If you wonder what functions are, just think them as weapons you can use, and those weapons can also be used as a weapons modifier, tons of combinations to pummel everything in your way lul)
