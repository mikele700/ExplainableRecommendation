This is a game in two parts, and unfortunately, I have to review it is such.I can sum up part one in one word: Brilliant!Here we have two characters in two seemingly unrelated situations. One has been chosen as a human sacrifice to a monster that has been terrorising the local villages for generations, the other is alone on a deep-space exploration vessel. You, as the player, have to guide these two through their own stories of -escape-.I found the story interesting, and then when the two characters briefly meet, then abruptly change places...On to part two, and in a word: Disapointing.After months of waiting, we get this lacklustre, almost generic point-and-click game that relies more on player knowlege than imersion in the story. I got stuck on several puzzles, only to discover that the solution requires finding something AS THE OTHER CHARACTER, totally destroying any immersion that I may have still had, and dumping me into the mode of -player behind the keyboard- instead.And then, when the final solution required co-ordinating the actions of both characters at the same time, without either character even knowing what the other is doing, well, I guess that-'s the -Broken- part of Broken Age.While I would like to recomend this game based on the first part, I just can-'t. Sorry.
A challenging and fun puzzler with a good story.
