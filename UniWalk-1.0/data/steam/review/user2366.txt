This game is like Battlefield if it had a stroke, going through the many different, gigantic and immersive planets as the 3 factions filled with free to play scrubs yell at the other team for using OP weapons and explaining why each faction is better than the other.  Don't get me wrong this game is great and has some of the most undoubtedly immersive experiences I have ever seen in any game before and can blow your mind with some of the most epic battles that only console peasants dream of.  But in the end it's just a bunch of rascist ♥♥♥♥♥♥ complaining about who is more OP and running into enemy bases with their pants down, accepting the massive amount of butt ♥♥♥♥! I r8 8/8 I totally don't finger my prost8 don't h8 it's g8.
