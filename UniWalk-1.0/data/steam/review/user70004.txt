Ok it has a good story but the combat lets it down a bit the voice acting is great but I do miss Kevin Conroy, Mark Hammil ect. I dont think this is a bad game but it's just not as good as the others it seems to me like a good dlc not a good game and don't get me started on the glitches I give it 7.7 out of 10. An ok game I recomened it to all Batman fans(like myself).
