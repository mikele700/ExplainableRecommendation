One of my very first purchases AND A DANG GOOD ONE TOO! The hours of rage worth it when you finally reach the end of the level, thats if your keyboard/gamepad is still intact. Not disappointed in any way, never ran into any bugs or glitches. A great challenge for anyone (even the best of platformers), and i recommend it to everyone. Well done devs!
