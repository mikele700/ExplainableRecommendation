When i started playing STO (Star Trek Online) I was brand new to the universe, i had maybe only watched the newest movie, other than that i knew nothing.Since then I have watched every single episode released to air and all of the movies, no game has ever gotten me so engrossed with the lore before, that itself is a testament to the great albeit cheasy writing that the game has.Now to the game itself...It is a very easy to run game and still looks presentable even on minimal settings, the gameplay is a little confusing at first however there are tutorials both in and out of the game that are of great assistance. The story itself follows a character that you create that is a member of one of the three main factions (Federation, Kilingon Empire and Romulan Republic) this gives you access to a large number of humanoid races and the abilty to an extent create your own race. The missions themselves are refreshing and divided into multiple story arcs to make it easier to find a specific mission you may want to repeat.Combat is done in a great way, both space and ground combat is simple yet fun, all three playable classes (Tactical, Engineer, Science) all have defined roles that are easy to understand and easier to play as.Overall STO is a great experience that is in no way P2W, you don't need top tier ships that cost real money to peform well, sure they help but you don't need them. Tier 4 and 5 ships can still be competitive once you hit lvl 50-60 and begin the endgame content.
A great game that takes permadeath to a new level but making so much fun, graphics have a nice retro feel that gives the game a great sense of imerrsion along with its great soundtrack.Recentally the free expansion Advanced Edition arrived and gave the players more ships and new mechanics to play with making an already great game even better!To sum it up FTL: Faster Than Light is a great experiance to play and is more than worth the money it costs, i can easily recommend this game to anybody that loves games with an actual challenge and sense of achievement!
Don-'t get me wrong, ARK is a fun game and it is unique in the fact that your tools include the Dinos and other annimals, however i still can-'t recommend the game due to the simple fact that the Devs are currently (in my opinion) more focused on adding new features that have bugs associated with them than fixing the ones that are currently in the game. It ruins the experience if your constantly finding bugs that may be small still ruin things or make the game frustrating. Another major concern i have is that you need a pretty damn good rig in order to run this, i can usually run all my games (Steam and non-steam) at their highest settings, ARK however for whatever reason i have severe trouble to run on even its lowest settings. Now i know some of you will go -Get a better rig- well that doesn-'t solve much as it is the job of the Dev team to make the game accessible to as many people as they can, and in order to do that they need to get on top of fixing and optimising the game rather than adding more features. so no i can-'t reccommend the game IN ITS CURRENT STATE, however if the Dev team is able to address the many issues with this game and do something simmilar to what Space Engineers is doing right now, where the devs arehalting addition of features and are just focusing on fixing the current bugs, then i-'d give it a positive review...
