Fantastic spaceship encounter/ship management rogue-like indy title with exceptional restro art style and music. Highly unique and original; and worth many playthroughs for all the ship unlocks alone! Probably my favourite indy title to date.
The best thing since sliced bread!
An intense emotional experience - especially the conclusion. Few actual game elements and more cinematic than actual game, but the plot, the voice acting, and the characters make this into something you should not miss. 10/10 and I don't say this lightly.
