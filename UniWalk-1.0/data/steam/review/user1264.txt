I want to punch the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs in the face.♥♥♥♥ the final boss fight and its stupid unfair shadow.♥♥♥♥ this game
The slow-mo in this game is really well done, its story is presented in a really nice way and getting to completely oblidarate with bullets is awesome. My only complaint would be the weird sensitivity. And you're in an area with little/no cover, have fun dying. A lot. I mean like, jump onto the ground repeatedly like an idiot to survive.
7.8/10 too much water.But actually its a pretty good FPS with fun abilitys and a pretty good story to back it up.Winter Blast+Frozen Field+Wrench= Wrench Smashing.
