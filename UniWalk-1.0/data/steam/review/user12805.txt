Lume has a novel appearance and a mildly devious twist on the usual sorts of puzzles in games like these. That said, it's really only very mildly devious - ooh, the compass is twisted 45 degrees and north isn't up, oh so tricky! - and I completed the game in half an hour... oh yes, it's very short. For the $7 I paid for it, I'm incredibly disappointed. Don't bother.
So painfully dull.
I love this game, so hard.
You need this game. Delightfully silly, deviously odd, and dangerously addictive.
