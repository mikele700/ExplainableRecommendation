When I originally got gifted Dead Realm, I thought it was just gonna be an overhyped game full of Youtube fanboys, but boy was I wrong. This game is so worth buying, and there is no other games like it. 10/10 IGN
-Downloads game-1 minute in, finds out you cant change controls, big flaw for a left hander.-5 minutes in, finds a guys base and joins the good man, offers me food and riches.-10 minutes in, we find and try to kill a guy but he is 2 spooky and my friend shoots me in the back of my head.-11 minutes in, spawn back in and run around for awhile to find a road with a guy sitting while moving on it, singing cheerleader.-15 minutes in, finds out how to do the sitting while moving glitch and joins the singing man and we glide down the road together into the sunlight.10/10 would sing again
Oh boy how I wish I had a job to fuel my cs:go case unboxing addiction T_T
Let's just say, best CoD since Black Ops II, BO3 has just saved the Call of Duty Franchise in the nick of time
Everyone complains and moans about this game, but it is fun if you play it in a fun way. Play with a group of mates over Skype/Teamspeak/Raidcall and actually get engaged into the game. It has seen alot of improvement and i haven't came across a hacker once in my 70+ hours of gameplay. The game slowly and gradually gets updates and its the funnest of the survivals i have played. Day Z has super ♥♥♥♥ed up zombies and this game has an easier way to acquire weapons, making it a more PvP based survival.To finish, great game and i recommend getting it if you have friends to play with, and don't get too attached to your loots ;)
I ran out of ammo within a couple rounds, so I just ran into a pile of zombies and died. Spawned in again and both guns still had no ammo. 10/10
