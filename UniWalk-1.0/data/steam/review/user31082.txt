My queen was so stupid she thought the best way to survive an arrow to the leg was to push it in further...she died.
Ive always wondered what it would be like to be a woman who dates a serial killer bird...Now I know.
8.5/10Great game, that doesnt outstay its welcome and has some of the funnest and most realistic video game characters iv come a cross in a long while. Also looks gorgeous.Only real flaws are - Power hungry as ♥♥♥♥ (had to play on low settings just to get a solid frame rate, and my laptop can play games like xcom with little problem)- Quite buggy, mainly some visual bugs, occasionaly the shadows screw up. Only major one is whenever someone starts a line of conversation, theres a chance that all audio stops for about 1-2 seconds. DIdnt happen all the time, but enough to be a strong annoyance.
Get it on handheld.
Some guy broke into my house after I spent 3 days building it, and locked me up on the top floor.10/10 wudplayagan
This game ♥♥♥♥ed with me...In all the best ways.Greatest military shooter campaign ever made.
Just remember to save often or else you will throw a hammer at your screen.
