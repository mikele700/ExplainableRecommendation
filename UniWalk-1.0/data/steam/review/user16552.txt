free to play or premium this game is fun no matter what.
The hardest part is kicking ♥♥♥ while you're out of bubble gum.
The achievement system is broken, however it is a cool game even if you're just after the black rose knife in TF2.
It's like Split/Second for the PS2 era, and finishing a race with the hood staying on your car is wicked hard.
Not bad, it's kinda like a younger brother of the Silent Hill series.
