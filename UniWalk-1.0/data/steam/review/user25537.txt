The Culling. A last man standing multiplayer deathmatch game with survival elements (basic crafting, looting, basic resource gathering). It's a Battle Royale-esque game (though more like The Condemned IMO), that takes place inside a dome with 16 contestants and up to 25 minute rounds.The game itself has a good concept but overall it feels quite cheap.The melee combat system uses a rock, paper, scissors mechanism consisting of attack, block & shove. The balancing with the system is fine IMO, no complaints here. (Shoving briefly staggers the opponent or 'defeats' their block for those wondering.)The system is quite clunky in its current state though. Seeing as melee combat is essentially the main aspect of the game, it is quite disappointing. The feedback when you land a blow or get struck isn't great either. Rust has better melee feedback (& that isn't saying much).Add bad netcode and high latency servers on top of that and it just feels very sloppy. (AWS cloud servers btw.. Horrible for real-time/twitch games. I hope they eventually move to proper dedicated servers!)I understand it's in Early Access, but compared to the other Early Access games I've played, this is lacking. I really wanted to like this game but the basic elements that make up the core gameplay have been ...I wouldn't say poorly but rather, crudely executed.Honestly, I would probably come back to this game sometime in the future once more time has been spent developing the core mechanics. I see a promising future ahead for this game as long as they iron out the kinks and continue working on and improving the current foundations of the game, but I don't see that happening for at least another 6+ months so that's why I cannot recommend the game at this point in time.
