The ties are enchanted by the devil.11/10
This game is literally a diet product of 'System Shock 2' minus the twist.You start in a common bay witouth guns.You go to medicals.You go to the engineer deck.You go to the control room for fix something.You have to destroy something for go the Hydroponics.You go to Hydroponics.You go the the bowls to go to the attached ship and do something.You talk with somebody inside the marine ship.You enter the Rickenbacker... i mean the Valor.You find that somebody dead.You go to the cargo bays looking finally for the real bad guy.--Missing inside the monster mind segments--You fight the boss.At least Bioshock polish the System Shock 2 storyline a bit more...Anyway the ambient of the game is very good, very creepy and the removal of the twist give it a bit more of generic game than a System Shock 2 ripoff.If youre looking for a sequel of System Shock 2 with the same ambient, play this one, if youre looking the same story and twists play Bioshock.
