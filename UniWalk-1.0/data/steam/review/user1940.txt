I used to love this game but now it feels like one of thos crappy games put together by two guys thinking hey we should make a game.this game was amazing and i put alot of hours in it.now the game has really no content and is easy to get to level 100, oh and also the new patch has killed my game and i now cant play
Its very strict on its minimum reqierments but yeah runs perfectly smooth for me.you need a good machine to run this game but if you do its a great gameSpecsCase- Syclone Star Cruiser Motherboard- MSI Krait Gaming Z170A Graphics Card- Geforce GTX 970 Harddrive- Samsung SSD 850 Power Supply- Corsair VS650 Processor- Intel Core i5 Ram- Hyper X Fury-EDIT-ive put around another thirty hours into the game. still fine only about 3-4 stutters since i started playingbut the constant liberate more provinces to get missions is getting annoying
the most emotonal game....ever
fun
youll never stop playing it theres 1 million things to do!
its great so worth the money
