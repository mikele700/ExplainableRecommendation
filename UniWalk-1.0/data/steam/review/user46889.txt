For starters, i absolutely love 8-bit pixel games. They are my favorite.Absolutely love this software. I am one of the people who know absolutely nothing about programming, but once I got this, and started watching a few tutorials by Shaun Spalding. it made everything so much easier. Now I know a little more then what i did before and can start learning more about amazing 8-bit pixel games, and possibly start making my own.I just hope that i can get professional before the steam sale goes away. Paycheck Come in please!
