this game is enjoyable 100/100
this is laggy ♥♥♥♥♥ 0/100
currently in alpha this is a waste of money 0/10022/09/14: this game is still garbage with less weapons than the mod, no vehicles, no custom maps and no missions, traders or base building from epoch so there is literally nothing to do, in its current form it is easily the most dissapointing game i have ever played, do not spend your precious euros on this game
I'm not suprised that ♥♥♥♥ing scum such as PewDiePie, Markiplier and Captain Sparkles play ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pay 2 win games like war thunder. When you have to pay 20 dollars to have the best weapons  in a game blame middle aged men recording themselves screaming at slender and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ java games. ♥♥♥♥s like PewDiePie are payed to advertise piece of ♥♥♥♥ ripoff games and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s like Tobuscus promote autistic behaviour when at Drive Thrus.Peace out PewDiePie ♥♥♥♥s.
this game is awful 0/100
WTF is this ♥♥♥♥, 0/100, avoid at all costs.
