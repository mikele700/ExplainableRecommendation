its very nicely done, there are a few bugs but it is early access so they can be forgiven but other than that its a very enjoyable game
ever wanted to give master cheif a chefs hat....ever wanted to have fat mario dress up as darth vader.....ever wanted to blow up the golden gate bridge....(list goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on for eternity)
best elder scrolls yet this is what got me into the elder scrolls series and i promise if your human, elf or beast you will absolutely love this game
Perfect game for those that like to relax... for a very very very long time. (I do not recommend speeding it will mess you up.. alot)
very nicely built game but hard to start an uprising
