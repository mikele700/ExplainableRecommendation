Goodness - take me bak 15 years and this would ahave been a resonable game - gameplay, interface, and speed of game is poor all things considered.
Enjoyable game - reasonable graphics - lots of quests and side chains. very customazable charachters. Purchased montly sub as I enjoyed it so much!  great way to encourage subscribers.
Not my thing
not very playable at prpesent - interface is very laggy and clumsy
Good game. in Alpha Stage I can has great potential as a survival game! addictive as heck!
