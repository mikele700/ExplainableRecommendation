Most games are losing consumers because they were using Pay-to-Win mechanics.Valve learns from this and made this game purely on skills...or do they?What triumphs over skills? over $$$$ you spent on cosmetics? What is it that pros can't even beat?Lag.Lag wins games.And this game is the hallmark example put on a pedestal representing 'Lag' in all its glory.Lag will eat at your soul, heaving in lust at your sudden extrapolate of chivalrous attitude.And one of the accomplice that assist to this dentriment is that NO ONE KNOWS of your current condition. Its like having mental disease and people are thinking...hes lying. Why u ♥♥♥♥ing lying?(This is how I am IRL.) Anyways...yeah, this game is reacting to inertia; not because it suck. Not because of negligence. But its because of LAG. :( Im so sad Imma cry. DISCLAIMER: the bad news is, there is no better alternative. I've tried LoL, not to brag, but it was easy like literally. I was playing support(just like in dota) and I ♥♥♥♥ing carried the game.(it was Morgana btw). Ridiculous really.
