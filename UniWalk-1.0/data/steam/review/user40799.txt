This game is now PLAYABLE! There is loot to be found! Zombies don-'t phase through walls and smack you in the ♥♥♥♥! I don-'t walk up stairs and receive a black screen and watch the all too familiar words -You are dead- phase onto the screen. A good step in the right direction by the devs. If it continues like this and fulfills its potential, giving us an immersive, post-apocalyptic survival game we were promised then the game will be incredible. Though I still can-'t recommend it due to the high price tag for an unfinished game that will remain unfinished for a very, very long time and sadly even on sales it is still rather high.
If you're a veteran from DotA 1, prepare to yell at your ♥♥♥♥-tier friends as they do some of the dumbest ♥♥♥♥ you have ever seen! 10/10 game
