Got this game around Christmas, havent played it yet cos my comp seemed to fail to run it, BUT all technicalities aside.... I give it a solid.. 5/7! Oh the .3 hours are attempting to launch it!
Amazing Game, should give it a shot.Probably one of the best or the best Moba's available atm with finding the right people in the community can be great and make some great friends, on australian servers it doesnt seem to be as toxic as other people say, game is hard to learn once you start playing but it's well worth it once you pick it up, never get bored because every match is in some way different. Over a hundred heroes all free to play and to master, only use of money is cosmetics which has no actual effect on the gameplay itself, only giving the hero a unique look, this is my most played and favourite game and i dont see myself getting bored of it anytime soon. 10/10Edit: 2564 hours in still not bored
