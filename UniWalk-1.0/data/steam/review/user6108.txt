What I likeLoved the storylineArtstyle is greatGameplay is simple yet I personally found it addictiveDon't need to be really hardcore completionist to finish the gameA difficulty slider (only for boss fights I believe)Good sountrackA room for people to farm (love it)Them feelsHowever I read the reviews before I played it, so I went in expecting to cry, but sadly I didn't. Could also be cause I've watched sadder anime that I didn't cry for this oneWhat I didn't likeRather simple in the sense that those who are expecting a complex rpg style would be disappointedGameplay is rather short (I managed to finish it in one sitting and there's a hint on where you might want to save so if you want to, you only need to replay that section of the game to discover more)Overall for a first game, it's really good. I hope to see more in the future
