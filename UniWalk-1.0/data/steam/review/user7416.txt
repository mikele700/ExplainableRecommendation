Although this game is only in beta or whatever, It is amazing! It has so much content for a game of it's price. It's got modding supoort and there are heaps of mods out there for it that only improve the game futher. The only drawbacks of this game to date are the servers. Some of them can be quite laggy nomatter how close you are to them, but it's getting better. The lag does not make it hard to however.All in all I would definatly reccomend this game. 9/10
