great game play and playing with friends is probably the best thing you can do.My good friends are moving far away and we can play this game with eathother and have the great fun we had while we were living close together
this game is the only game i can play for one hour and say it's AWSOME!!!but i have a problem when I play with friends my game crashes but it doesnt stop me playing
Alien Vs Predator is a great game to play with your friends but by your self can be kinda boring but with friends it is relly worth it
great game it has got good grapics. it is like a medieval COD
