This is an honest review of Ark Survival Evolved:I have played 150 hours in 4 weeks.For those who have not played Ark, it is the best survival game i've ever played. Alot of people say this game is bad because you loose all your stuff over night but this is only on PVP servers. You can also play on PVE servers where your stuff can not be stolen. The amount of content in this game is amazing. If you have not bought the game already i highly recommend it. If you are worried about loosing your stuff play on a PVE server and you will not regret it. I recommend community PVE servers like MMOBlitz's server. If you are interested in PVP then you will have the risk of loosing all your stuff when you are not online but this can be stopped by having an active player at all times.I highly recommend Ark to anyone who is interested in it.You won't be disapointed.
A game of pure epicness. Check it out if u haven't played it already.
Great game. Check it out if u haven't palyed it already.

I started back in roughly 2012, played if for a year then stopped.I recently got back into the game and i'm loving it.Now for the review:ROTMG is an awesome game. A simple concept turned hardcore. The things thats different about ROTMG is that when you die you die for good (and you lose all your items).  This concept makes the game challenging and makes you try hard not to die. The loot system is also really good so you feel rewarded when you almost die getting an awesome new item.Even though you only get 1 character slot by default, the game is free and it is worth paying $20 to get the begginers pack.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
