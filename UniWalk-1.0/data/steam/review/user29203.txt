This game is fun, Bit buggy with the multiplayer for me in that i cant connect through the actual game. I do have fun with it though. But its not worth its full price id wait for a sail honestly, See what i did there?Sail?...I bought this game for one dollar and think that is the appropriate price, also if you're buying this game you should make another friend buy it aswell as it is dull playing by yourself. in the end, Extremely fun and a classic, simple masterpiece of a game
I LOVE THIS GAME
I get in the game, not next to any decent loot or anythingdecide to start making a blowgun make the caltrops then hear footseteps behind me i finish making the blowgun before the footsteps start running towards me, i turn around and blow a dart right at him. i miss turn to fist and start beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of him (he also is returning the favour) i'm winning the fight and the guy knows it too. he starts running I shoot him with a dart, he starts coughing and throwing up i run up and beat him to death while he is throwing up and coughing. 10/10 would see a pscycharatrist again.
this game is fun play it.
