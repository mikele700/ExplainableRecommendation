Time Consuming as Hell and loads of Cheaters in Matchmaking to ruin your day. Too much recoil in the guns, going back to Call Of Duty, P90 is overpowered Blizzard Entertainment please nerf the AWP to make it a lag shot didn't even need to look at the enemy to scare him to death with your big gun kill and remove Dirty 2 from your list of games. 8/8 would unbuy this game and buy again or unbuy and use the $15 dollars to get a Burger at UBurger or something. A real life burger is worth more than a virtual burger.
I just like to walk around nude. 10/10 would flash again
