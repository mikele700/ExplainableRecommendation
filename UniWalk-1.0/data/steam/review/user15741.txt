There is a game where you can be a goat.It is called Goat SImulator.Being a Goat is fun.There is a room where you can crash your game.10/10
Loving the new update, there is one problem, my mac lags a lot on the new update which forces me to play on the lowest graphics, it is a great game overall though 9 1/2 /10
BOODIFUL
This game, now the trailer looks quite babiesh but once you play a few matches you really get into it, i got to rank 4 in my first match so fun, but there is a few things, you need to add crouch and sprint, this would just make it more interesting to play as you run away from your enemies, apart from these two errors, a great game! Good work
