A very fun game.+Graphics are nice+Combat is cute and easy+Quests are simple+Open World+Senarios are just amazing+Stamina, Hunger, Armour and Health Bars+Eating animation is cute+You can wear animal heads-Bug: When i open my inventory then go to map, all of my items vanish :(-Questionable FPS lagI do understand it's an early access.It's still worth getting.
Game is Very good, some multiplayer issues. Mainly lag and connecting but tou can fix your -Failing to Connect issue- by verifying your files (it only takes less than a second).Pros and Cons:+ Boss Fights.+ Good amount of weapons.+ SoundTrack is Awesome.+ Multiple types of zombies to kill.+ Character Customization.+ Leveling up system.+ Character and Weapon upgrades.+ Character Customization (Appearance).+ The Sounds in the game are good.+ -Mystery Fridge- (gives you a random weapon or meat, or it can just teleport somewhere else on the map).+ Upgrade Machine to upgrade your lovely weapons :)+ Bots are Amazing (path finding for them is kinda strange but they know how to shoot a gun)+ Edit the way the Bots look.+ Achievements give ZKW coins that allow you to buy weapons, weapon upgrades, clothing for your character and more. There is acutally a point to getting these achievements.- 4 Maps only (more will be added in future updates).- Can get boring without friends :(- That weird connecting to freinds issue (which can be easily resolved by verifying files).- Server Lag (when you shoot your gun, the bullets have a second delay before exiting the gun).All of the issues should be solved soonDevs are nice people :)One of them changed my freinds username when he made an error typing it :DI Rate this game a nice    8/10.
Ran straight through The cross fire.....Happily made it through with a MASSIVE hole on my chest and most of my head was gone.Still alive thankfully.Almost made it to a health pack...but before i got there a rouge missle hit me causing my upper half of my body to explode, leaving my bottom half to be contolled by ME XD.But i died after a few seconds.         Would play it again    11/10R.I.P Loadout...
Things you should know about the Cannibals:1. Some of these Cannibals can climb trees. (i learnt this the hard way).2. Cannibals will investigate....3. Cannibals work as a team and will assist each other.4. They can have either torches or flashlights, yes flashlights.5. They are fast, strong and hey can jump long distances (well some of them).6. Avoid them as best as possible.7. If one sees you, attempt to kill it straight away.8. If there are three or more, RUN!!9. They are in groups of four or more.10. They like night walks.And these Devs don't f*ck around.
An excellent city builder. No tech tree, no fancy jigamawots to help you.What this game Has and what you can do in this game:> The game has seasons. e.g: Winter, Spring, Summer...> Make a town> Your town will have houses, crop fields, woodcutter, blacksmiths and many more structures> Have to take care of your sla....Villagers.> Villagers will start of as labourers> You can give villagers individual Jobs> Children Eat your food and they do F*ck all (They soon grow up to adults)> Adults will eventually die from old age> The game has a good Tutorial> You have to survive the winter, if you don-'t have enough fire wood your Villagers will freeze and dieThis game is very detailed. I have survived 8 years so far. IM STILL GOING WOOOH. (ingame years -duh-).Some tips I find helpfull:<> Roads make your villagers walk faster<> Crops are very good for food but it needs to grow<> If some of your structures are to far away from eachother put your stockpiles in between, so your villagers don-'t have to walk as far to get to the stockpiles.<> Educated Villagers are more efficient at their Jobs.<> Make sure you stock up on firewood for the winter.<> Place the Forester near many trees.Hope these tips help.If you get this game. The only thing I can say is     GOOD LUCK and DON-'T Starve and Freeze to Death.
