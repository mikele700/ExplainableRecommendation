This may be a unpopular opinion, but I don't recommend Black Mesa. Like so many, I was super interested in experiencing a modern take on the classic from a decade and a half ago that had changed so much about FPS gaming. I hadn't played Half Life in some 10 years, so it really would be a fresh experience for me.Navigating the environment felt clunky - I felt like I was always catching on a corner or ladder or vent entrance and having to fight the level as much as the enemies. Speaking of fighting, combat was a dreadful chore. Even after getting in the classic gaming mindset - an age before regenerating health and endless cover based shooting- there was no pleasure in the combat. Right from the start it was just methodical and clinical and ultimately boring.Finally, the level design: I like the IDEA of new elements being added in- new physics based puzzles, the knockover-able turrents... but experiencing them felt token and wasted.Now, maybe some of my complaints are in fact just true to the original- I'm sure Half Life probably did have clunky (albeit mindblowing at the time) combat. But the face of the matter is that in 2016 playing this game, I personally didn't have a headcrabs fart worth of fun. Sorry guys.
Pros: A fun hack'n'slash combat style with enjoyable fight mechanics and optional stealth elements. Manual sword mode is an interesting and well executed gameplay gimmick. Cons: Little to no explanations of gameplay mechanics (unless you specifcally go into the help menus or stop story mode to do VR missions), over extended Kojima cutscenes (unless you're into that), extremely short story mode on normal difficulty, controls clearly suited better to console controller (especially when manually controlling the sword or camera).Tentative recommendation, especially for people who enjoy hack'n'slashers.
