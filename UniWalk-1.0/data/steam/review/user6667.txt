Good game, except the terrible ban system. Got banned for 7 days because my pc crashed, other than that good game.
Some people might play -The Walking Dead- for the feels and story, this game makes all those feels useless. 10/10 feels and tears.
Had it until Steam removed my key... still no idea why...  But from what I played, amazing game.
I know some people who have devoted their lives to this game and are as white as salt because of how they have never seen sunslight, this game will ruin your life, but hell, you'll have fun doing it!9.5/10
A great free to play game with not much of a need to pay, although it did crash and I am still unable to lauch. But still  a great game.
Amazing
Playing this game will definnetly require a squire to protect you and also bazillions of guns.10/10
