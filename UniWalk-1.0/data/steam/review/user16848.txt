Loadout is a gem of a game. It is extremely exciting, fast pased and gib (and nudity) packed fun ride. Loadout allows you to pretty much create the gun of your dreams, from lasers and bullets, to spikey balls and rockets. You can change the stocks on guns, crosshairs, fire modes, payload, type of class of gun (LMG etc) and more. There are a lot of equipment choices to freshen things up and turn the tables on an opponent. There are a huge amount of maps and many gametypes.  This game is extremely fun, with no one match being the same.With that in mind, I recommend people who live in Europe, North America and Asia to play. Any other area and you get extreme lag as these are the only server areas you can go to (some bs about not enough ppl playing on them but when I go to Asia servers, most ppl have high ping). Loadout is a fun game full of character. There is no other game like this out there, making it totally unique. If you want a game that lets you customize everything about your character, is free to play (cosmetics cost dosh) and is great fun, then Loadout is for you.
