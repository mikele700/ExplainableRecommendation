I would-'ve recommended this game if it was a bit shorter and had a more refind jumping mechanic.Whilst the storyline was somewhat flaky I enjoyed it; the whole premise behind the game was interesting to me.The backstory into the main character was really interesting and sad!Graphics were nice and the music was really well done, puzzles were nice but a tad on the easy side.The major downfall to this game was the controls when it came to jumping. I would spend a lot of frustrating time trying to clear a section of tedious jumps only to have my character decide not to run as fast as he was or overshoot the thing or undershoot it when he was fine before. I-'d fall and have to start again. Sometimes if you mess up because of it you just die and the somewhat dodgey save system would set you back further away.I had to completely quit the game at one point to reset an elevator that got stuck half way and so I couldn-'t get up to it, reloading the -last checkpoint- didn-'t do anything.Also there is a lot of aimless wondering, it-'s not that bad as you can take the time to enjoy the seneary but then again when you-'ve failed a jump multiple times all you want to do is get this thing finished.There were a few times when the way wasn-'t all that clear (mainly my fault) but coupled with the bad jumps it was frustrating at times.I wouldnt recommend it at the current price, if it was to go on sale then by all means try it out. I should mention I played using the keyboard and mouse so that may have had a negative impact on gameplay as it seems to support a controller.If you love platforming then by all means pick it up, I-'m terribly into those types of games and got it without knowing it was going to consist of a lot of platforming.
