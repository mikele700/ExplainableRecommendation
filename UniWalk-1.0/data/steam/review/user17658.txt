After spending the better part of the last 2 weeks playing bloodbourne and dark souls in eager preperation and anticipation, I am overjoyed to say that DARK SOULS 3 is an AMAZING GAME. Though i've only put three hours into the game, the feeling of overcoming enemies and traversing the world is one of the strongest in the franchise, more so than the original DARK SOULS. The combat is the tightest its ever been with a feeling of DARK SOULS and BLOODBOURNE mixed in togather. The game runs like butter on max setting without a single crash or glitch (lucky me). If your a fan of the DARK SOULS franchise and fantasy RPG's in general, this is a must buy. Already a contender for game of the year.
