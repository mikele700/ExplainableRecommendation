This game took me 10 minutes to wrack up 30.02 seconds of survival, totally worth it and hey, if you have Dark Souls, you-'re totally prepared for this game because a lot of your deaths will be accidents or -rookie mistakes-, I-'ve died many a times right at the start simply because I misjudged the distances.
