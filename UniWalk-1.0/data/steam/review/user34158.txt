Do not think of this game as minecraft, do not think of it as DayZ or any survival games you have played up to this point.  Space engineers is in a seperste world with more complicated movement, more complicated crafting and the ability to kill you very quickly and very often.  This game is for the players who like to explore, who enjoy creating new methods to complete the same repetative task.  with the game in early access not all features are available, and some areas of the game could be fixed (landing gears) but with regular new content being added to the game it just draws you back time and time again.
