This is a good game if you like combat and at times it can get really fun and I like it how you can find weapons and it is fun to play as all the classes so I do recommend this game if you don't have it get it's free But you will need to buy stuff to be able to trade items away But even if you don't want to buy stuff you can get premuim from The Gift To Premuim items that your friend can buy for you but it is fun with out premuim anyway so  I do recommend this game so if you don't have it get play it and see if you will like this.
