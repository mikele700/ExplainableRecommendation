I personally think that this game is a high performance, highly detailed and very creative MMO game. The fact about how you can explore the world of skyrim and become a mage, warrior or theif to level yourself up and work your way up to your full potential. Just exploring the world of skyrim is a really fun thing. But in the end its the BEST MMO GAME that I've seen so far.
