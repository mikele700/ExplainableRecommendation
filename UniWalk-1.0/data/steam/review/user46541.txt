At first this game seemed like just another puzzel game, but as i emerged myself into the atmoshphere of -limbo- it was a very deep game, the use of the black and white, negative space artwork defines this game, this is truely a unique and excelent game, towards the end of the game the puzzels almost seemed impossible, a masterpeice of a game, with its one of a kind artstyle, combined with the physics and puzzels it has no trouble defining its self from any other game, definatle one of the best games i have played.11/10It is truely an imersifying game...
