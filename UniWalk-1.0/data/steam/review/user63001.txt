This game is amazing. I headed into it completely blind, and i was astounded as to the sheer enormity of it. Every session i play i find a new item or enemy. The game world is so big I havent been out of the first sector yet and im still surprised to the hugeness of it. Plus you get all of this for free.I love the skill advancement, its non-linear and your are free to spec into anything you want. There are no classes to restrict you, telling you how to play the game. The only classes are the ones you make yourself.
Please welcome the sequel to 'Watch Grass Grow', its 'Watch a Giant, Floating, Sentient Space Rock Grow'! Now with trees!Every 5 hours of playtime gets you one completely useless prop for FREE!
If you like epicness, this is for you. Warning: will make you feel pro even though you are not.
good game. Try it, its free.
Challenging resource maagement game. Dark and atmospheric.
Fly can stop a falling leaf mid air and move it around. Thumbs up.
The cover speaks for itself. An amazing game.
