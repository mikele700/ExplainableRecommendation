FTL : Had A Great Time on My 8 Hour Flight :) More Fun When You Unlock Other Ships :)
Bad Performance Issues Non Original IdeaDifferent From Other Game In It SeriesWas Great Game On The -PSP- But I Thought The Experience Was Different. The Open Map Idea From -'Need For Speed-' But I Personally Burnout Series I saw was much different from NFS. I Like the Old Modes On The Burnout Like Rampage Which Was Always Fun. Also The Multiplayer Was Almost Existent Since Last Time I Played. Think You Still Can Find This Game In A Cheap Bundle.
Payday 2 Is BetterPayday Is Awesome i think the maps are better than payday 2It Was Free Still Have Good Solid Game Play With tones of reply after you finish all the raids. Go Loud or Stealth :)
Payday 2... It great fun, it has good community. There was like no trolls etc, when i played the online. All the memeber was helpful and no annoying 5 year old on the mic.Already Infamous 3 thanks for my friend grinding exp with meh. If you going to buy the game go look up HoxHud mod it really helpful.
