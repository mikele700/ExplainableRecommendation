After a long hard think of this games Traits and such, I would give this a solid 9 out of 10.The reason why is because The game seems almost perfect though I did find one issue with the gamer such as, Re used dead bodies,Guys I get theres not all that much time but would it kill you to atleast change there body position?. But aside from that its overall a good game with some Quirks to, In the start and does a good job of making you care and feel for the charecters.Graphics...For them to go with this style was definately a good choice the graphics arant super ultra realstic, They take a more comic book art style and the reason why it fits the game better is becuase the Walking dead started in comic book form, And for them to interigrate the same style into a game and make it look Brillent then stick with it, Not only does it make the game more timeless but make you feel like that your in the comic book following the story of someone else.The Zombies in this game, in the first season they reused alot of zombie skins and it seems like they will do the same in season two and to be honest the skins are pretty cool and so is zombie animation the Reused Zombie skins could use abit more randomiztion but overall excuseble given the amount of time these poeple have, Gotta scarfiece something right?This game is fine sometimes quirky and extremly emotional if your looking for a game to rip out your heart then patch it up t only rip it right back out again, This is your game.Review by Reaver and the Doctor, Friend me if you wanna get you game reviewed or get a opinion till then, Derp on.
CORRECTION LADIES AND GENTLEMENAfter servel billion problems I have deemed this game to be 1/10, Why?problems such asTextures breaking 24'7Taking forever to load Addons breaking every dayFaulty codingSometimes crashes your DesktopHas a dishonest CreatorCrashes every time you try to do somethingOH and well there is lots of lots and lots lagAnd its not worth your money it might cost you 10 dollars now but it will cost you Trillions in hospitial bills from the stress!~Sincerly Reaver.PS. Jeddalo says screw you Garry NewmanPSS. Thanks for making machinmas an Ordeal from Reaver
Haunted Memories has A bright future ahead of it, The graphics are stunning, Gameplay is abit wonky just a tiny bit, While the Slender NPC works well I sitll feel like hes just an NPC and the story is pretty Good, I look foward to this games future and hope you do to, ps. Can be confusing at times and 1 building bothers me alot, the tower its useless last time I played.
