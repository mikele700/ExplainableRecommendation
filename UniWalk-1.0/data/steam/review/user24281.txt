This game brings on all new levels of stress.Without the keyboard controls this game would be impossible. It takes a bit to remember/memorise the controls, but once you nail it it's so satisfying! Be prepared to get frustrated and annoyed... and be able to memorise a bunch of different ingredient keys. I highly recommend this game - super fun yet intense!
