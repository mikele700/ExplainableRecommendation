Top notch space game game for 200 hours before it gets kinda grindy. Great community. Be sure to join a squad to ease the loneliness- they'll keep you in the game. Must have experience!
Toxic community second only to rust
One of the best RTS games I've ever played. Got both the macro and micro aspects downpat 10/10.
Awesome game. Just a bit buggy though, takes 15 mins to start lol.
The best co-op shooter I've ever played, good with friends but beware of toxic strangers>Joins random public game (hosted by people who want their game to be private but are too dumb to set it)>Cops abuse from some players to gtfo>Chooses battle rifle as secondary>Blasts these players off the map>Gets banned10/10 would recommend wrecking dumb toxic ♥♥♥♥s. This game actually gives you the option to do so.
The chat gave my eyes cancer10/10 most carcinogenic community I've ever been exposed to
I absolutely love this game. No issues on my side with a GTX670- just pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics and mayhem. Great game for friend meetups, to take turns as Rico and laugh at the hilarious things that happen often. 10/10 superb open world game
