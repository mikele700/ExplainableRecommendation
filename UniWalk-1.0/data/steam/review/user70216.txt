Great game, always fun to play with friends.
Pretty cancerous and has a toxic community but a good competitive FPS with Russians. What more could you ask for?
Played the game mostly because of Leafy great platforming game that takes a bit of skill and timing. This game is especially fun and you should get it while on sale. :)
