Pay to Play trash. -1/10. You can't play AFK either.
One of the WORST clickers I've played. Very terrible, it's so bad it's a copy of one of the BEST clickers: Clicker Heros. ♥♥♥♥ this game and the devs.
It's buggy and I can't play through the first chapter.
One of the best games from The Sims. 100x better than Sims 4. I highly recommend this game even though this game has expensive DLC.
It's bad. Really bad.
One of the greatest games I've ever played. This game has everything, hardly no bugs, guns, gore and blood! And best of all, the birth of the Half-Life series.
The game is too buggy and hard to play with the bugs.
