Anyways Great game and highly addictive even for the first minute also THIS BLURRY EFFECTS MAKES ME CONFUSE xD finally a game that dosent cost a single dollar like those useless games that has a price and especially I LIKE PIXEL
the game was Great in all 9.5/10 Review:during the gameplay my fun went to this one its like watching a movie about zombies ad your in iti like these type of games that is free roaming and a pledge of killing zombies butstill i saw some glitch or bug... first is the server we know that the server list was remove but since i use evolve i got now groupsthe problem is anytime i do something like picking items or dropping in the server i got kicked outmy friends dont know why i have been kicked since its our server... then the reason that i got kickwas i was hacking items during in-game WHAT?!?! im not even hacking i was picking items then blameto me i cheat if anyone experience this then it needs to be fix....Second dunno if its part of the game or error..when i use the car jack item on the car which is the water it blew after i use it i dont knowif this is an error thought.... ok for the new update now for suspected teleport ... ._.
