This game is addictive, frustrating and wonderful all at the same time.10/10 would paint all the walls red and blue again!
This used to be a fantastic hat simulator, now it is a fantastic queuing simulator of sadness.
This game has consumed my life, like how I assume actually be in prison would. I have learnt the joys of capital punishment, the importance of yard showers and necessity of large hallways.Before this game everything I knew about prisons I learnt for Orange is the New Black now with my extensive knowledge and experience from 100+ hours I am some sort of useless prison system expert!10/10
