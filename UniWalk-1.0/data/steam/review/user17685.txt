 6 hours in a row after playing NMS.  Ireally enjoyed it alot more than NMS its just way more to do.
This game is addictive there is so much to see if u like crafting and digging thats ur game.
What a great game it really feels like DarkSouls in 2D ithink its pretty difficult but still hell a lot of fun!!
hearthstone and a bit of warhammer regicide its really nice tons of fun. 1 thing the mainmenue is straight up from hearthstone but i guess thats not so bad.
One of the Best Games in my library!!
Loving this game.Lots of gameplay besides the story. If u like Dragonball thats the game for u. MP is not really working yet but that should be fixed soon.
Cant believe it but this games is so much fun and free. Enjoy
