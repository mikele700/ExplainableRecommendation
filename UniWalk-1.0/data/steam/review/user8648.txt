Crashes front of car into back of another car, remembers how in GTA SA it would damage the front of both cars when you do that, released all that built up confusion of my 6 y/o selfThis game is really easy to mod if your into that, and is not only cars as it natively supports boats and planes without any extra coding. If your not, its still i cool game to drive around and set up the playsets you couldn't afford as a child in game.If you were able to afford play sets as a kid and you still show interest in this at the very least you can support the devs.
i recommend this game if you liked the other games.
Buying this game now is like buying a concept ship in star citizen, the devs have shown us what they can do with the dx9 release and how that didnt have many bugs, and its just a matter of time before they iron out the bugs completley from dx11. From my experience its extremley hard to join a server properly, so the only reason to buy this game now is to give the devs more resources.
fun
