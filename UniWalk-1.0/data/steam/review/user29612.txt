Love the actual board game, but this just takes the stress out of it. No screwing around setting up or shuffling cards, and definitely love the fact it's impossible to lose pieces! Presentation stays true to the board game and isn't overly flashy or drawn-out, and the music and SFX are appropriate. It's a pretty good purchase overall! Now, if only Arkham Horror would get the same treatment...
