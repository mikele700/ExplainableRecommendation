This game questions the laws of physics. 10/10.
It's like Call of Duty, except its not. 10/10.
This game will make you hate hexagons (and anything to do with lines).Straight off, this game is HARD. You will probably rage a fair bit, but that just somehow motivates you to go on further. You are a triangle that has to dodge six sides of incoming lines using the left and right arrow keys or A and D. You will hear the 'Game Over' voice alot, but just completing a level makes you feel so good. The music is very good, as expected in this genre. I would personally rate this 10/10 because I enjoy playing 'rage-games', and this is a great one at that.
I remember having this on console awhile back, and I had a blast with it. There are so many things done right in this, truely a spectacular racing game. EA shut down the store, which is such a shame because that Jansen hovered at 88 mph. Multiplayer is stil great fun, although not too many people play it anymore so it's best to get a bunch of friends and have a good time. A great classic, a great buy. If you enjoy racing games and for some odd reason never played this, I would definitely recommend it.
