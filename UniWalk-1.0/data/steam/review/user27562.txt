This game is really fun! So far, I've loved this game. There are so many good things I could say about this game, but I'll stick with a few.The Good:-The Research Tree and Units are expansive and diverse. It's great being able to choose specialties and weapons for particular units.-The Music in this game is pretty good. It also fits in with events that are happening. I especially love the epic song that plays when you build the giant mech.-The FPS side is used less often, obviously. However, it is really fun leading your soldiers into battle. The FPS adds to the scale of the game as well as adds attachment to your army.-Infiltrating bases is another thing I love about this game. It makes you look for weak points in the enemy base. It also makes you really think when planning an attack on the enemy base. You can't just run in and gun it out. It's satisfying when a mission goes successfully- but punishing when it doesn't.-Also, I like how this game has character. Once you start playing the FPS side, you'll notice a lot of humour.The Bad:-The AI can be a bit annoying. Sometimes they'll roll into water and die. Other times, they won't guard an area properly. I'd like to see a bit more options for units.-Computer difficulty. The easisest difficulty is not easy. They're hyper-aggressive and relentless. -The Sounds also need a bit of a change.To sum it up, I love this game. The developer has done an amazing job with the limited resources they have.
