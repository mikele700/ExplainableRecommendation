A game like this required me to spend about half an hour working out the controls and how to walk on the first level, and a bit on second, but it quickly got more easy the further I got in the game. I found certain (not all) places were easier with the controller, but some levels were still that hard, restart-a-few-times-before-you-get-it, levels. I recommend this game for anyone, not just Cephalopods like myself. The workshop is great, and the physics are pretty funny.
After finishing Portal, I thought all the fun was over in terms of pissfarting around. When I bought Portal 2 for $5 (I had a coupon), I thought maybe it still was possible. I found the levels were considerably harder than the first one's, and the storyline was much longer, and somehow a tad more humerous. The introduction of different features, and new multiplayer support really amazed me. Even though I bought it for a quarter of its price, I still think it would be worth the $20. Plus it has controller support, so that's cool.
