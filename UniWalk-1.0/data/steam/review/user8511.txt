Euro Truck Simulator is a game worth buying, yes ETS2 has more things, detail,etc but ETS is more basic, easy and still fun, and with a few basic mods eg: Real logos mod, it makes the game abit better and the graphics are still not bad for these days.
This game is so crap you can't stop playing it.
