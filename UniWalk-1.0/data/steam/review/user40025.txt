The more you play it, the more you'll come to like it. It's a great game/sim for those interested as to how x scenario may go down in the real world or for those who simply want to play a simulator involving air and naval combat from a commanders point of view. (Ground based combat is pretty crude and feels like its there just for the sake of been there)At first when you load up a scenario/mission, you'll just stuff around and work out how to do what and when and why. Maybe pop open your browser in the middle of it a couple of times and search the forums to figure some things out, but if you persist you'll find its an enjoyable experience even if your not heavily into simulators of this sort, simply due to the depth and vairability the same scenario can have even with slightest of vairations in your actions. 1 scenario can play out 100 different ways. You can play it for an hour and only feel like 5 or 10 minutes have passed. If you want a game you can play when its raining outside and the internet is down (as is often the case for myself), or when you've simply got time to spare and want to play a game that is something different this will hit the spot. :)
