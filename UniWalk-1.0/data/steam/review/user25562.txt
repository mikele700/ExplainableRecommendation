I have to say I enjoyed this game more than I expected. This is a great game for if you want to get into strategy games. It has fun little animations and OMG  it even has a Ghandi that declares war on everyone. It is also good for mods to get the most out of your money. It could do better in the multiplayer side of things its ok. Always fun to blow up with beautiful nukes. BEND YOUR KNEES TO MY DOMINION
