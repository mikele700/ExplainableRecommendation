its like minecraft with portals 10/10 - ign
Honestly, i don-'t see why everyone hates this game. It-'s great, has tons of content, and the only thing i really think it lacks right now is -classes-, like what terraria has. Sure, it may not of been updated for a while. But nightlies are kind of like updates, so there-'s honestly no reason to hate this. Starbound has a few things it could improve on, like monster generation and terrain generation, but other than that it-'s near perfect. I-'d rate starbound 8.5/10
Back when i used to play this, it pulled me in. It was hard, and i hated it. But i thought to myself -One day i-'m going to get good at this.-30ish hours in, with 48 hours of research and homework on how to be good, and i still sucked.Horrible game, russians everywhere, don-'t bother.
Typical 8 hour singleplayer.
Chances are, if you're reading this, Chivalry is not the game for you. It's your typical first person swordfighting game, but it has a massive, MASSIVE learning curve.I'd never recommend this game until it becomes an actual fighting game instead of a blocking simulation.

Play game, get TF2 hat, craft TF2 hat into another TF2 hat.Delete game afterwards.
It was good for it's time, nowadays it's just hard and has bad graphics.
Overkill removed microtransactions.
