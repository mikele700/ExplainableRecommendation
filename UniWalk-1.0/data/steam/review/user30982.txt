This game is great fun for the whole family! Ever wanted to learn about Christianity but everything was too boring? This game is great fun and very educational. It does a great job of balancing the age-appropriate gameplay and intruguing facts that makes it the game it is.666/420 -( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)- - Team Fish

This game is frighteneningly realistic and will make you forget you are actually playing a game. You will start out in an massive group orgy of naked men on a random island with little to no civilisation and will continue to play around with each other with nothing but rocks, until you eventually decide that tools will do the job better.8/8 m8 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
