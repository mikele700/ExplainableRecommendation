I play this with my family watching.666/666 will play while family is watching again
For me, playing this game did not feel like CoD or other FPS games where you feel good just killing faceless grunts. The Line is a very well-written game. Fundametally, the gameplay is run-of-the-mill. It does not have distinctive mechanics; its just your usual take-cover TPS game. For me, the gunplay became pretty monotonous after many levels. Also, the characters have clich√© identities. Heres your generic heroic guys, the special companions, and the guy-you-served-with character. Though, the graphics are also one of its redeeming qualities, its beautiful, the environments are very well-made. And finally, the story. Holy s**t, The Line's story is one of the best stories I've ever come across in gaming. I wouldn't try to spoil anything story-related; so I will just drop this:THE STORY WILL MESS YOU UP
