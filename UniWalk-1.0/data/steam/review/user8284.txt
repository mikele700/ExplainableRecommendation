I know Alot of people are giving this game a bad rap, And yes it's got some really bad bugs--FPS problems as well, BUT it does feel good to play and is by far way better than the last few CoD games that have been released.I enjoy playing it and I am one of the lucky few where the game seems to work fine aside from FPS drops.As for everyone down voting this game stop it we need to push getting the game fixed not Kill it it's one of the best cods that's been released.
This game is good fun, there are a few things that can be annoying, but you learn to get around them.As for the people that have issuses with Some of the merc perks like Naders Marty, your pretty stupid to run up to a Nadder you just downed and try to knife her...Earning Credits is alittle slow but Everyones gota make money some how atleast they let you try the mercs before you buy so you don-'t wast money or C on one that you don-'t like...It-'s a Team based game it-'s all and good to be -pro- but with out your team backing you, it-'s GG.I find the game really awesome even when my teams crying and ♥♥♥♥♥ing cause their losing.Spawn camping in this is BS people are just too stupid to take other routs from spawn.all in all 8--10 game I-'d give it a ten if C was a bit more easy to earn, with out spending $4. :P
