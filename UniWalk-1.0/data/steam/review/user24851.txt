After around 44 hours of non-stop gameplay and content, I finally decided to write a review.Batman Arkham Origins is one of the best cinematic batman games ever. Note that I said 'cinematic'. Because the story and plot really makes you feel that you're watching a movie, even quick time events are added mid cinematics for more involvement. Don't hear what others say about the glitches. I rarely even see them, only glitching out while gliding at certain times.Gameplay is as refined as ever, brought over from akrham city. And the boss fights, oh the lovely boss fights. Sure, some of it have rehashed movesets from the previous games, but mostly freaking amazing, far better than that arkham tank game (if you know what i mean). Story is interesting and encourages you to finish it, and there are some very emotional moments that i dont want to spoil. Some skins are made free by completing certain objectives which is really appreciated. I really enjoy the overall game as I play this gritty, violent batman who doesn't even bat an eye to break every bone he sees to get what he wants. In short, if you are looking for a batman game set in winter, has awesome boss fights, amazing story, buy this gameright now during its weekend sale. The DLC is also worth it too, unfortunately there are no sale prices for that.
This is one of the most challenging games I've ever played. you would need both eye and hand coordination to beat this game, which will be difficult has one of your hands will definitely be occupied, plus the sound effects and imagery will distract you from beating the game. Truly a masterpiece that will stand along side the triple A games.  10/10 would nyan again
game is awesome. it is AWESOME! one of the best looking free to play games yet. i just felt that the health system is kinda weird. u start as a beginner but die often as yr armor is too low
