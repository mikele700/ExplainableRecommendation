H1z1 a true zombie survival game.... More like bend you over a desk and ♥♥♥♥ you while taking your money and is basically the next Infestation Survivor Stories, this game has not changed since release, Its just truning into a money grab ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of broken promises and lies. Ive even had one of their customer support members admit that the dev team has been cut down to a very small number and then tried to back it up by saying -Oh but they will work hard to deliver the best gaming experience they can-.... so mirco transactions and basically doing ♥♥♥♥ all apart from taking peoples money. good job guys like give ya self a pat on the back!
