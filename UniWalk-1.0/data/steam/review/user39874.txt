Excellent Game - Recommend for sure! Few bugs I've noticed - if you swing and then hit escape twice and click again as you reload into the game you can bug the swings and get two or three swings at once. Works with paddling as well.I can't seem to kill sharks however that might not be implemented yet. Not sure.As far as the game goes with playability and graphics - it's amazing. Game looks very refined already, can't wait to see the improvements as they go along. Will love to see how they continue to add content to the game, would love to see bigger islands with proper forests and things like that. Hopefully implement other boats or NPCs or something like that too. But if you want to just waste time this game so far is excellent for that purpose. See how long you can survive, what kind of salvage items you can find. The flippers and goggles make swimming a lot easier for instance. Good variety, again can't wait to see where they take it from here.
