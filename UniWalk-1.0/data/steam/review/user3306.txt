the game is pretty good not the best game for beginers but if ure not lazy like iam and finish the campaing u would be 20x better the campaing is pretty on point with historical battles execpt the game is very arcady and if u want a relistecic experience get the spear head mod.  my one complaint there is some much added dlc and would recomened getting the masters eddition if u are in to rts games but wait till summer sales as i got the masres eddition for cheaper than the game 
this is not a game this is a adventure i will not say more as this game is ruined spoiled so all i can say is get the game now
good but u need a decent computer to run it great fun
