Best RTS game ever, why it isnt more well known is beyond me.Keep punching -+atm- into chat to help you out if your trying to get into the game, (single player skirmish only) it gives you +1000 energy and metal.It will help you out until you get the hang of the game, also push the +/= key a few times to speed the game up it runs a little slow as standard, crank it up to +10. Spent alot of my time playing this back when it first came out loved it then and I still love it now. Truly awesome game.
Awesome game a must have
