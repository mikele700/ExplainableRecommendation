A key was provided by the Developer of the game for the review purposes.so this game is similar to angry birds in the same sense of pulling back to character to go forward i think this game is good for when you are bored or need something to pass the time and it is very fun
has everything a game needs a good story characters and furries10/10 would want to buy the game againand the cheeki breeki rating system i give it aCheeki-Breeki/Cheeki-Breeki
i really enjoyed it but alot hate it i think postal 3 reminds me of postal 1 its not like postal 2 wich is more funny this is more story based like postal 1 expect i think postal 2 exactly like postal 1 just more silly and less stpory based yeah in postal 3 the melee weapons dont work but the guns work smoothly and nice plus this game is short but so much fun i give it a 11/10
10/10
