I see alot of people raving on in the reviews section about SUPERHOT coming exlusivly for oculus rift. This is not the case. The devs have stated that it will come to ALL VR headsets with hand tracking controllers eventually, and this will not effect regular SUPERHOT. Calm the ♥♥♥♥ down. Reviewing the game poorly because of the devs descision regarding the VR experience and not on the gameplay itself is completely ridiculous. This review will be based off of the gameplay and my personal experience with SUPERHOT and not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tery that is the rest of these reviews. SUPERHOT is one of the most innnovative first person shooters i have ever experienced in my gaming life. It provides A new challenge to the average Gamer to think differently about how they approach a battle using a rarely used mechanic, time. The story in the main part of the game is amazing, it makes you feel as though the game is really comeing alive and there is something sinister about what your doing and why your killing these red guys. With the endless and challenge modes the player is able to extend their experience with SUPERHOT and challenge thier friends in time trail like challenges and test their SUPERHOT skills in a variety of challenges. With soon to come FREE DLC, i can see myself spending alot more time in the world of SUPERHOT.In conclusion, great game, would definetly reccomend it to my mates, 25 bucks may seem a bit expensive but for me it was worth it. Hope to see this game grow.
