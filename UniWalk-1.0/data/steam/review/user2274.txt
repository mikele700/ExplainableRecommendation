DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!Why? I shall tell you why.Not bbecause of the amazing storyline.ot because of the wide rangeof levels, weapons and desings.Not because of the fact that it is one of the best games in human history. Becuase after you play this...You will buy Ep 1Then Ep 2Then, like me.......YOU WILL SPEND THE REST OF YOUR GODDMAN ♥♥♥♥ING DAYS SITTING IN A CORNER. CRYING YOUR MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ING EYES OUT BECAUSE THAT ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ SHIT ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ COMPANY VALVE WONT RELASE THE THIRD EPISODE.YOUR EYES WILL ♥♥♥♥ING BLEED, STARING AT THE ♥♥♥♥ING SCREEN EVERY DAY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.YOUR EARS WILL BLEED , LISTENING TO THE ♥♥♥♥ING DEATH SOUND AS YOU WAIT, IN HYSTERICS FOR THE LAST EPISODE.THIS GAME IS SO GOOD, WHEN YOU FINISH IT ON THE CLIFFHAGER, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REST UNTIL YOU GET THE THIRD ♥♥♥♥ING EPISODE>Don't buy this gameKeep your sanity
