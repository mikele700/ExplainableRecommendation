Amazing Game with great graphics and beautiful unique features. I have played this game since September and when i first got into a server it blew my mind! I definitely recommend this fantastic game to people who like to chill and have a good time on PVE. But i'm not a PVE person. I'm more of a PVP type of guy, so when i joined the first Pvp server there was action straight away. Just one warning for new players that are thinking of buying this game... Watch out for big tribes that will come on the server looking innocent then before you know it blow up your base and kill all your dinos overnight. (I'm talking generally the asians). Also one last thing, you have to tweak a couple of settings to make it run smoother for people who don't have beefy computers like me.Anyway i give this game a 9/10 because although it's great and all... There is some lag and problems here and there. - Majormelk
