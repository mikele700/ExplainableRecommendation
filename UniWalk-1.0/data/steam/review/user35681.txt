A conversation between me and Cydran about Age of Mythology: Extended Edition.AA | Cydran: Was it as well remade as you expected?AA | Cydran: or as you were hoping?Veldar: Well.Veldar: It's the same game, just with the expansion I never got, it feels dated, I can tell there are flaws and comming from C&C generals, a much faster game AoM feels very slow to start, getting your economy right is essential which is fine but I prefer the mirco of C&C to the marco of AoM, but the game still has a special place in my heart as the first game I remember asking for and it being my first PC title.Veldar: I still love it though.AA | Cydran: Very nice. I assume that means that new players going into the version of AoM on Steam might not enjoy it as much as they would if they played the game in the past?Veldar: Well to make a judgement you have to put RTS into two piles:Veldar: Mirco and MarcoVeldar: Micro is the faster games C&C generals and Warcraft 3, matchs should last 5 - 15 minutes.Veldar: Where Macro, games like AoM, AoE 3 and SubCom are more about early economy and massing armies then pitting them against each other.AA | Cydran: I seeVeldar: I prefer Micro so a Macro game feels slower to me, I still very much enjoy it and I'll play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it but I know that it's not the best RTS by any means.
