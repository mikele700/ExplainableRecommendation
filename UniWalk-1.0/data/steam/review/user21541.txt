this is a great game the rts action is awesome and its very different from most warhammer games its alot about placement and how u made your fleet before the game even starts if u are looking for something to get a rts feel from a scaled down more focused on what u have made and worked on through leveling this rts is good for u even if u havent heard of warhammer which makes this game great cause warhammer games most have alot of background about the races so people with warhammer 40k knowlegde would have instantly a better understanding but due to this game being very unlike all the others its a learning curve for allthe downside is how u want to improve how u play is very trial and error even then u cant see stats of where u went wrong or how u played bad into someone and just makes u feel powerless and theres no meta or builds that really suit races meaning alot of it will require u to waste time to see if its good or not but tbh this just u waste time in the game but if u arent going for the competive side of this then this isnt a huge problem
its just the best shooter ive ever played the graphics are awesome the game play is realistic as a fps could ever be it is the PUB STOMBER of bf4 n cod what ever number or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ name there up too
