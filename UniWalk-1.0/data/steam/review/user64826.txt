Every now and then a game with a really cool concept gets put on steam and i play it and i have fun. Rise Of Flight United is a great example of a good game being screwed over entirely by one feature. That feature is the dread microtransactions, the lifeblood of free games and the terrible part of gaming. At the start of the game you have 3 planes or so, thats all the planes you have unless you want to pay $20 DOLLARS FOR FOUR STUPID PLANES!!! FOUR!!! The game is good overall but technically only 3 planes in the damn game i can not reccomend this.
Mod allows you to play in candyland. 10--10 would brutally murder people again.
Total war shogun 2 is the best total war ever. It oozes with juicy, lovely quality, from the new avatar conquest multiplayer to the enhanced singleplayer mechanics i couldn't recommend it enough.
