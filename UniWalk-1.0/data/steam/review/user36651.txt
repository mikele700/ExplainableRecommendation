A very cool game if u like dinosaurs and a gameplay similar to dayz.u will die ALOT. u go collecting wood, collect stone, berries, make ur first weapon, get meat, try to tame and after about an hour die by a lv 10 raptor or trex. Basically anything will try to kill u. But the game itself looks beautiful, has alot of detail and a wide range of dinosaurs. This game is still early access which means it has alot of bugs. Overall this is a good game but could do with a few fixes
