This game is fun, a bit of a grind at low tiers when all you have is tier 1 smgs, but a simple gun platform will see you through to getting the grenade launchers which make everything easier. best part of the game is definitely seeing everyone else's approach to building a vehicle, from sleek fighters with walls of guns on wheels.
I think that this game is fantastic, for those complaining about the entry cost, think of it this way, those who own the original get it for much cheaper like an expansion pack, it's not uncommon for a game to release such a pack with only a handful of units and some tweaks to the base game, ala SOASE and SupCom FA and SupCom 2 infinite war. The titan's are a fantastic addition to the game and allow for better assaulting of an enemy homeworld
