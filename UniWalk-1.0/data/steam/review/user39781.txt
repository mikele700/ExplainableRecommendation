7 Days To Die is one of the easiest games I have ever played. I am not sure why the standard is set so low. Even on my slowest play through, it only ever took me 2 days to die. Game is too easy, please fix.In all seriousness, this game was pretty bad ♥♥♥. It took me a couple of attemps to not be ♥♥♥♥ at the game, but by my third or fourth death, I started to learn that dogs are the most evilist ♥♥♥♥ out there and to avoid at all costs. After making it past that slight learning curve, the game got pretty simple. The single player gameplay essentially goes like this. Day time: Gather resources for eating, drinking and building. Build structures or fortify a pre-built house.Night time: Stay inside your house. Cry. Pray for morning. Pray extra hard every 7th night. (Once you have overcome the fear of falling off the roof, you will be able to start raining death from above).Morning: Fix your house, because zombies are disrespectful af and break all of your stuff.REPEAT.
First of all, this game gave me cancer. Not like, haha funny cancer, but actual cancer. I spent most of the early hours of this game running through radiated areas completely naked, with nothing but a few fire sticks and my trusty rock named Wilson.The aim of the game is to not get rust on any of your metal items. The easy part about this is that WIlson is made of stone, so you're practically unstoppable. You spend a large portion of the game cutting down trees and killing animals, because f**k greenpeace. Eventually you build a house out of twigs, mud and tears only to have it blown to bits by a**hats with C4. When you leave the game, you do not actually leave, you simply go into an induced coma where you dream of real life, only to wake up back in the land of rust where some 12 year old has kicked down your door, violated your comatosed body and taken you for everything you have. The moral of the game is to always sign a prenup. 3/10, would more than likely not dine again - IGN
