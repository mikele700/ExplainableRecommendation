This Game is pretty fun for crap quality graphics
I highly recommend you play this game. It exeeded my expectations! I thought it was going to be another MOBA like LoL or Dota 2. No this brought something fresh to the table. It is that good i have already spent real life money on this game (which is hard to get me to do, i hate wasting money on in-game items) and planning to do so again.Add me on smite my username is TheYiyant if you do decide to play hope to see you on the battlefields of the gods!
This game is one of the best games that i have played. I deffinately reccomend it especially if you love stratigy. I love to play this because i love stratigy (without stratigy i would be a mindless thug playing Call of Duty no offence). Me and my friend think it would be the perfect game to play for geography in school because it has some geological stuff in it (don't steal this idea or unless you put my name in for example thank you Ethan/Behemoth for suggesting this). Deffinately play it and maybe even challenge me if you dare and yea. recap Deffinately play it challenge me if you want and watch my youtube (soon going to be uploading Civilizations once i fix my recorder) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB3SBiZrI_bzEb8XUpWpxjg
