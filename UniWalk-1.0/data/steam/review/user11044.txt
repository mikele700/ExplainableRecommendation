T-Boned a car, whilst going 323km/h down a road, launching it vertically 20 meters in the air and 30 meters down the road.Respawned from the crash, car is still in the air10/10 would Crash againEdited Proper Review as of 11/12/2014.Warning 'The Crew' is not a Simulation racing game, it is an ARCADE Racer.if you are looking for a decently fun racing game to play. 'The Crew' is a considerable choice for this.There are few issues however with the game such as.The Cops and pursuers are OP, especially so in the earlier levels of the game. Later on as you become a higher level, they do become less OP, but are still OP but not to the same level as they were when you first begun the game. The cops aren't that hard if you know how to use the Specs of cars properly. There is a large number of people complaining about this issue, most likely a majority of these people, have no clue how to drive each of the specs of cars correctly. (Don't be one of these people, learn the specs correctly).Warning, this isn't a Racing Simulator don't be like the Racing Elitest like those that are prowling the Forums.'The Crew' does have some other teething issues, such as occasional lag during co-op missions, Lack of connectivity to other players and difficulty connecting to friend when attempting to join each others crew's (I'm from a country that the national average internet speed is 10 mbps, and the lag isn't even that horrendous for me) .  These issues, are considered to be Teething issues, as the game hasn't even ben out for 2 full weeks yet, the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about all of these issues aren't taking this into consideration, and these people aren't taking in to consideration that almost no games at launch are 100% Glitch Free / 100% Bug Free / Balance correctly / have no lag and connection between players is working correctly.This being said 'The Crew' is actually quite an enjoyable game to play, as summarised, there are a balancing issues, connectivity issues, etc If you are thinking of purchasing this game, honestly if you don't mind not playing with some friends or dealing with occasional OP AI pursurer/cops, then you should definitely purchase this game.If any of these issues do effect you eg occassional Lag, connectivity issues with friends or you get really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the cops for some reason, as if you have a deep seeded issue with all forms of Law Enforcement. Then i would wait a bit for these issues to be fixed by ubisoft.7/10 (would be 8.5 or 9, if the connectivity issues and balancing issues were corrected :D )
