yea its okay to me campain sucked but my opinion i only buy cod for multi campain pretty much always ♥♥♥♥ liked multi fast paced so would recomend but only for multi
Amazing game its decently hard to drive if you're using a keyboard and if you're trying to use the mouse as steering good luck your gonna need it :P only thing with this game is the multiplayer in non existant and would be lucky to find anyone and a full lobby is like unheard of but yea great game looks amazing graphics are amazing aswell even if you're not running it at ultra pre dec
