9/11 would bang
very very emotional, great story
okay so how do i start. this really isnt a game, you walk around and listen to a narrator with a nice voice. the game really isnt much fun, its the sort of thing that i may have enjoyed when i was 12 on a flash game site and i wanted to spend an hour or 2.i really would not reccomend buying this at its price. on sale sure i guess if you want to check it out you can, but at full price it definitely isnt worth it. (i bought it on sale)
