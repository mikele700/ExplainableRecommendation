Such a fun game to play highly recommened
Everyone is hating on this Game because of DLC. Who cares, dont buy it if you dont want to and stop complaining its still in early access, thats keeping the price down, this game is awesome and really big, yes there are bugs but name a game without any. They will get it done, Probably just need more money to keep it improving at such a rate.If they said it was a full game now people would cry and winge that its not finished, get real poeple these devs have a lot to do and can probably do alot more than the rest of you. People will always cry and complain, just let them do what they gotta do to get the game done and stop making it worse by trashing the game and writing bad reviews, it puts people off, so they get less money and cant do as much.PS. This game is so fun so are the new map and primitive, yet to try the dlc but it looks amazing so cant wait to 11/10 would recommend.
