I wouldn-'t buy this game unless it was on sale. It has many bugs and bad character modelling and laziness with some textures. it is however fun to play -My Career- and against friends, but you may experience issues with the NBA servers which is another major flaw in design. All in all an OK game if you enjot basketball otherwise not great.
