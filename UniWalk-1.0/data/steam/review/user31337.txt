Great game, excellent spiritual successor to Ragnarok. Most problems such as lag and the trading system will be ironed out. A lot of these issues are the creators attempting to fight gold farmers. It fills me with determination that they are activiely trying to address that issue. Playing from Australia with awful ping, but the SEA server will be moved to SEA and lag shouldn't be an issue.
