Overall such a great game. Sandbox : Great and Fun to learnMultiplayer: So many gamemodes whether it be Hide n Seek or Death Run. With G-mod the game is fully made to your liking, you can chill out with mates on your favorite gamemode or learn how to build a car on sandbox.The possibilities are endless, unlike this review.10/10
Should You Get This Game? Of courseEven though it came out a while ago? Yes, The Game is equal to if not even better than 2014's latest games.Just Like GTA, except you get a grappling hook and it is MUCH CHEAPER
Awesome FPS. Wayy Better than COD!
Best Free to play game out there!
