Downloaded the free version. Completely wasted my time. A free version is meant to create desire to spend money on this game but fails miserably. I got to my 3rd ball on the first game and it came up and said I had too many points so buy the game or it resets back to the start again. All this in about 30 seconds of game play.This game has a big NO from me.
I have been playing Civilisation games since they first started. When I am bored and tired of playing action packed games and just want to relax this is the game I reach for. Over the years Civilisation has improved graphics but that is about it. I suppose it is hard to improve on perfection.If this is the first Civilisation that you have played I 100% totally recommend it. But, if you are like me, I cant recommend it as there is nothing in it that really gives you a feeling of a new adventure.
This is one of the most addictive games you will play. It really is easy to learn yet difficult to master type of game. This game will never die :) but you might...
