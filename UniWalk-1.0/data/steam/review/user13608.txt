I MANAGED TO FLY INTO A BIKE AND THEN CRASH IT INTO A LOW GRAVITY FACILTY... 8/8 M8 IGN
Great game and all, but it is possibly the worst game to play at the start, it provides next to no help with starting out and if you don't know someone who already plays this game you might as well just quit because it is the most unfriendly new-user game in the history of steam.
