this is one of the raddest games i've played in ages.not often a game has me burst out laughing and tear my soul out with sadness all in one sittingthe 'combat' is fresh and exciting, and all the little chunks of flavour everywhere are really incredibleall of you should go play this gamenowdo itits worth the money and then some A++(also muffet is best character â™¥)
I was skeptical at first.A rogue-like RPG Tower Defense Adventure Action game?You what mate?Then I played it.Wow, it's so addictive. And fun.I definitely reccomend it, grab yourself a squad and don't forget to build bases.You'll become attached to your troops. Like my brave Ninja who lead the enemy into my traps countless times. RIP ol' buddy. ;n;
