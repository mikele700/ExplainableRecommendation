very good game very suprised on how fun it is specialy this early still a few bug i would like to fixed this early other than that the maker has done extremely well and i look forward to seeing the future of this game ps. one of the bugs that i dont like is that the enemy can go through walls thats what i would like to see fix all in all A+
this game is great now that they have fixed all the bugs and evrything in it but there is still one thing thing that has got me disliking it and this isnt really about the game it self its more about the people host games nearly every second lobby i go into of late is hacked which is really sad cause this game thrives on working as a team and yere it just pissis me off about that if they could some how devlope a anti jhack or somthing that would be great but till then i have to jump from lobby to lobby trying to find legit games
i love this game but when i shift tab to answere a message or voice chat my freinds i cant shift tab back in i cant do anything to play the game again i have to end task the game but other than that love the game its great worth the money
i loved the campaign but in skirmish vs ai is really difficult even with easy ai the just rush you that quickly i wouldnt reccomend buy the game just for the campaign as good as it is
