As of this version, there's not an awful lot to do... I can see great potential, but it's still very much a WIP! I've done a reveiw video on my YouTube channel of this game.http://youtu.be/QKA8ucZSyXw
I've been a fan of space simulators for ages, but Kerbal Space Program is definitely one of the best I've used! It is easy enough to use that someone with no experience can pick it up and play, but also involved enough that those veterans who want to go more in-dpeth will also get a lot out of it! Plenty of mods avaiable to suit you play style, but even stock, this game is a really good effort! Can't wait to see how the finished product will look!
