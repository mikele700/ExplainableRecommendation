Very fun game - I garantee you'll have alot of fun with this game only problem is you have to do a fix if the game is not working for you. The fix can be found here; http://steamcommunity.com/app/22370/discussions/0/828937546147175081/
If you like giant worlds, choas, competition then Just Cause 2 and Just Cause 2 Multiplayer is for you!
