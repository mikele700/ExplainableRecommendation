Time to start... What do I say?This is probably one of the best games ever made. It provides endless hours of gameplay that never ceases to change, when I first started off playing this I was a little slow at progressing, now ask anyone I play with and they say that I'm still pretty slow ;)There is always people playing and as there is in any game, the hardcore group of players dedicated to winning.With 2 huge expansions to the game it just adds to the diversity that this game already had. Adding more and more fun and challenge each way.I would, have and will again reccomend this game to all my friends and to ANYONE I MEET!It also provides a thrilling singleplayer that is preety much Multiplayer but with rationally thinking peopleI give this game a 9.5/10Only because it can be a little stressful on less powerful machines.But I've seen it play relativley well on a Lenovo iX30 Which has an i3 Intel so Thats preety good in itself
This game is one of those games that is fun mature and able for most age's. It will hopefully be one of the best for a long time coming!
Best game ever so engrossed in it :D
