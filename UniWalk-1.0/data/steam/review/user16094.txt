Distance is a wonderful racing game.  The second game by the developers following Nitronic Rush.  This game is amazing in so many ways.  From the high speeds you can reach, to the tricks and stunts you can perform and the different game modes.  There is an incredibly detailed and awesome level editor, while the TrackMania series has the title for level editors, this game definetely is up there, with the ability to change light and colour of track pieces and the amount of scenery objects that can be placed.  When I play this game, I am constantly being remminded of Trackmania and how the cars felt when climbing up steep ramps and walls.  This game takes it further by adding in a jump feature allowing for some awesome manoeuvring over gaps and jumping from wall to wall like a car ninja.  For an early access, this is definetely something amazing.  We can all expect that this wil continue to get better with each update.  This is a game I would easily reccommend if they liked the TrackMania series cause they would almost feel right at home.  While anyone who has a fancy would enjoy it, TrackMania players would probably start off better.
I have played this game for an extensive amount of hours. To make things clear now, just because I played it for a long time, doesn-'t mean I enjoyed the experience of it very much. First off as to why it-'s a poor quality game, is the obvious port problems. They have released many patches and updates trying to fix this but with each one they just bring in more problems that make the game even worse. I will say they have made the frame rate stable (for me at least) and they have fixed almost all the game crashing bugs (can-'t say the same about Arkham Origins). The story in this game, honestly wasn-'t very enjoyable. There were some plot twists that did throw the story around in a few directions but none of them ever lasted. The reveals and deaths weren-'t too effective, and many parts of the story that should have been important (including the Arkham Knight reveal) was basically shoved in your face the whole story leading up to it. Gameplay: Well it-'s terrible in most parts.Pros-The gliding and the overall look of the city is really nice and well done.          The graple controls are nice including the upgrade.          The upgrade system was clear and easy to understandCons-The feel of everything else was just awful. (This is going to be long)You could haer on the police radio that there is a riot taking place in an area nearby, so you can see with detecive vision that there is about 50 or so thugs just smashing stores and trashing the area, so you want to be a cool Batman and jump down and bash all those criminals up. BUT YOU CAN-'T! They all run away except for about 5. It is so sad just watching as everyone runs away and you aggrivate them at all to get their attention so they can turn around and join the fight. Even Arkham Origins did this better with the Crime in Progress system where you can have everyone in the big fights try and kill which was about 20-30 or so thugs. So why not in this game? I want to test my skills against a big group of thugs. Another thing is the Batmobile, I was so excited to hear that you can drive the Batmobile, however when they first showed the design, it was extremely dissapointing, especially the look. The back of it is horrible, it looks like a bug from some angles which is awful. The feel of it is terrible too. Don-'t think I-'m a bad driver because I am quite high in almost every single race event in this game, however it is just awful to drive. The race mechanics are just outright messed up. -Drifting slows down the timer to make one second in the timer last 3 in the real world-. That is just awful because it means that people don-'t get rewarded for being really fast and driving at high speeds. You will get a better reward (and faster time) for driving really slowly and drifting than you would by doing tight turns and driving at high speeds (and the difference can be up to 1 minute depending on your style). Another thing about driving is the physics. There are many physics problems in this. You can touch a wall which you will normally smash right through any normal time, but far to often, you will be sent flying doing flips in the sky. Ridiculous. And I haven-'t even gotten to the part where they over use the Batmobile so much. *spoilers* they destroy the Batmobile at one stage against a stupid drill machine which is almost faster than the Batmobile itself, and then less than 5 minutes later they give you another one. They can-'t keep it away from you. *end spoilers* They use it for everything. And every puzzle and trap possible just so happens to be only activated by the Batmobile! I will say that the combat challenges in the Batmobile are alright. Not good but alright. They are mostly easy and get very simple very quick. I don-'t put much more than 3 minutes of effort into it because that-'s as much variety as there is and it-'s not worth getting high on the leaderboard. Now moving onto combat. Oh boy, oh boy. This is the biggest problem in this game by a long shot. I can spend hours and hours talking about everything wrong with it, but I wont because I-'ve been making youtube videos to do that for me. The combat is awful and broken and just down right disapointing. I will start with the normal problems that need to be modified (this is excluding glitches). 1. Charging thugs: This was a stupid idea. A thug that runs at incredibly slow speed can only be stopped by a batarang to the face. (Or evade which doesn-'t stop them but avoids them). For some reason a flying kick from Batman to the face is beaten by a man doing a bit more than a jog. It-'s incredibly odd and stupid, and their hit box is far to big. They have a hit box of about 2 thugs wide.2. Camera in combat: It is the worst of the series. It will pan around for stupid reasons even when you don-'t want it to, and the problem with that is that the combat priotisation is based on your camera direction. Also a move you can unlock and perform is the Special Batclaw slam which grapples the target and you fly at him and flip over you and slam him into the ground. (A bit different when doing this to a Brute but the same problem is there) The camera does this stupid movie action look where it zooms in on their torso-'s and you can-'t see a damn thing. Sometimes there is a glitch where that camera shot doesn-'t work and it stays at the distant 3rd person look (and you know you messed up when a glitch makes what you have look sh*t). They need to get rid of the zoom on that move. It cause everyone to step back but it spins the camera as well messing things up for about .75 of a second (and that-'s important). Also the camera doesn-'t do well when near a wall (it might be a glitch so I-'ll explain it in that part). 3. Target Priorisation: This is one of the worst. They have many challenge maps in this game such as the combo master which means you need to keep one combo for as long as possible. I am not bad at Arkham Combat, I-'ve gotten hundreds of thousands of points (millions for some) in challenge maps and I-'ve gotten a nice score in combo master of over 250. Which was good for the first 3 days when it came out and the frame rates absolutely murdered itself when the timer starts on the screen and the frames drop to 1 per second. But now it-'s terrible. Keeping combos for more than 200 is almost impossible. Special moves such as disarm and destroy don-'t know what they are doing. They need a proper order of importance beacuse for some reason, the game seems to think that poles and baseball bats are more of a threat than stun sticks or shields. (Even though baseball bats and poles are weapons Batman can use) Basic Free flow combat has got it wrong also. I can look straight at a thug without anything in his hand, I aim at him, I go for him, but the game decides that the man 3 thugs behind him with a stun stick is the right target to pick which kills the combo and fails the challenge. It-'s just terrible. In one of the videos I-'m making, I will be including a full length statement including how priotisation and the combat should be working to make things good again. There is more but I will move onto the glitches.Camera against walls: Combo challenge is a perfect example. There isn-'t a proper boundary in that challenge, it just some purple walls that fizzle which used to murder frame rates right? Well for some reason the camera glitches like crazy when you try and look behind you when punching someone against those walls. Those walls need to let the camera go through them at least cause it messes so much up. Counters: They are broken as hell. I get so many instances where a thug wants to attack so me so I counter, but they just freeze and don-'t attack and Batman doesn-'t move so it drops the combo. You can-'t do anything but watch for one second as nothing happens and watch your chance of getting a high score vanish. These need to fixed because they cause extreme game impacting problems. I have run out of room for this review. Don-'t buy. 
Sanctum 2 is one really the only FPS/Tower Defence Game.  No game has dones something like this before and had the risk of majorly failing.  Coffee Stains studios did extremely well in their game.  They've put so much detail into every map and enemy.  Coming from their first Sanctum, they really kept it up.  Even though there are big changes, it will still feel like the first one.  Both games rely heavily on your strategies.  There are multiple ways to beat the level but there are always those setups that beat every other.  I have to say, Co-op is where this really gets the fame and attention it has.  Playing a normal Tower Defence, you are by yourself, just watching things happen.  Sanctum solo makes you feel pretty awesome as you are taking down waves after waves.  But when the co-op starts, things get much better.  You and your friends will be jumping all over the map blasting enemies to pieces and having a great time.  I have played a lot more solo than I have co-op but I definetely like Co-op more.  You get more people to with resources to build your towers, two extra guns and 3 perks to switch with.  The choice of perks and weapons and towers are very important.  You don't want to take an Anti-Air tower into a map with no flying units (that's a wasted tower), and you don't want a perk that gives you speed increase if it's a map where you don't even need to run and you can stay still the whole time.  There are perks and weapons for almost every kind of play style, from cover sniper, to rocket launcher madman and your classic assault.  Downsides: Difficulty is random as the story continues.  And I don't mean if you do well on one level it suddenly gets hard.  I mean that you can be going through easy levels, then the next 2 are extremely hard and it gives no warning, suddenly gets hard then drops back down.  It will cause frustration but there is a restart button if you get stuck.  Lag:  I know this isn't the game's fault but if you are playing with someone and one of you has lag or gets a random lag spike, it really downs the game and makes it impossible to play properly.  If lag is an issue for you, stay away from Co-opTroll weapons:  I'm serious, there are some weapons in the game that look like they have been made for trolling other players.  They have serious knockback and will p*ss people off a lot.  It sends the person being shot flying and knocking them off the map in the middle of a big fight.  This is one of my favourite games because it's just works brilliantly in so many ways.  There are more things I should talk about such as how great the game looks and the little minigames featured, but I won't.  That's for you to experience.
This game is just pure awesome.  One of the best MMOFPS games you will found out there.  The moment you land on the battlefield you already get excited and are eager to get into the action.  The wide variety of weapons is great with Heavy class carrying SAWS and Battle Rilfes to the Medic carrying around a deadly SMG.  Not only is it just a land game but you can fly in different ships and carry team mates from one place to another.  Land vechiles are extreme and the team with good aim and good weapons is sure to come out on top.  the battles can get very hectic.  Even small battles like 5 v 5 in a small area can get hard and challenging.  Defence and offence.  this game has it.  I hope this was good and I look forward to seeing you on the Planetside.  get shooting everyone!
