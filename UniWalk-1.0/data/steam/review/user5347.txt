AMAZING GAME! fantastic story and a very nice active open world to explore. I would defenatly advise anyone that has not bought this game to do so right now!
GTA 4 but chineese, and what i say by that is very true. Very good game and i will defenatly poor some more hours into this game especially after completing the main story. Many, many side missions and objectives to do and is a great game for anyone that would in like GTA 4.
Very good game, but unfortunatly at the moment while the game is in alpha some code and aspects of the game need to be fixed to then make a tremendous game. Also do not go into this game being someone that wants their loot for ever, this is not the game for you!
