Game is so bad you wouldn't have a clue what's going on....I recommend getting a real CS game like CS Source or Global Offensive
I invested over 95 hours (20-30 hrs probably leaving on the launcher) in this game and I must say I enjoy it alot.Ever since the recently (December) Unstable update they have added and improve the game.I will say I had no hope when no updates were showing up, but when the unstable update showed up I played it for longer periods of time and i must say, the game is fun.Also Flying Paper Airplane 10/10
just a prank, social experimentz. THE CAMERA IS JUST BEHIND YOU BRO IT'S JUST A PRANK!
Been playing this since it was released on some website for testing, I must say, it's worth every single dollar i put into it.
You're all doing bad at your job...BUT if you were bad I wouldn't be playing this game right nowSo you're doing a great jobJust pls somehow make it so that the game can just run on low end systems, not everyone has access to 2000$ gaming rigs.Game is great, I can't wait for more content
