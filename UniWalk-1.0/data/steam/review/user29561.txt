Awesome game, fun, but also very harsh on the newer players. Needs updating!
I love this game more than Peanut Butter and Nutella toasted sandwhiches,420/420 Would love more than Peanut Butter and Nutella toasted sandwhiches againNo seriously though, Buy this game! I have had 15 dollars of fun in my 1.3 hours of playtime, What can that say for the future? A lot! So just give it a go, and yeah I know there are a few bugs but hey its a new game, and it can only get better, so get behind the developers and boost them so they can make this game the best survival game out there!
When greenlight ♥♥♥♥s up, the guy manufacturing all these horrible games should be shot
Awesome Game!Trading Is Awesome!Gameplay Is Awesome!Community Is Not So Awesome D: (12 year olds all day)Items Are Awesome10/10, Would Hoard Hats Again.
Now don't get me wrong, I love this game, I have spent a good few days on it and i have come to love it, thats why this review is positive, but why, does this game from back in 2009 or whatever still crash when loading locations / saves even though my computer is a beast, like seriously, i have literally had to restart the game upwards of 50 times at this point for that very damn reason, also the v.a.t.s system is bugged as ♥♥♥♥, you will target something and your character will just start walking back slowly while getting pummeled by whatever your aiming at and then it exits v.a.t.s like nothing ever happened, good job on the ♥♥♥♥ing coding ♥♥♥♥ nuts. Otherwise this game is fantastic, if all these bugs were fixed and the game be left as it is in all other aspects, I would literally, like ♥♥♥♥ in my pants, but for now, that aint happening, Developers, Why u do dis ;-;
My god, This game, This game ladies and gentleman, is the definition of Gamer ♥♥♥♥♥♥420/10 Would Blaze Again
Fun and exctiting, Except it is hard to pick up the concept.
An awesome game with a great story, And not unlike any serious sam game you know that when you see 1 enemy there is gonna be another 100 of em just over the next hill, Completely Awesome :)
