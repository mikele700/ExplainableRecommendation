I had just played it and it seems quite fun, but i have missing textures and it is quite frustrating. Everything is pink, PINK!!! But i really do hope you guys can somehow patch this up and i would re-install but, that would take forever when you have 245kbps download (Peak.) *sigh* but, nice game.
I like this bette than -Dungeons and Dragons- because there is more better quests and more action. The last game (my opinion) was just plain boring, but these 4  -Dungeons and Dragons- fans did a FANTASTIC job on making the combat more fun in all the ways.
