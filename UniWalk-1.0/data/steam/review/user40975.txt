What with our Introduction of the Ebola virus into America now, this game is lifelike, AnD a good intoduction into bioethics, and Virology, its almost an ANTI- Cicilization, build up your Vacterium or Virus and then DESTROY humanity.. only thing missing would be allowing us to rebuild another new species, and they kinda brought that in with the Planet of the aopes Crossover. its surprisingly easy to pla, and yet ver addictive, its cheap, and actually pretty good.  3 Stars.
