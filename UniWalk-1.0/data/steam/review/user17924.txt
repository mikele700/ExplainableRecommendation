Masterpiece, beautiful and game of the decade. Glorious in all senses despite its age, fantastic story.33/10
In terms of competitive FPS CS:GO is the best, while also providing a great experience to the casual audience. I would currently recommend it over any other FPS even if the person is looking for a casual and fun. 9/10
