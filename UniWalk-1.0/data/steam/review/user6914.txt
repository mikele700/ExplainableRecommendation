This game. This game. This game has brought numerous gamers countless hours of fun and procrastination. This game may not bring much to the table in terms of gameplay, and it may come across as a childish, and perhaps overrated game. And maybe, just maybe, you-'re right. But let me tell you what has been told a million times before: This game is ridiculously fun.Seriously, no money to hand over, no advertisements, and you start with a fair bit for a F2P game. This is singlehandedly the best multiplayer game I have ever played. From it-'s ever expanding community, do it-'s deep roots with the past, to it-'s ever changing gameplay, this game is AMAZING. Not only that, but the openness of the game must truely push the Source engine to the limit.I-'m going to stop ranting now. Do you have 15-ish GB of internet to spare on a game that will stay alive for years to come? You do? Then get the game.All those pictures of Spycrabs and rapping demomen will make so much more sense when you actually start playing.EDIT: I have just gone through the negative section and 90% of the negative posts go something along these lines: TF2 has hats. Hats=ruined game. Seriously, if you don-'t like trading, are tired of getting scammed, think the trading community is bad, then guess what? DON-'T TRADE. Hats aren-'t an integral part of TF2. I-'ve met many good players who wear gibus-' for the sake of getting surprise kills. There are three types of people who play TF2: The players, the traders, and the MVMers. Please, invest in them all. It-'s a good -learning experience.- Heck, when you become and experienced player, you can help other new players. But please, if you do find a reason good enough to drop the game, comment it below. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR IT :3
