Really Fun Game, If You Like Stratergy/Team Games Then This Game Is For You, You Have A Variety Of 50+ ''Heros'' To Play, Some Are Harder Than Others To Master Yet Other Have here Pick On Whats Easy And What Not, Its A Really Fun Game, A Match Goes On For Around 30 Mins To An Hour It Can Get Really Addictive And Its Really Fun. I Recommend It, If You Like Stratergy And Games Where The Best Skill Is Teamwork
