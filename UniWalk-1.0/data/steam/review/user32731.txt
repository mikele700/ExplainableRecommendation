I liked it and I hope it goes somewhere
Your game is epic.
Caster is an unchallenged masterpieced with next generation graphics (for 1980). It's enticing story line and playtime is rivalled only by the intense cliffhanger and the tension of what is to become to the protagonist in the much anticipated sequel. 10/10 would buy this game (for 0.14).
I'm pretty sure I bought this after getting a 90% off coupon from making a gmod badge. I had a go at it and from what I've found is that it's an ok game for players un-familiar to horror games but not as entertaining for the fans of the genre. I found the game mechanics good and easy to operate and familiarise myself with but ultimately the game lacked in content you could get yourself sucked into and didn't give you the chance to connect to the character Walden mainly due to the lack of voice acting. While I may not think Walden and the Werewolf is one of the best games when it comes to an original story I do think the creators have something going for them and I deffinetly would buy the game again to support them in the hope of future games... For 10 cents anyway.
I remember getting this ages ago. Its pretty good for a couple hours or so but afterwards gets a little to repeititive. It has good animation and sound effects but lacks the content for too many hours of gameplay. It is still worth it as it keeps me coming back for a few minutes ever once and a while.
I was a little sketchy about it at first but after a while,  and after I learnt the basics of the game mechanics and features, I found myself spending so many hours enjoying the game! While it is a free to play game, if I were you, I would deffinetely put that extra five dollars into the game for the premium, the game creators deserve the help! If you havn't, get the game and try it out, it's not like you've got anything to lose!
