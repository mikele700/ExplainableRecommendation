This game has got to be my favourite game ever. For some reason, this games story just really clicks with me. I honestly don-'t know why, but it just does. Everytime I finsh this game (almost my 6th playthrough), I always feel for Simon, I feel his pain and it almost makes me... how do you say it on the internet? Oh yes, -cri erry tiem.- The way the monsters tie together with Simon as a character, for example; Carcass representing Simons shattered heart regarding Sophie, or the Taller, representing the fact that Simon is in a wheelchair and everyone else is taller. Every monster has its place.Even if you-'re not a fan of horror games, I highly recommend you give this game a try. I mean its free, what can you lose? I-'ve put about 40-50 hours into this game (that includes the original Half Life mod) and I-'m still chipping away at the unlockables.PS: 26 16 4 27 49 2 32 45 12 23, remember those numbers
