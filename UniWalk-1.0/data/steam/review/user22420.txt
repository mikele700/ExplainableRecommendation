After Playing about liturally 6 minutes of the game I INSTANTLY UnInstalled the game. I Will NEVER play it again and hope that you never will.
How have i not yet recommended this, GET IT
YES YES YES YES YESLYNE IS LOVELYNE IS LIFEThis game, is cheap (i got it 75% off when i crafted a badge, but it is already cheap)Its simple, and gets addicting fast.With its level groups A-Z, each containing around 25 puzzles each(fogot exact), and daily puzzles coming out, uh, daily.You won't run out.Finishing a level gives a boost of dopamine into my brain.
