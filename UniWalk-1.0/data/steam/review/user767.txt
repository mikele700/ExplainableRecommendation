After the revolver update the game become so unbalanced,seems that the devs of the game don`t give a damn about the community ,changing the gameplay to be more like COD type where u can shoot a full clip of ak47 and dont give a damn about the recoil of the weapon .. u gotta love VOLVO <3<3 for all the hard working they`ve done to maintain the game balanced*sarcasm alert*..Let`s not forget about the previous update where they introduced the new in-game sounds and m4a1-s nerf.I hope they will realise the mistakes they`ve made and rebalance the game as soon as possible.♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥ Volvo
