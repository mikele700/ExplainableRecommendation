*HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*This is one of the best Strategy Action Simulators i have played since ArmA II.Looks beautiful if you have top range PC.One Downside is that it is highly intensive on your CPU and I cannot recommend this for low end computers/laptops.You never run out of things to do, due to the Steam Workshop and Level Editor where mahy people create great game types and areas for combat.I give a 9/10
Awesome Game. Buy it now if you can accept that things aren't going to be perfect. If not i suggest waiting until the full release.
Great Game to play with friends, whether its creation or just outright murder. A good laugh and definetly recommend buying.
