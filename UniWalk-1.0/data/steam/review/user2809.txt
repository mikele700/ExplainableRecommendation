Honestly GMOD is one of the best games i have ever played for one reason and one alone.YOU.CAN.MESS.AROUND.DOING.WHATEVER.YOU.WANT.
Well it has to be a game that I am more interested in than others because I happen to be a FANattic of WWII.
Shoot Zambiez, Buy Gunz, Shoot More Zambiez, Buy More Gunz. Very Repetitive yet Addictive.
