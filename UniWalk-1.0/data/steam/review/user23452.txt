Yep, great game. I reccommend this to everyone who enjoys tactical games. This game provides gameplay that you can't get from other total war games. The game itself has endless things you can do I promise you won't get bored. The one downside to this game that dissapointed me was the sea battles. The sea battles are boring and really hard and complicated to understand otherwise apart from that the game has generally all of the qualities you want in game. Also great cinematics.
