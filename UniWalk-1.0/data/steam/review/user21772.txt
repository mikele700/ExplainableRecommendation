Needed a proper single player
Its ♥♥♥♥ Nuff Said
Take Moscow In WInter 10/10
I played this game for a while and i thought when i switched to PC that i would-'t have to deal with this Year one redone ♥♥♥♥. So it is disappointing that they (Undead Labs)  only offer a 33% discount and not a full upgrade to those of Us who payed for this version expecting to be valued as a community and to see Undead Labs. Releasing basically a graphical update and calling it a -Year One- version of this game is the wrong direction for this Studio.
