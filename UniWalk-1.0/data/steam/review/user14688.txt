This is a very well constructed game that unfolds like a good book. Which is probably a good analogy, as the game would be best appreciated by those who enjoy reading books - if you find you don-'t have the patience for books then you won-'t enjoy this game and that probably explains some of the negative reviews.All that said, I picked the game up for $5 in the Summer Sale, and that is a fair price - I would have felt ripped off if I-'d paid full price ($20) for the less-than 2 hours it took to finish the game.Saying too much about the story that unfolds would quickly lead to spoiler alerts, but suffice to say the writers have done an excellent job of layering emotional, sinister, and mystery storylines. There are times when the game guides you too obviously - many of the notes left for you to find are just too unrealistic and a just pushing you in the direction to go. Most -puzzles- have only one solution, so judged purely on game mechanics it-'s pretty basic. But as an interactive story, with a well thought out environment it-'s great.Just don-'t pay retail.
