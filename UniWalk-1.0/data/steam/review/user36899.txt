AWESOME
 Flawless game, what flawless game? nah but honestly this is an amazing game. You go around fighting robots cutting off stormtroopers arms and whatnot. I really love the way you can force grip someone and fling them across the map or guide them into other enemys.This might just be my computer but the sky goes all weird and reminds me of when you don't have the right addons for gmod and the sky reflects what you look at on the ground. Does that make sense?The plot is alright, Darth Vaders apprentice takes down the rest of the jedi's and teams up with Vader to plot against the Emperor. Or is Vader using his apprentice?
