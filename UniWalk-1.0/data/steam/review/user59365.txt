this game, omg wow. It's so god damn awesome. The artwork is stunningly beautiful, i could look at it forever. The music is amazing as well. If i have the sound track i would listen to it and it would never get old. The gameplay is just superb. The use of both strategy and bruteforce keeps you on your toes the whole time. It's balanced and unique and the abilities (or functions as they are called) are fun and easy to use. And they can even use those functions to upgrade other functions as well as being passive buffs for yourself which i also found unique. And on top of all that the story was just so awesome. It was so wonderfully written and even with small voice acting, it was done well. Overall, this game is a masterpiece for me, 10/10
