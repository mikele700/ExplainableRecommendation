Even though the game is only in alpha, DayZ Standalone proves to be fun, nerve racking and beautiful. I do admit the game does take a bit of getting used to, and the first few hours of the game can really deter a new comer to the game from playing again. But once you properly get into the game and have some supplies, that is where the true excitement of the game is found. The survival aspect of the game is already very detailed with you needing to eat food, drink water, bandage wounds, apply splints to broken legs, finding food and water, the list goes on and from looking at the DayZ Arma II mod, there will be a lot more things implemented into the game making it a lot more harder to survive. I highly recommend this to players looking for a survival game that isn’t mission based and gives you complete freedom to do whatever you want. I’m very excited to see what direction the game goes in over the coming months.
