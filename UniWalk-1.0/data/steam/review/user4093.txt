This Game is a really good game to show not only how a good free to play game should be made, but also how a good first person shooter should be made. This game has very enjoyable, fast paced gameplay and lots of humor. the only downside in my opinion to this game is that it is hard to find a game at times because not a lot of people play it. Some days you can find a game in seconds, and some days it can be impossible to find a game. The only game mode that is really played is Team Deathmatch but sometimes you can find other modes. The game also includes a very fun and most importantly challenging challenge mode which can also be fun to play. To anyone reading this review i strongly urge you all to play this game!
even though it has quite a long download time it is still has great gameplay, good graphics and gameplay that makes you wantto come back for more.
