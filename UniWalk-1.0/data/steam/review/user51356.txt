Pros:-Colourful and vibrant levels and environments-Lots of fun and unique weapons-Funny and interesting characters-Engaging story-Decent enemy varietyCons:-The drop rates leave a lot to be desired-Scaling, especially in UVHM, is bad, forcing you to look for gear every 2 levels-Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM) could have been handled better-Did I mention that drop rates sucked? I mean really sucks.Overall, I highly recommend playing BL2. It's a ton of fun and you will not regret the purchase.If possible get the GOTY edition which gives you the 4 major campaign DLCs, 2 new player characters (which are both awesome) and UVHM 1. And I highly recommend getting the Digistruct Peak DLC which bumps up the difficulty a lot (if you found UVHM to be too easy). While UVHM has its flaws, it is still fun once you get the hang of it.
