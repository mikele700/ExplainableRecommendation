I've played the game for over 4 years now, i didn't start on this account but ive been loyal to this game since 2012. I may not be the best player but i personally think this game is amazing as it helps me let off steam and stress in real life by killing some monsters, It has been needing new owners and i think Deca were perfect for it. I hope they do successfully with the game, i wont be quitting anytime soon! IGN: XXlegionHD
