This game is just perfect, it takes a lot of effort to start out :) but with friends its angelic :D
Nicely Crafted, lots of moddability, interesting game world, interesting characters. An all around fun game.As soon as the Creation Kit is released for this game, i shall give it my body.For now it just has my time.8/10
I've owned the game for 2 weeks.......The missing person's unit has stopped looking for me at this point.Oh well, just one more night, or one more season.....Help.
This game is what my nightmares look like, it's a wonderful game, but seriously, i cant get very far in cos i ♥♥♥♥ my pants and build a fort to hide in for a few days after, 10/10 will complete and uninstall and cry, lots
