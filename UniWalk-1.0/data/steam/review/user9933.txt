Hands down the best game I have ever played. This game reminded me why I play games, and I cannot recommend this more. Beautiful graphics and extremely in-depth storyline, both the high flying Columbia and the deep down Rapture (from the burial at sea dlc's), create a very real, very compelling environment.
