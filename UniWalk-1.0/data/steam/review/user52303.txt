Do you like survival games? If so you'll love the Forest, easily one of the best survival games on market, if not one of the best survival games ever made (just my opinion). If you have the money buy The Forest, if not blow and get the money, very worth it. 9.7/10 near prefect
Just a really fun time watser, if you don't have tons of free time and/or aren't a huge city simulator kind of gamer wait for a sale on this game. 7/10 something a bit different and a lot of fun
So much fun
Dayz is awesome game don't get me wrong.But 80% of the people that play it are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.There are no real glitchs or game breaking bugs that I have seen so far.I would however like to see some sort of karma system put in place that stops or atleast makes people think twice about killing people just for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.
