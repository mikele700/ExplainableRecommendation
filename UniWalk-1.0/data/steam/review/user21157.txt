(sorry for my english, it's not my first language) pros:-Good variety with parts, you can paint every part differently, and choose the weapons, chassis and ways of locomotion.-Great fun game, where you can control a tank and laugh as your target falls into the water and explodes, or snipe your target for afar, or even get a flamethrower and destroy him up close and personal.-Good level up, where you get your new upgrades after killing the professionals, wich is very rewarding.cons:-few people playing (but you can fix that by playing)-the aim is not very accurate at the moment... (the next update will fix that)-few levels and gamemodes (but this should not be a problem for very long)So in general, it may have some problems, but it's quite fun and I think more people should give it a try.
