It's like DayZ+ Minecraft and really awsome, and FREE
Best and most random Fighter ever
Awsome game but random and even better with friends It's like a 3D version of net hack.
It' Is a great 2D stealth, Haking game
It's like Terraria and Star Wars had a baby.
It's like GTA's disoned little brother that tries to make up for it with commedy.
Great game emotion wise but lacks in game play and I don't think the excellent feel of the game makes up for that.
A nice and well desinged game, which in it's current state (of review) feels like it is missing things.It is still well presented and has no bugs I have yet in countered, and handles hackers well.Is definitly worth downloading.
Awsome it's like all my favourite mech show in a Game! :0
