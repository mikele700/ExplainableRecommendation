One of the best free to play games that I had ever seen, played and traded on. Good job valve. Keep it up!
Bought this game after finishing poker night at the inventory. I must say that this one is quite harder than I thought, which makes it even more challenging. Another great job by Telltale Games.  9.3/10
I must say this is one of the best movie sequal games that I have ever played before as it reveals a new story to connect with the 3 back to the future movies! Great job telltale games!
A game perfect for those expricenced with the first person shooter world and love robbing banks with their best friends. 9.3/10
Got this game with the deal of it combined with Grand Theft Auto IV. The game seems to be very good gameplay and all, but there have been alot of errors for me such as the mouse not operating. If Rockstar games could fix that error it would get better reviews and more people to buy it.
Before I bought this game I was very new to playing poker, but thanks to the tutorials in this one I learnt how to play it in 4 hours. I was also influenced by how could win items for Team Fortress 2. Really gets peoples attention into playing it. 9.2/10 . Keep doing what your doing telltale games!
Great game, great gameplay, great storyline, great system with choosing how you play the game and whats going to happen next. 9/10. Nice job telltale games!
Not such a bad game. It was convienient to purchase it with the San Andreas deal. Great job matching 2 games in 1 deal steam! Keep it up!
I remember playing this game many years ago on a very old laptop and I enjoyed every bit of it in the campaign, multiplayer and much more. I'm really glad to see that this game hasnt been abandoned as it really is a true Mythology game. I recommend this to all players who enjoy historical open world sandboxes.
One of the best zombie survival simulators I've played9/10
