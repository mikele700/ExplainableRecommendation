fans of horror and fnaf will love this game. Obviously though, it is a little 2 spooky 4 me.Highly recommended to people who are interested in horror.
I've only played a sliver of XCOM: Ayylmao unknown.And holy ♥♥♥♥, it is some top teir ♥♥♥♥!Ayy LMAO takes what makes turn based good, and makes it brilliant. Which is pretty incredibly because I hate turnbased!I can't recommend this game enough!
Like all games Ziggurat has its problems, these are at the core, the fact that levels in and of themselves aren't the most well designed things, and that the music isn't really that great.But the problems are overshadowed by what this game does right.This game perfectly brings the concept of a roguelite to the first person shooter genre, having some of the best visuals and gameplays out there, all of this is done in a dark comedic and cartoonish way that will have you constantly switching weapons, sprinting, jumping and varying between fire modes constantly. Atop this it manages to massively improve on roguelite concepts by giving you choices in character leveling by letting you choose between a pair of random perks with each level. While the game contains perma death, each time you die or progress further you will unlock new equipment.Overall this is hands down the greatest game to reach an official release this year, being almost glitch free and containing mountains of content, it is an absolute MUST PLAY for ANY rogue-lite, RPG or FPS fan. The devs are so confident you will love it, they simply show gameplay for the trailers, if that isn't product confidence, I don't know what is.
