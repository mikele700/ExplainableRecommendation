Guys you don't understand just how dead it makes you feel inside when your favourite soldier gets ♥♥♥♥ing blasted by a sectoid and there's nothing you can do. 10/10
Ok if you're willing to suffer through 30fps, windows life ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, terrible optimization, having to play with a controller and occcasional texture fading and screen tearing it's a really fun and highly challenging game, it's bloody difficult but my god does it take long to actually get to the playing the game part, not recommended for people that can't suffer through terrible pc ports
