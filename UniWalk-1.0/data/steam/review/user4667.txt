Now this I can fap too.
If you don't have this game, you may be mentally challenged. If you aren't, buy it now.
Has a really nice feel to it. I'm not really an anime watcher/player but the graphics feel nice and I'm enjoying it so far.
It's bootyful.Made by a 16 year old and better than alot of games made by big companies.
It's practically free WoW but with a smaller community.
Great strategy game, fun for hours on end, community is great except for when you find scrubs who just lynch with no evidence, even when they are town.
Good little time waster, good to play when waiting for a download or something for a short period of time.
