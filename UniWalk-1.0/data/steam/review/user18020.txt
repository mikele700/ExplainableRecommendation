Perhaps the best indie game I've played to date. The Binding of Isaac is such an addictive game. One of the reasons why it is so addictive is with every initiation of the game, it is randomised, and therefore remains refreshing on every playthrough. It's good that its like this, since there's a long progression path to unlocking everything and unlocking platinum god. This game is a must have. 9.5/10
Mythical beasts, out to dominate.Sneak as I may, I stalk my prey.Guns and bows blazing, a shooting fray.Warriors rage, war starts today.The possibilities in Dota stretch far and beyond. An extremely addictive RTS MOBA, it strikes a nerve in your competitive side to keep playing. And you should.
Months after release and it still has issues. Just don't even dare getting this.
A very immersive experience indeed. The graphics and art style is blooming, gameplay mechanics are a classic with the bioshock distinctive feel, and a story filled with so many ideas and concepts its leaves you with a lot to think. Great game. 8.5/10
