This is an amazing game to play with friends, but if you dont have any friends who play this then thats completely fine! There are plenty of side quests to keep you going and im still trying to find all the treasure from the 'Dig-A-Hole' shop. This is a very funny game, and if you like other games like legend of zelda or final fantasy then you should definitely get this game!p.s. you can get a laser sword
