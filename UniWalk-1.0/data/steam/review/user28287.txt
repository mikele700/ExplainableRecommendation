This game kept bugging me to review but since this is the last time I'll be playing, that's fine with me.On June 20th, 2016 at roughly 3am I will hijack a QANTAS plane departing Perth Airport for Bali, Indonesia. I will smuggle in a 3D printed pistol I had disassembled, placed in a bag and had swallowed earlier to prevent detection. Roughly 20 minutes into takeoff I will enter the in-flight bathroom, produce the bag from my stomach, assemble it, and exit the bathroom. I will then enter the cockpit and place the pistol against the head of the pilot. If the pilots are uncooperative or any person attempts to disarm me, I will shoot the pilots and attempt to take control of the plane myself, if this is impossible I will quickly pull down on the joystick, plunging everyone onboard to their deaths. However, if the pilots do cooperate, or I am able to take control of the plane, we will fly directly to a predetermined secret location in the Philippines where my group will take all remaining passengers hostage. After this a video of demands will be posted onto Facebook, Youtube, Vimeo and Dailymotion through multiple accounts. If our demands are not met within 48 hours, 10 passengers will be executed and a video of their executions posted onlines. Every hour after this will result in another 10 passengers being executed until the demands are met.The game suffers from stuttering issues and a few minor bugs but aside from that, it's quite fun.
