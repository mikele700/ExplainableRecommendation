I tried to play many other MOBA's - tried to get into them and understand what the hype was - to no avail. When I read about this game being a 3rd person with more control over the way you attack I was willing to give it a go. I was highly surprised and now I'm highly addicted to this game. Sometimes when you take a different approach you get it right, and you account for those of us like me, who didn't like the original way it was done.
This game is amazing. You need it. It's weapons and tech are incredibly unique and the immersion is fantastic. If they add multiplayer it will become 10/10, right now for me it's at 9/10.Graphics 8/10 Exploration 10/10Crafting 10/10Soundscape 10/10This is Early access I hope it actually makes a real release and doesn't get left behind.
