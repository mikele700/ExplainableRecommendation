Amazing visuals and a new experience to the roguelike genre.I haven't had too much time within the game, but from what I've played so far, I have found that it is an amazing example of what can be done within the Unity Game Engine. I also really enjoy the horror aspect with the combination of roguelike mechanics. Congrats to the developers on working on a new aspect to the roguelike genre, not often seen in a 3D environment.10/10 Would definitely recommend people give this a go!
Good for mindless ♥♥♥♥, practically mario cart on crack.
