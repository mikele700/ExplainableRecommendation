I think this is the best online RPG game I ever played so far!Things that makes it awesome;- Rifts,tears,footholds etc- Achievements/Titles- Beautiful and variety of landscapes- Group/Instant adventures- Skills (fishing, mining, survival etc.)The cons.In the store to buy stuff, some stuff can only be bough with -special currency- or those annoying credits where u have to pay real money for first it-'s a pity.
