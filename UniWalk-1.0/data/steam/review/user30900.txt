i thinks its a good game all round but it needs a better save system, im so Fuu**ing angry, i was at the bit when you get to the elevator after unlocking lockdown and seeing the alien for first time and then i was in the elevator when my game crashed, its stuff like this that i hate in games....... repetition
cool but HARD
this game is great, my only complaint is its impossible, there are bits in the game where you are level 17 to 19 and it throws really op level 21 enemies at you, im going to give this game a yes but i dont think im going to keep going with it because all it makes me do is get frustrated.
its brilliant
ITS GREATwish valve would make left 4 dead 3
