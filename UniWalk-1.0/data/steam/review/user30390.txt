Such a chilled game or a competitive one if you want to, rocket league is for everyone.
Will forever be in the top 10 games of all-time. Just awesome, and you can take the experiance even further with the workshop, adding custom textures and sounds to enchance the immersive experiance I got with this game.
Played this game since I was 7 years old and I never dropped it since. Fantastic RTS that is really consistant as shown with it's age. Great to see that it is still worked on and played by a great community.
