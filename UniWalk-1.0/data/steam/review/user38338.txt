♥♥♥♥♥ all over SimCity 2013. Cheaper. Plus (you might want to sit down for this), it works!Amazeballs.
Much better than Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken, buy/play this instead.
Fun. Challenging but not difficult. Just one more...
Would you like some gameplay with your cutscenes....Movie, then you run through a corridor, then another movie where everything interesting happens, then you run along another corridor & open a door to, another movie where all the action happens, then, well, rinse & repeat.Yawn.A graphic novel with some connect-the-dots 'player interaction'.
Fun. Replayable. Worth it.You may think you need to know more than that, but you don't really.There's plenty of tracks, they're well made, they're both challenging AND fun, there's plenty to achieve & find, and you will keep coming back to it time after time. Even when you're done with it you're still likely to want to have a play once in a while.There's wheel, chassis, engine upgrades, which obviously make the bike lighter, faster etc; but also change the handling of the bike. The controls are simple enough to jump straight into yet the maps & physics require mastery.If you beat your friends at any challenge your pic goes up on the in-game billboards so they all see it as they ride-by & fail. ;)I can't say whether it is better or worse than others in the series, but on it's own I can't find anything to complain about.It's worth the price & if on sale it's a no-brainer.
It's enjoyable enough, easy, not much/any challenge. You just kind of roll through it & the end is nigh.A kiddies' version of Mark of the Ninja, except the gushing blood, & adult themes of cut-scenes preclude children from playing it.Get Mark of the Ninja instead.
Pretty good.Remember to disable AA for big fps gain.
