its quite fun its like your making your own fighting scenes when you figre out what to do
This game is extreamly fun and i think mosts should get it. but the premium ruins the whole game becuase you level up faster, more robopoints, more tech points. so in later updates they should get rid of premium.
This game is very interesting i love it but it needs some bug fixes and items to spawn and a little less zombies (theres to many)
