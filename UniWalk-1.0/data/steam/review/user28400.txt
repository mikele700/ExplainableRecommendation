Beautiful game, well done, is the best description of this game, thoe that have played the first instalment of this flawless and well developed game, The Heist , will find that buy the scond instalment to be well worth it, much more to do, very diverse weaponry, a fun, and exciting criminal combat experience.  for those of you wondering,- Should i buy this game?-the answer is YES!!! You cannot go wrong witht his game, personally it is worth the money but fot those on the fence if my review hasn-'t coaxed you over the edge then perhaps you would perfer to wait till this game goes on sale as it frequently does and cease tht opportunity to further your PayDay experience. In Conclusion the game , as you can tell from its populrity, well made and without a doubt is worth having.
depicts the real survival aspect of humanity where people will kill eachother for their itmes repeatedly ,good game if you dont mind running about for most of the game getting items staying alive and being shot on sight by most then rinse and repeat,personally i find it eventfull and interesting to survive and meet/help players. recommend you play with friends (a large group)there is strengthy in numbers
i love it got it for free and cant complain just short of arma's realism one shot u die i like the realism play stlye and the ww2 war theme it is ,in my opinion worth 20 bucks so if u missed it go buy it if your looking for a good ww2 shooter.
awesome but ever changing not new player frienldy as most in game content is only avaidable to veteran players,such as mu self for thee are many crafting restrictions form mastery rank to getting resources (which can prove to be fustrating and difficult).its still a good game if your willing to put time and money into it.
get it
epic
