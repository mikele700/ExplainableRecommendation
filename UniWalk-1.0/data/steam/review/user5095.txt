Sonic Lost world previously a WII U and nintendo 3DS exclusive now ported on the computer i most say there is alot of good and bad things about this game 1 the level design is abosultly stunning 2 the voice acting is ok 3 its a good game (sorry for the terriable review)
it sucks the mod sucks
but it could support slower machine's with 1.0 ghz
