This game man this game...This game pulls at the heart-strings, making you want to right the depression that you are facing.I had picked the choices that were right to me, i wanted to see myself through this game without shedding a tear... and i didn't.I shed tears not when in the state of depression but seeing that my choices affected the mental instability that the character faced. 10/10I also adopted the kitten.
This game is amazing.Being able to play this game with my brother is money well spent in my opinion.The art style is unique and gameplay is fantastic!10/10
I  have been following this game through development and when i saw 'Steam Early Access' under the title I  bought the game and played it a lot
