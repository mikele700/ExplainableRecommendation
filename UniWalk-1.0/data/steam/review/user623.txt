Haha... Oh god where do I start? Well firstly I'd like to say, I have played more then steam reveals, that's for sure! Anyway, Garry's Mod The Craziest game on steam! Garry's Mod has SO much freedom! You can do anything you want and then do more with mods! The Game modes are AWESOME!!! I definitely suggest buying this game! It's infinite potential and stupidly hilarious community make a great game... GO! BUY IT!!(p.s. This is my first review it sucks, I'm sorry!)
