Its a very fun game that is fair priced specially if you like RTS. Has a fair unit diversity. GREAT controls an OK thou buggy modding community and I mean going against 10 people with the ability to blow up whole solar systems is just fun. On the other side the game has optimization issues sometimes destroying a planet leaves the units that ware on it witch is terrible for performance.But when it comes down to it your going to enjoy the game either way(specially if you have a good computer)EDIT:(A mod has been released witch doubles the amount of units)
Been playing the game since the kickstarter (since it was in a browser)I have always enjoyed the game specially fun for me when I needed a break from the other games I usually play.The graphics do look nice since they've updated the game.Its nothing to special, but its defiantly fun and worth the money.
i dont know why your reading this you should be buying the game...
Game has become fun since the F2P update and has a good player base so if it looks decent to you I say try it.
If you are considering of buying this game I would like to recommend you take a coding lesion, and make a game in which you walk forward. I strongly believe that it will be more entertaining and a better use of your time and money.
theres not much to say it works and does what you wantis not over priced and makes the game you're playing 10 times better
Its a fun little game about reselling items , and going into a dungeon to obtain items to selli would suggest this to anybody that i know and its wellworth the priceI just wish i could get it on my 3DS
If you like the trailer you just obtained 30 min of free entertainment.
Everything about this game is just perfectThe story is nice the game play fells satisfying the characters a written in a simple but good way the design and animations  are quite good the level design and abilities are great to(a nice thing about them is if you are taking longer breaks while playing you can quickly remember the combos and controls) i cant find a flaw about this game(and trust me a find bugs commonly in most games that are considers stable) The combos are great to and for the amount of entertainment you get out of this game the money is well worth itmaking a long story short its simple and fun
