-Are we downhearted? No!-Where to start with a game like this? Verdun is the first (to my knowledge) multiplayer FPS set in a realistic First World War setting, which is strangly something no one has attempted before. That being said Verdun offer a completely unique original expierence centered around immersion in a WW1 trench warfare environment. Being a bit of a history junkie myself  I found this game hard to resist and it did not disapoint.GAMEPLAY Verdun-'s gameplay is based (mainly) around team play, providing you and 3 other players with the ability to form one of the different squad types available to each side respectivly.
As fair as visuals go this game is lacking, but if you look past that the game play's solid enough to keep you interested and the enjoyed the story's surprisingly good! I recommend this game to people who enjoy DayZ and Grand Theft Auto
If you're a fan of naked people trying to beat you to death with a rock just because you tried to help them you'll love rust. 10/10
