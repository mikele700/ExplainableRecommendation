Absolute joke of a port, do not purchase the PC version of this game. Go get the console versions because they actually work and aren't run by absolute ♥♥♥♥ing morons. High Voltage Studios have dropped the ball big time with this game.
The title of the game has misled me, I thought I was going to play a solid first person shooter about killing floors. In actual fact, you don't kill any floors at all. Huge Disappointment of 2015.1/10 - It was okay
