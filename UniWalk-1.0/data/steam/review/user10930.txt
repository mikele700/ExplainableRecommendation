At first glance, HAWKEN may seem like a fast-paced, easy to play, balanced game. You are wrong.First, I would like to point out some issues with this game:a) Instead of using your own Steam account to play, you must make a different account, which has caused me and others to    wait for long periods of time just to wait for the non-Steam account to sync with the servers.b) The Main Menu of HAWKEN is very confusing to most new players, because it is filled with lots of advertisments to buy these special packs which is preposterous, in my opinion.c) Your starting Mech looks like a friggin TV with thin limbs and legs, and to customize it (and other Mechs), you must buy some camos and decals with real money. The only other way you could customize it is to change the frame of your Mech,and  all it does is add 0.01% more colour to it.d) The Primary guns in the game have almost identical stats(as of 3/19/14), which make you waste your hard-earned rewards on things that are almost the same as your stock weapon.e) For those gamers who've played fast-paced games such as Loadout, TF2, and Call Of Duty, I would like to say that no matter what Mech that you play as, you will be slow, and it is hard to tell if you actually damaged an enemy or not.f) The HUD that you will be using in the game will make you feel like you're actually inside a Mech, which is actually nice, but if you move or walk, the interface will shake in what direction you're going, therefore making you dizzy and/or distracted by it.g) In the matchmaking of this game, no matter what level you are, you could fight anyone. So what I'm saying is that you could be Level 1-5, but you will fight people who've tested the Alpha Version of this game a long time ago, and they'll show no mercy.Overall, this game has potential, but I honestly think that the devs need to work on almost EVERYTHING to make this game more appealing to gamers who have played countless fast-paced shooters.
