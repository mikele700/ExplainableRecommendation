This is the most addicting fun First Person Shooter F2P Game I ever played. I mostly play this everday, it-'s one of the sucessful franschise to come in Steam, It starts of 9 classes; Scout,Soldier,Pyro,Demoman,Heavy,Engineer,Medic,Sniper and Spy. These guys have diffrent strategys and the teams are Blu and Red, they fight off by going to gamemodes but mostly my favourite is Capture The Flag. My favourite class is Spy. It-'s pretty funny in my opintion including the -Meet The- videos were a great in♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tion for all the characters in my honest opintion.
This game is made in 2009, and still it's the best co-op game ever is. I reccommed that for starters if your in love with zombies, co-op and bunch of gamemodes; then this game is for you. I played this game in the Xbox first, mostly it was boring and had no people's creation maps, then I have gotten L4D2 from the PC. It was the best exprience I played by a bunch of zombies hiting on your way, I'd even almost lighty screamed when a swarm of Tanks are charging at me, it was the most realistic wa..*coughs* Ok it was not that realistic but still It's a wonderful exprience.
