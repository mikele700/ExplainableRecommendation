I've been playing games all my life and i never seen a game that is like Team Fortress 2. This game is both fun yet strategic.TF2 has a unique style of gameplay and game characters. The first Team Fortress (Team Fortress Classic) is so different in graphics and gameplay style wise. Also the hats, miscs and weapons are all great from your starting weapons, to strange weapons with thousands of kills after a while. Alltogether, I think TF2 is a game worth playing no matter where your from.
There are many games out there that are good or bad. In my opinion, this is a good game. This is because the unknown storyline of the main character is interesting and makes you want to find out. Also the gameplay for this type of game is good for this standard because the movement of this game is a tile structure/end turn game like Sid miers Civilisations. Furthermore you get to scavange for food, water, weapons, clothes, etc... Finally you get to battle enemies such as bandits and ferocious animals. Overall I believe this is a good game and worth playing.
It's awesome!
