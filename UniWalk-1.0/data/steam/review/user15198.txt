This game was very fascinating for me, being completely unfamiliar with CCGs, limited interest in turn based strategies and none at all in computerised boardgames - this game is basically all three, and it's easy to see this as a tabletop game. However, it sucks you in quickly and, it must be said, sneakily. The tutorials flow seamlessly into the main campaign, from missions where you have just a handful of cards and playing them is so simple you don't even grasp what the challenge could possibly be, and yet soon every missions presents a new and fresh challenge. This may be the best learning curve I have ever encountered, and the tutorialising is very gentle. You encounter more and more challenging units to defeat, and the game encourages out-of-the-box thinking. Beating the game is a healthy challenge, and 100% completion is Herculean, which is how it should be.The story, meanwhile, is absolute nonsense but very enjoyable. That is to say, it's steampunk.
