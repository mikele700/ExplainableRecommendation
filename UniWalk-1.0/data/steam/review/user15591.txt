Full of brilliant ideas, but from what I've played, those ideas have been poorly executed alongside aweful AI.
If you are willing to pay for microtransactions in-game, solid recommendation right here. A great open-world with a good amount to do other than main missions and endless customization option for your player, clothing, weapons and cars.  If you're not willing to pay for microtransations, I can't give it as much praise. This game is full of micro-transactions that will net you the best guns, gear and cars and you earn money and experience at twice the F2P rate. This means that if you decide to play for free, then you should be aware that you will get absoloutely demolished at some stages. Everything is an enormous grind and even though decent weapons are relatively cheap, they are only temporary.
This is an excellent game that is unfortunately held back by an unfunctional game client in Uplay. I've lost almost 70 hours of gaming because for whatever reason Uplay decided to erase it. This is a great game, but be careful of stuff like this.
