i have no clue how people play this piece of ♥♥♥♥ it basically scrams -WE ARE MICROSOFT. GIVE US YOUR MONEY-
im still waiting for steam to allow you to sell games
i enjoyed this game a lot. though it can be very laggy and glitchy. the gamplay and kills in the game were very ipressive and i love the xray mode. though i will say this, the levels can get boring and repettative.
