A extremly well made game with deep mechanics and university semester has just started. this does not bode well for me. RiP Post-Graduate degree.
You can change gender using a coffin. 10/10
So many feels, Clementine has evolved. This isn't even her final feel. Just so many feels. Get this feelcoaster of a game.
Completed the Objective, soldiers were captured anyway. Would lose timed missions again/10
So many zombies. So many feels. If you don't get any feels from this pretty feels on story, you're not a human being. Dat feel bro.
I've sunk 100+ hours into this Heist em up game. Ignore the graphic ♥♥♥♥♥ this game is epic. Soundtrack keeps the pace going. With continual updates from the developer in the same vain of Team Fortress 2, this game should be keeping healthy for a very long while.
