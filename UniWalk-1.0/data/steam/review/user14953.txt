Definitely a game worth the $10 (I got it for $2.50 during the March Indie Sale 2013), You can do anything in the game. The only limit is your imagination.
Players aren't the real threat; Nor are zombies,the real threat in this game..are the stairs.
the most annoying part of this game was waiting the 2 hours for the refund
A good game until you get too good at it and then get perm banned for hacking by a butthurt scrub. 10/10 have to relearn to be bad.
