This game taught me that altruism is a lie and to trust nobody, not even yourself.The killer is a well-oiled death machine from the inner circles of hell that wants you flayed and hooked.You are a ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥ who can only walk away slowly, blow up generators, harrass birds and jump through windows real fast.Your ultimate weapons are a flashlight and a toolbox, highly impractical and completely exhaustable.The only time I won this game was when I hid like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ when my teammates were being brutally slaughtered.|11/10 would jump through window again.
Hat fortress 3?
