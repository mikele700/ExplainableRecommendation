Highly recommended! Sadly the games deep interface and gameplay style will result in a large learning curve for newbies, but fight through that stage and the glorious light of Dota 2 will be shed upon you. Complex gameplay and fast pace will result in a game that you cannot finish or feel like you've fnished. With over 100 heroes there will always be something new to try! If you need any help learning I'd gladly help you out, just add me and say you want help with Dota! HAVE FUN!!!
