Be wary of death...
Is pre gud
Absolutely the best top down strategy game out there, the animations are super smooth and the equipment and weapons to use is so expansive its unbelievable. You can literally play this differently every time thanks to the mission generator so i'll be putting a lot more hours into this game. Definitely Indie game of the year 10/10.
Why am I writing this review, I haven't even opened the game yet
