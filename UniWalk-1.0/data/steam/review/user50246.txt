If you are new to the FPS Genre, I wouldn't recommend this game. Otherwise, if you're pretty good at fps's say you just got bored of CoD and you want a new fps game, I would definetly recommend it to you.

The custimisation in this game is very fun! the only problem was when people die! Some of those death stances are horrific! Once I was running to the other teams base and I saw a mage with his staff in his stommic.Wasn't a nice scene D:
