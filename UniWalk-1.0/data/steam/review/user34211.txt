Turbo Dismount has an excellent sense of dark humour; people getting hurt in comedic ways such as driving onto a minefield or having a race on a road covered with oil slicks.There is plenty of experimentation to be used, and you can go for a high score or just muck around!Highly reccommended, an affordable game too.
I recommend Garry's Mod because you can spawn pretty much anything and tinker with all sorts of things! Funny and creative at the same time, you'll be sure to have a great time wether it be making a movie or ruining movies, it's a surefire possibility. If you play sandbox games, get this one pronto!
