I recommend this game because its just like playing call of duty zombies but with robots and an endless wave of pure fun.Final Rush will be better if the multi-player was available so you can play with your friends plus the graphics are very nice and also the sound quality as well. But the only problem is the video settings, the only thing you can change is your resolution of your screen.
