THIS GAME IS AMAZING! it Beats Killing Floor 1 by a long mile! Even though its in early access. This game has great graphics and visuals. Amazing Gameplay. Still Badass SlowMo. And more zombies. This game is flawless other than it having little weapons and getting little amounts of money. This is well worth the $309/10
One of my favorite single player games. i am 9 hours in and still have not finished the campaign. its hard as hell but really fun 9.5/10
FNAF 3 is so much different to the other 2 but in a good way it is awesome!Pros:- Frightening jumpscares- All new strategy- New Camera System- New Office- New feeling- Lots of SecretsCons:- Restraunt looks really scrapped- Crashes (Scott is working on it)-  No Bonnie- Confusing StoryMy Rating; I Would rate this game 9/10 it is a awesome end to the franchise and i could not have been done better
