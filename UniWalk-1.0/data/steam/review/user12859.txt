I want to play in austrialia, but im forced to connect to NA servers which give me 170-something ping.They should make anyone can make any weapon for free, because now its just discouraging for people who have just started. Imagine if csgo or tf2 required you to upgrade your awp to make it a dakdak, or have a rocketlauncher that did far more damage than any other because you had played the game longer.Ontop of the fact that a fully upgraded sniper rifle takes AGES to kill and is super ♥♥♥♥.But that kinda makes my main point irrelevant.Whatever.This game is free, so its not like your gunna have to make some sort of investment but i wouldnt reccommend.4/10
Stole a car, got chased by the army, robbed consecutive stores, fought gangs and robbed a bank with some friendsThen I went home and i played GTA for a bit
that game looks epic
My grandfather used to always smoke. He smoked his whole life. My dad said, -listen here boi, if u keep smoking u aint gunna see yo grandkids-. He stopped, but 420 hours later he got cancer. I will never smoke because i dont want lung cancer, but i knda regret it because this game gave me ♥♥♥♥ing ballsack cancer anyways.
