Highly recommend this game.Not very many hours played (just on 78 hours) and I feel as if I could keep playing forever.With each new update comes heaps of new cool stuff.Playing with friends over multiplayer is great fun, just be sure to share the loot!10/10Wouldn't mind a MAC and Linux version of this game so all can enjoy.
