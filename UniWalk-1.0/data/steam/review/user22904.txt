Lag compensation is slightly less a issue unlike Blackops 2 where I got the compensation Horridly with my Fibre Optic connection_________________________My Speed Link to a speed test of my internet speed [www.speedtest.net]_________________________3: For once I don’t see many overpowered weapons used and even see 4: Perks system like bo2 which I like.Cons1: Lag compensation still affecting me in game.2: Annoying and stupid teams3: Bull crap deaths where you should of got the kill4: Aiming / Mouse smoothness is odd5: Broken steam overlay, and alt tabbing makes the game windowed and annoying to make it full screen again6: Frame stuttering without frame cap at the screen HZ you have or 58 is you pc/laptop is relatively slow.--7: Same ♥♥♥♥ each year in the end for the game re-skin, remap of the whole game.8: NO DEDICATED SERVER SHESH, common treyarch, activation this is not 2009 MW2 its 2015 coming on 16 put dedicated server up and not like BO1, server where we can host them ect. >:( >:( >:( >:( >:(In the cons I know some will be fixed soon but as of now this is my thoughts.I say yes BEARLY 51% to 49% so chose carefully if you want it or wait into free weekend and you like it get it.Elite Knight
