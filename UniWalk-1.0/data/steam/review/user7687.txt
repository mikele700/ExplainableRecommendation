This Game is Amazing!(JUST SAYING THIS GAME REQUIRES A CONTROLER) It actually feels like you’re flying the drone! They’ve done such a good job on this game. The tutorial sucked though, it’s a really bad way to start someone off who’s never handled a drone before. It’s difficult for someone who hasn’t had any experience. The tutorial level is really confusing and hard to tell where stuff is because the whole of the map is the same colour with no definition or shadows. I was playing the tutorial for ages not getting anywhere with my skill. But then I played the actual maps. The forest is the best map because it’s fun and easy! After playing on the forest map for a short time I really got the hang of the controls and synched all the other maps including the carpark witch is apparently the hardest. The graphics are stunning when camera sound is off, terrific use of shadows. Overall the game takes a bit to get use to but if you keep persisting by playing the tutorial for an hour or two then move onto the forest map you’ll be pro in no time! And this simulater is actualy helping me upskill with my IRL fpv drone.
NOBODY PLAYS THIS GAME ON PC!There are a lot of things wrong with this game. They’ve used the same graphics engine as MW3 and some strange new engine for movement that is heard to get used to. There are some elements in this game that’s completely new to COD, like having fire mode perks for almost all guns. However in saying this they’ve also taken a lot of elements out, simple elements that make COD… COD! Like care packages, they’ve been completely removed and replaced by “field orders” that only one player in the game can have at a time and the order it almost always really hard to do. The maps are painful and the server response time is real. But the biggest thing is that no one plays it! “0 Potential games found…” and on every game mode. If only they did a good job on this game in its early stages.
