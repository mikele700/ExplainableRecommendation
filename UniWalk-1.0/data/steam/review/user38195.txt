I have no idea how to play poker but this game is awesome! The best $2.50 I spent at the christmas sales!!The banter between characters is awesome and the TF2 unlocks are nice (achievement items only not tradable).If you play TF2 get this game! (especially if you are a Heavy fan) also recomend this as a -my first- poker game, if you want to learn to play poker by trial and error.Very nice to play!
This game used to be epic, not anymore, infact not for a long time now. Too many little kids and F2P players acting like jerks and swearing over the mic or in the chat box!! I play video games to meet new friends and have fun and this game is not fun anymore! Nothing seems to be done about the poor behaviour either as it's has gotten progressivley worse over the last few months especially on official MVM servers. Making this game F2P has killed it, sorry, killed it for me. If they make an update where the premium players don't have to deal with the F2P riff raff and make age restricted servers I'll come back, if not sorry Valve you have lost a customer. It's not worth the stress and anger and urge anyone who considers playing this game to be wary of the disgusting behaviours by players or avoid this game for a bit. I know Valve will sort this out eventually as they are a great company. Please Make TF2 and enjoyable experience again.
