w, a, s, d, and my LMB are all worn out. 10/10 will mash buttons like theres no tomorrow
Well... I played this game before it-'s F2P days and it was fun. The Oceanic servers died quickly sadly, but the american servers were still kicking and I could handle the lag.BUT! The day the F2P update came out, was the day I nearly ♥♥♥♥ myself... I saw this and saw the buyable in-game currency and nearly died. But to my delight the buyable currency was only for skins in-game which benedit you in no way.Only downfall now is, they removed the Oceanic servers completely (Which I still don-'t mind) and EVERY NEW GOD DAMN ♥♥♥♥ING PLAYER IS TONY!I played a game with one other -veteran- and 3 noob, F2P Tony-'s. Thought it was gonna be a bad day BUT WE STILL PUSHED THROUGH AND WON!
Terrific game when your playing with friends
