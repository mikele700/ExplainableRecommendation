This was a nice game that certainly shows promise, the acting is a little bit..erm...-B-...grade, but if you look past it, the storyline is definately there. This game is too short and leaves a massive cliff hanger at the -end- telling you there will be more to come (when, what, why???). follows the Human revolution skill tree style for your augmentations, but seems limited in comparison. this may only be because of the length of the game (its a $10 or less game). If your looking for a taste of the Deus Ex franchise this game is certainly a nice but subtle taste of the world. You will find the morals and ethics of Augmentation described very well, with more insight into the -human- aspect of augmentation.I would like to rave on about how this would give insight into what the future could be like, but there is just not enough meat on the bone of this game (not like Human Revolution) but with some more -episodes- this should turn out well. The combat is okay, but slams it home that regardless of your Characters -skills- and background, going in guns blazing is almost never a good idea, you can manage fairly well if you have cover and the right gun, but stealth and non-lethal measure seem to be the key to getting things done. You aim is terrible until you get the Augmentation for both aim and recoil, but upping your cloke and silent running seems to be more effective, and as long as you have the energy, a takedown is more effective anyway. I will not harp on too much more, as the rest can be decided by yourself. I do recommend this game, but take it with an open mind and do not expect AAA game dev, but this is a nice little look into the world of Deus Ex as it currently stands.6/10
