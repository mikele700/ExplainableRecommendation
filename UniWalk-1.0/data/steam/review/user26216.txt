Cities in Motion 2 is quite an entertaining game. The maps which you work with are very realistic with great attention to detail. All the cars, people, buildings and objects run as if it was a real world. For example; if you follow a random citizen who works in the city, you'll notice that he/she will leave in the morning to head to his/her workplace in either a personal car or a pt (public transport) vehicle. He/she may either travel to a office building in the city, or possibly a factory. He/she will then come back to his/her house in the evening. You will then have to look at how you may provid public transport for the citizen. If theres one thing that should be changed, it should be the waterbuses. I do not use them often, because I find them hard to use. They are also not effective, as not as many people catch waterbuses, as they may do for trains or buses. They should instead use monorails. They would be more fun to use. If you would like monorails in the game, there is a new DLC for it. It is also currently %50 off (25/6/14).-Jimes105 (Find me on youtube!)
A great game, with awesome attention to detail.
