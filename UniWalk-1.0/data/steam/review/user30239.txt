Shadowrun Returns is from my limited knowledge a reboot of an old classic RPG? And may also have ties to Tabletop RPGs I honestly don-'t really know.What I do know: The game is thoroughly ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Even if it does just assume you know what you-'re doing from the start, with all the little bits and pieces and features and combat mechanisms. I was left on my own to work out what the shiny circles were and the skulls and the percentages and that I could change weapon types and cast spells or change attack types. It-'s all very new and there-'s NO TUTORIAL. It-'s great. I actually really like the -Throw you in the thick of it- tactic.For a brief run down on the story and setting, though: Shadowrun Returns is about a burnt out Runner (You, and a runner is a merc), broke and starving in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ apartment somewhere in America in 2054. Magic has come back to the world and with it; Elves, Dwarves, Orks and Trolls. Technology has merged with the flesh and the mind, magic is a thing that you can cast, and it-'s basically a fantastic dystopian fantasy setting. You end up getting a job that takes you to a bar in Seattle, and from there you meet some really weird people.Skulls, Gas Masks, Corpses galore, Guns aplenty, a spot of humour, a spot of gore, nothing too graphic. Beautiful game.
Super quirky cult classic game, chock full of morbid humour and occasionally disturbing situations. 100% recommend!
