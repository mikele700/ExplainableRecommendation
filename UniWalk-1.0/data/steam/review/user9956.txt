no oceanic servers or anythinggg 10/10In all seriousness, this is Minecraft with Guns, pretty much. Just install Flans mod for Minecraft. It's alot better than this.
Some people don't like this game for who knows what reasons, so I'm going to do a quick rundown.Yes, it is a zombie game. Like Left 4 Dead, just without pills being thrown at you. And tanks. Oh Lord, the tanks.In the beginning, the title screen, for me, even that was ominous. The title music, the background, everything. Twas spooky.The mechanics are kinda like CoD, with the crouching helps aim, and iron sighting, and the v to melee thing. Yes, we get it. It's like CoD.The inventory system is very realistic. None of the characters have backpacks (at least I haven't noticed one), which means you can only carry 4 items. Preferrably, keys, melee, pistol, and rifle.The zombies, seeing there is no special infected, range from slow as a wet week, to track runner zombies.The players side is cool as well, seeing that you will need health as it goes on, and that once you die, you don't respawn. No resupply closets, nothing. Although you can become a zombie once you die, or if no player zombies are enabled, then you'll become a kawaii little insect. Naww, cute :DAll in all, Contagion is a good game. The corpses don't usually lag you out, and you can get blood and gore in it. What more could you want?10/10. 10/10 100/100 best game. best game
