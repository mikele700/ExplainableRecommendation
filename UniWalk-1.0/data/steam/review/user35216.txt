-20/1000Should not play again. Zombies are allowed to run up while my guy has a ♥♥♥♥ing picnic.Who needs walls when you become dead right, just walk right on through and hit what ever ♥♥♥ you want. I wish these were new bugs but Dean Hall won-'t stop climbing ♥♥♥♥ing Mt Everest. Melee weapons do nothing either -Whats that, you want to kill that zombie with a sledge hammer, you better hit it 20,000 times in the head if you want to give it a slight tickleMaybe in another 3 years ill play this and it might be in Beta.
Although it has its bugs its still a fantastic game with a good storyMaybe wait a little bit for the price to drop and for RS to bring some more patches out but it is a worthy game to buy
