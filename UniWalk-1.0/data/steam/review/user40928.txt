ok... where do i start? first i spawn in craft a bow, shoot a guy in the cranium.. let me say that again, in THE CRANIUM... he then proceeds to run me down and axe me a question. Before he did this however i hit him the head 10+ times with a branch. ok let me list the rest the of the things I dislike.-This games is a spam e and eat berries simulator-airdrops are overpowered and need to be removed, pay2win at its finest-your food goes down faster than your water, how on earth is that realistic, you have to eat more than you drink. Is my character obese and have a severe tuna can addiction?-the lagg, I am australian and being fond of these zombie survival games i thought i would give it a try. There were no australian servers so the lagg is insane, it literally takes 0.5-1 second(s) to simply start the timer to loot something absolute bs.-bows and arrows: if you are going to make guns rare, altleast make the bows viable, the arrows drops like it is made of f***ing lead like wtf. I have to aim like 15 metres above a zombies head to kill it, srsly?these are just a few but I refuse to recommend this game until they make it playable.fix your ♥♥♥♥ bungie
This game has massive potential, sure the mod has more in it now, but dayz has its own coding, offering more potential. I recomend this game to anyone.
