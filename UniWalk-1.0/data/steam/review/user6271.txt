Pass the whiskey.
Great game. It's a bit easy at the start, but gets really hard towards the end, so it'd be a mixed game for people. I myself, know of friends who do not like the game, but I have friends that do like the game and they really like it, and mainly for one reason.Stamper.Stamper, the in game voice narrarator, has stupidely funny lines.That's all i'm going to say, if you pick up this game you'll know what I mean.and here's a list of pros/consPros:The storyline is funny.Stamper makes a great narrarator.The gameplay is a fun platformer with quite a few mechanics.Multiplayer is great, I had friends laughing quite a bit there.Cons: Fighting is not that good.(minor) It influences heavily on Xbox controllers, and most will not have one.All in all, it's a great game, you should pick it up, I definitely had a great time with it.
it was ok
i've only played this game for 3 hoursit has a tentacle melee called the voilater.1/1 would slap people with hentai again.
