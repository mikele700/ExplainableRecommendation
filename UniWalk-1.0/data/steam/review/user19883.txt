Good placement = Definite win. Make good use of the dig & pauses.
I found this game abit more challenging as compare to iBomber Defense Pacific, because of the Axis mode.
Well, only the Timewalk seems cool here.
Something you can try when you're bored, & always stuck at Level 54 -.-
Those skill keys are.. hard to remember -.- Have to Esc and check everytime.
CPU have better hands compared to Poker Night 1, but still easy to win if you can trick them.
CPU are dumbs! Easy win even with weak hand.
 The gameplay is good, suggested to try on for APOCALYPTIC mode to unlock more achievements without going through the 2nd time.
Mind ♥♥♥♥ed! If you are a Chemical Pyscho, here's for you!
Nice game to try, but you will need to restart it again and again for achievements.
