Love this game. The story was bit odd at first, but at the end of it all I loved every bit. The art style fit the game perfectly kinda felt like a animated move from Disney, odd to say, loved it none the less. The music in this game is just beautful. I could just stay at the main menu listening to its music. I would love to see another sequel of some sorts. One of my all time favorites. Gotta try it.100/10
