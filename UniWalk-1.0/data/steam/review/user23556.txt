Yes. The game is rich 2D mario Platfomer and can turn a easy game to a hard well timed aiming gun thing. BroForce is a game to spend 1-2 hour trying to complet a level and lots and lots of weapons/Abilitys (And Flexing a crap).In my opinion the game is a game to get.I give it 4.75 out of 5 Bro whiping Terrorist.
I is the year 2002 it a good game with lot of ways to go. I recommend. 9/10 golden 2002 computers
