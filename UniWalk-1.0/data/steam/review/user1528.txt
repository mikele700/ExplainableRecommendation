The compatability is strict to directx11 so anyone who doesnt have a high end computer wont be able to properly play this game or even survive the 1 frame per second.
I brought the game few days ago and the game doesnt work. No servers are being found no official servers no community servers no modded servers. what a waste of $20 that was when i cant play the game and only make it to the menu. And better yet after 20-30 seconds being in the menu the game client stops working and doesnt respond. This game is a joke dont buy it.
