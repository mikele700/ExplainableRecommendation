great story can--'t wait for part 2 sound overlaps sometimes but i really did enjoy it cant wait you guys did a great job smooth  transition from scene to scene
it is a great game i suggest getting it it might just be me but i am completly addicted to this game i think it could be improved by being able to create your own chracter and and build a base (settlement as i think it kinda suits the game) i think if there where more npcs, quests and a choce feature (being able to change the main story just a bit) i think that it would be a bit better but all these suggestions are what i would like to be implemented to the game but over all i think its a fun game in which you could have alot of fun with friends or on your own (forever alone) in my opinion it is a realy good game but that is my opinion it wasnt as hardcore survivail that i would like it to be there is water food items every where its good if you just want to play it casual but not the best game if you want to play hardcore (chuck norris style) over all i play alot of zombie games like dayZ, deadrising, dead island, state of decay and left 4 dead but also a lot of survival games like rust, dont starve and neather and overall i give it    7/10 freedom   8/10 survival    8/10 graphics    7/10 story    9/10 awesomeness
Brilliant just brilliant that is all
