Amazing game, variety of game modes, unique play style. After playing alot of CSGo its nice to come back to this where movement has no bearing on aim and rocket jumping around maps in seconds is possible. Fast paced yet subtley slow. Grand game, grand community. 10/10 play this ♥♥♥♥ing game
Installed game.Caught whiff of story.Unintalled game.10/10 Throw money at this game.More details:As the story goes, a group of adventurer ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s once lost one of their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s... uh, adventurers. Turns out that he was possessed some kind of 'ultimate evil,' who then guides you through the game so that you'll be strong enough to present a challenge to him eventually. He really didn't think that one out, because you basically mow him down like you're holding a chainsaw and he's your noisy neighbour. Kind of like what I want to do to whoever wrote this crappy story.
