This game is absolutley fantastic, I enjoy every second playing it, especially with friends!  Very tactical and educational in a way.  They have done exceptionally well with this free to play game!  10 out of 10!
I strongly recommend this game, it's a brilliant coop, fun if played with friends, it's a good laugh! :)
Great game, but needs more content and it needs to be purchasable with in game earnable money.  No premium ♥♥♥♥.  <3
It is amazing.  A bit like Dayz, so if there's people who can't afford Dayz, this is an awesome substitute!!! Enjoy!!
I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a laugh!
Great game all in all.  But you will need a fast pc because the guys who made this put like millions of textures in one pixel and it lags like a boss if your pc is slow!!
