This is one of my favourite games by far at this point in time, and I very much doubt that much will change my mind any time soon.  Why wouldn't you want to create space colonies, space stations, refuelling stations, rovers, planes, space planes and etc.  The mod support is fantastic. Most mods seem to be compatible with most versions. I have never had a mod clash with this game personally, and that's all due to the mods all being installed into the one folder. This prevents clashes and makes it easier for anyone wanting to install mods.I t may not be for everyone, but I do recommend it.
