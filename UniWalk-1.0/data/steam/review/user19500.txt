this game is made to be co-op its awesome fun esp harder levels, you really need the right combo of gear
Dota 2 is a very fun game, ive played LOL and other similar games but dota 2 just has something unique about it, the characters are fun and in game they have clever puns where they boast at each other. I have played for over 500 hours and i highly  recommend it :)
