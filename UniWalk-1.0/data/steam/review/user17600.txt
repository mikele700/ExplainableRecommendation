Best free game I've ever played.
REALLY fun with mates, but only if you've got a controller.7/10 because although it IS fun, it lacks the content to keep you entertained for many hours of gameplay.
-HUAH, HUAH. HUAH HUAH HUAH. HUAH... HUAH. HUAH, HUAH HUAH HUAH HUAH. HUAH HU- AGHH!-10/10, it-'s free.
If you enjoy gore, this game is for you.
Simple & fun.
A very rewarding game, if you know how to use teamwork. Unlike any other FPS out there.
