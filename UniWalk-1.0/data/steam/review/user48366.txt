where to start, right this is a robocraft a game purely for building and fighting other robots that can have different terrain mobility, for example a basic one is wheels, they start at an early level of tier 1 (level 1) and go all the way up to the highest level of tier 10 (level 10), their are 6 categories of movement, hovers, walkers, wheel, treads, aerofoils and skies now i won go in to detail about all of them cause thats what YoU have to find out! now remember this game is still in pre-alpha which means it is not in full realse so their is a few bugs here and their but nothing that stands out to the fact of how good freejam has made this game. to be honest at the start it is quiet boring but once you get to tier 3 - tier 5 it gets a whole lot more interesting. if you like world of tanks, the blocky images in minecraft and is able to use your imagination to the fullest, then i defiantly suggest this game to you!ardeous-Briz
