extremely fast paced game with simple but addicting mechanics.
this game is the best mix of a RTS/ TBS/ rogue-like game i have ever played. i recomed this more than i can recomend any game i have played. the music is perfect. the difficulty is perfect (very difficult) and with the new expansion pack it is even more beautiful.
