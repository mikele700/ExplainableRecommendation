99% of n user reviews for this game are positive.It was the first thought when I bought this game, and I have no regrets.Longer Version (Playtime of the game itself):I would still recommend this game even how it's not all filled with features and such. Probably when it gets released from early access, it will be much more fun to play.SPOILERS AHEAD!At first, it starts out bland, but then you start to automate for ores and turn it into plates, where plates are used to create tools. After manually researching, you decide you should automate Science. (At this point let's say we have electricity) After auto research, a biter attack happens. You only have a gun to protect yourself as a gun turret is still being built. You then defend your base, and automate more science. 10-30 hours later, you are already building a rocket silo, where you finish the game. You then decide to install mods, where you go all over again with a new experience. It never ends.In a nutshell, words cannot express how much this game is fun.Originally posted by Holy_Sinner:I used to have a family. Now I have a factory.10/10 ruined my life
