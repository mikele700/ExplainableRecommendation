What I think personally?This is a really great game, with some smart ideas and good gameplay.This game is better playing with friends but the multiplayer setup is way to confusing to understand (at least for me).even though its in Early Access people still tend to complain about the most stupidest things, like bugs/glitches and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and how dinosaurs can kill you so easily.THEIR ♥♥♥♥ING DINOSAURS WHAT DID YOU EXPECT, you can't just go running up to one with a gun, shot it and expect it to die insistently.Aspects:-Its a game where you have to be stealthy and really have to listen (so its best to play with a good headset) and YOU don't want to make too much noise (such as running) near a Dino, because it will hear you. because of   this it really adds to the atmosphere and the environment, and what you would most probably to in a situation like that.-The Dinosaurs are pretty good, since the game is early access there are only a couple of Dino species in the game, Each Dino has a weak point (being the heart and ♥♥♥♥) attacking there does more damage then attacking like the side or neck.they can be a pain to kill but once you do. you get that feeling of accomplishment.-The weapons are alright, you'll be lucky to find a big crate containing a weapon or clothes?But mostly you get ammo for the gun you haven't found, but the weapons do some good damage, just make sure you aim at the right areas of the dinosaurs to do MORE damage.-The map, Oh Boy, THE MAP IS ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING, its huge it has amazing looks and landmarks ^-^The only downside to the map is climbing up slopes, they can be really steep and if you climb up a mountain, half way it will become too steep and you can't climb any further. Plus you can take fall damage from sliding down slops so watch out- Loot Crates do spawn all around the map, and there's certain areas where good loot spawns.Loot mostly contains:WeaponsClothesAmmoHealthFinal:As i said the game is still in early access so not everything is in the game, but it still is a great game to playJust don't ♥♥♥♥ off a T-Rex, okay? Final-Final:So is this  a good game to buy and play: YESIt is worth the $20 you stole
