Great port, fast loading times, no crashes as of yet. Smooth 60FPS with no framedrops. Gameplay is pretty much the same as I expected coming from the first PSP game I got. Very satisfied with the pre-order. The costumes are a bit meh but you do get 2 games for one.Only con is the English voices but I can tolerate that.
Darn this game is amazingly addictive and makes you compel to finish the storyline.I recently got this game and decided to try it out since I have heard alot of nice things about it, and me being a fan of JRPGs certainly does help. 11 hours later, I completed the game. Well, granted I did it on the 2nd difficulty level, which is easy, it is still a fun game to play. This is one of the only few games which I powered through to the end, the others were the Assassin Creed's series up to Revealations and some others. P.S: The art style reminds me distinctively of the Golden Sun series on Gameboy, which is another highly rated game I would suggest people to play.
Game-play is pretty decent from what I tried of it, till the developers decided to add in a feature for server admins to check on VAC bans.In essence, if you got a VAC ban from any other game, do not buy this for the multiplayer. You will be unable to find ANY good servers to play on since they are almost all set to ban you. I am quite sure they should be required to put a disclaimer about this as it practically renders the multiplayer unplayable for people with VAC bans. This is also that most people would assume that a VAC ban would not affect another game as evidence by Valve own VAC FAQ stating that particular fact. So yes, if you like WW2 squad based tactical FPS, and a solid NO if you have a VAC ban of any sort. Wish I can get a refund for this now.
