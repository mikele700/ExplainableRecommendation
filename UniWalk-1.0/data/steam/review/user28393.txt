it could be a -upgraded- version of c.s 1.6 but even c.s looks like a amazing piece of work next to this game
ação que segue a historia paralela do principal half-life 2 contando uma historia envolvente com puzzles e combates
MEDIOCRE!
the game has become abandonware(if you really want to buy it buy on a sale)
i was so happy and excited when i got this game because i got it free and im kind of a DiabloFreak but (apologize my bad english) it had a nice concept but they simply -crapped and converted in a game- this game probably was made on the lowest budget ever seen i wonder if this game was made on a toilet or inside a trashcan it-'s awesome whe you see the concept of -Sci-Fi Diablo like Rpg- but no joking dude The plot is basically: YOU AR A ONE-EYED BADASSS GANERIC CHARATIER IN SPAAAICE KILIN ALIUNS AND YU ZES SPESHUL. yes thats all the plot also . . . the hud, menu and textures are pretty MEH/♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you think that the game -looks pretty good- believe me don-'t try it , ok? cuz SPESHUL GAME FER SPESHUL PEPLOE.
