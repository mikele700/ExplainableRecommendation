This is a very good game because of the graphics and gamplay but it would be better if it had multiplayer.
Ai as monster in matchmaking should at least be more balanced because they only aim for medics not any 1 else, I always attack the med when i am the monster but im not as brutal as the ai because everytime i ply as medic ai always tries n kill me n not any 1 else, the ai will chase me down till i die. pls balance the matchmaking ai as monster because for me medics r useless when ai is the monster in matchmaking. But i still like the game.
