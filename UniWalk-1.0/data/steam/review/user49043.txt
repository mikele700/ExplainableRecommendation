Where do I start on the greatness of this Masterpiece in the gaming industry! The Releationships you have with some of the greatest characters ever made!Also the Story, the Combat, the Exploring and of course Commander Shepard make this game well worth the price!Well worth another few playthroughs!
Definitely one of the best zombie games I've ever played!From going around to abandoned buildings to scavange for items that you and your group need, to the fact that once one of your characters or group members die, they stay dead for the rest of the game.Definitely a brilliant game!Also, never go in alone to take on a horde of zombies. That can be a huge mistake.
For Anyone Who Is Looking For A True Alien Game That Matches The Same Tension And Atmosphere Of The 1979 Movie, You Are In For Treat. A Truly Great Experience, Although It Does Have A Couple Of Flaws (Some Deaths Feel Really Cheap). But That Doesn't Take Away It's Greatness. Also, The AI For The Alien Is Some Of The Best I Have Ever Seen. It's Unpredictable And Very Clever.And The Atmosphere Is So Good That It Pulls You In, And Doesn't Let Go.Truly One Of The Best Survival Horror Games I Have Ever Played.
One of the most Atmospheric and Scariest games I have ever played.Once you start playing, it doesn't let you go from its tight grip, and once you taste what it has in store for you, you want to see it through to the very end.Fans of the Horror Genre should definitely pick this up.
It is, if not the greatest game you will ever play
