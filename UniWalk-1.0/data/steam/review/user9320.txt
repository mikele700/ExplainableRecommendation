Kill chicken = Whole town attacks you.10/10
After many hours of playing this game, I can (with 100% certainty) confirm that this is the best city building simulator ever. 10/10.
-Amazingly fun.-Runs perfectly on my GTX970/i5-4590 rig.-Story is meh, but it's Doom, so it really doesn't matter.-Gunplay is intuitive and smooth, really feels like the old 90's games.-Multiplayer is super fun, I don't know what the fuss was about.-Graphics are amazing, especially on ultra settings.-BUY IT!
Preordered the game a day before it came out... Totally worth it. It looks awesome and the performance is amazing. I don't know what all the fuss was about. 10/10.
