Very good game in terms of FPS, DO NOT BUY THE GAME IF YOU LIKE AIMING DOWN SIGHTS CAUSE YOU WILL SUCK GIANT NUT SACKS AT THIS GAME. Anyway, the game is very tactical in many senses and team work is essential. The VAC system on CSGO is really ♥♥♥♥ing dusty if you ask me, i play with atleast one hacker every day. 8/10 very good mechanics but the ♥♥♥♥ing 64 tick servers awwwwwwwww m8. anyway buy the game its good
