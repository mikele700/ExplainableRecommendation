Man I love Genital Sniping Elite V2 Simulator 2012!Every time I cut their heads with one piece of slick spinning metal I feel the power surging through my testicles like a lightning bolt hitting a steel rail and someone is holding it at the same time.I can't explain how good it feels to tear their limbs, brains, throat, eyes, face, head, lungs and other important parts (reproduction anyone?). I wish to give everyone in this game a vasectomy free of charge. No really! I insist!
Whatchu' lookin' at fool? Buy the damn game!

I've been playing this game for almost 2 hours since I installed and I was so in the zone I felt like I was playing it for a solid year.10/10 would displace time again.
Dat ♥♥♥ Hunting Simulator 2014!
This simulator looks like a 5 minute quicky done in Unity, the default assests from Unity are there, the coding is terrible and overall the game looks like someone ♥♥♥♥ on their keyboard and out popped this game.2/10 (the 2 is for making me review this crap)The only good thing about this would be the vehicles?? The Crane was coded rather well, but the whole experience is ruined with the chainsaw.
Are you just going to stand there?Or are you going to get revenge?A post apocolyptic game such as this deserves a well spoken review so here it is: Buy the f**king game, that is all; thank you for reading.
