Ok. Before I begin my rant, good game. I bought Godus in its really early stages (before a single player review was released), liked it, but got bored after a while. Every so often I would revisit and check it out again. So I heard Godus v2.0 was out. Sweet! I try it and I like it. A lot. It was better than the old version by far - except for the bugs. The tons and tons of bugs. Some black squares appear after a while and flash around - driving me crazy. But when I restart the game they go away. No biggie. After some progress I finally discover voyaging. I try it once, but then I have to go. I come back two days later, the game loads, opens up, and the crashes. Straight away. No warning, nothing. I've tried tons of times to fix it - but nothing works. Seriously guys! Why would you release a super buggy game?! I would have been more than happy to wait that extra however-long-it-takes so that you can have a good v2.0! Not cool. Anyways, good game, very buggy - and now I can't play it anymore.
