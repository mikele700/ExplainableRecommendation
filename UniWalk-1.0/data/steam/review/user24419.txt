Wrecked my social life and took my money for a large portion of my pre-pubescent life, 10/10
I thoroughly enjoyed this game, a very funny storyline and a great combat system were my favourite aspects; the major letdown for this game was the length, I would like to see some campaign DLC's, however, that will probably never happen
