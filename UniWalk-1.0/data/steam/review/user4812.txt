I could not recommend this game enough.I played Borderlands, loved it. I played Borderlands 2, loved it. I saw the first teaser for Tales from the Borderlands and thought -what the hell are they thinking? Borderlands is a shoot-and-loot game! Not an interactive story!- I didn-'t think it would work at all.How wrong I was.The story was gripping and the gameplay did not disappoint. From the beginning to the end I couldn-'t tear myself away from it.10/10 would recommend to everyone.
