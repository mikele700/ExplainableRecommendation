Really fun game, wack it on with 2-4 controllers and you'll be having a blast. Very easy to pick up, very hard to master. Each level throws your previous plan out the window (which I like) while still allowing certain players to stick with certain roles. I work in hospitality so it is satisfying to assign players roles and watch everyone work together as a well oiled machine. Only critisism would be that local co-op only limits play time when you don't have a couple of friends to play with. This is not a loss for the game, however it limits the amount of time I will play it. I would also say that there are some frustrating quirks in the game such as food getting stuck on corners of benches and plates getting fused into the sink. These are incredibly minor and do not degrade from the experience heavily as more plates and more food are available.9/10 definitely a fun one to have a couple of beers and play.
