Seeing the same games been made again and again, just with different looks and finding minecraft ripoffs around every corner well I honest to god swear that this is everything but. Ninja bunny with kick ♥♥♥ moves aswell as other animals, seemed like they had a cat as a mum and human as a dad, but not weird ♥♥♥♥ like tekken and dragon ballz ♥♥♥♥ im talking about like kick you opponent so hard in the ♥♥♥♥ with you hoofs that he goes flying onto the floor and die-'s slowly and jumping into the air and stomping the ♥♥♥♥ out of people-'s head then you kick them. You know what this game actually require-'s skill -but you will learn grasshopper, (except jumping 100% off the time renders you invincible) ♥♥♥♥ing better then assasincreed parkour making the assainscreed look like its for mentally disabled people who can-'t press buttons- and you can do all this and its still alpha -say whaaattttt?- yeah thats right but yourself a favor and get some, I mean ugh look at a tutorial for more fun download a parkour map and look at a tutorial for that.Oh and I almost forgot its got verus on the same CP so if you have 2 keyboards or 1 keyboard and 1 xbox controller or 2 xbox controllers then you can verus each other sick huh, anyways ask me you questions if you wanna know more or wanna get 2 free games when you buy this
Was gonna be so good, ♥♥♥♥ed it up. Basicially a steal of your money kinda makes you not wanna buy alpha games anymore incase they end up like this pile of crap, un-finished just makes you wanna cry. Why u do dis CODEHATCH *slow clap*
Very different, fun and its cool how you can do way more in this game with just a simple gun then others
Look this is one amazing game I must say and it's honestly way too cheap for what it's actually worth. Most definitely worth your time, especially if you like the genre but try it even if you don't I'm sure you'll have a change of heart
Yus
Very very worth it, boring and slow at times but if your good you will triumph and enjoy it very much especially if you patient
AWESOME AS ♥♥♥♥ like GTA except super badass with heaps of action, explosions, destructions and hole ♥♥♥♥ load more of action. Singleplayer and Multiplayer both extremely sexy its must buy!
