This game made me ejaculate so violently and explosively that i blacked out, waking up two weeks later with my house being robbed and my body being stripped completely bare. The only thing the robbers didnt take was my laptop, so i dragged my crusty naked body over to my desk and started playing Terraria again.
10/10 mint game
Top game for top kids

Great game, even more fun with friends
Perfect blend of skill, tactics, action and teamwork. Yes this game is hard at first, you will need to put a lot of time into it to truely learn the mechanics and spray patterns. But once you get good and your game sense starts to build, there is no game quite like csgo.
