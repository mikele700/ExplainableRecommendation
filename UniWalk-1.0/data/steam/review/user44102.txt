I highly recommend this realistic style FPS to anyone interested in tactical and strategic gameplay. Having no unlocks whatsoever is a great advantage, leveling the playing field for everyone and having the ability to customise your loadout to your own play style. I have only owned this game for around two weeks and am hooked!
