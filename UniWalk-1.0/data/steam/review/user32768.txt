I am having a HUGE issue with some sort of graphic glitch where the textures just freak out for some reason. I've been looking up guides for how to solve this problem but non of these work for me. Ubisoft, please fix/patch this big issue. Untill then I want my money back. :(If someone know a good way to solve this then please let me know.
