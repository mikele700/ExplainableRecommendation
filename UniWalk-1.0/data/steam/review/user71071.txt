As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing & starving on a mysterious island, you must hunt, harvest, craft items, grow crops, & build shelters to survive. Use skill & cunning to kill, tame, breed, & ride Dinosaurs & primeval creatures living on ARK, and team up with hundreds of players or play locally!Now, Ark is a wonderfully beutiful, and fantastic game. I love ARK and yet I have some HUGE issues that have been bugging me. 1, I cannot play singleplayer. For some reason every single time I try to play singleplayer the game crashes for no reason and my computer can handle ARK fine and I didnt have this bug up until a couple months ago if you know how to fix this please comment so I can fix my game! 2, I cannot start a non-dedicated server so I can play with my friends this is essentially the same as the first problem but I can still join games and such. Again if you have an answer to the bugs please comment! Other than these bugs I have no problem with the game and I still recomend buying the game!
10/10 IGN Buetiful and inovative map thats larger than -The Island-Love the big floating island in the centre!
