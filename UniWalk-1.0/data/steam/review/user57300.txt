One of the best gaming experiences of the past 3 years for me. I became immersed in the story and in the fragile nture of Lara and her adventure. It works like  good game should, it creates emotions an you become attached to some charcters and the story is really good and of some historical fact which keeps the story really interesting. Good combat system, good upgrade system and great exploartion.
