First things first: This game is really, really good.To play this game you need to understand that your kingdom will NOT always keep your enemies out. In other words: dont count on winning the game on your second or third try. Although you will gradually survive longer, you will eventually have to start again, and again, and again. Pros:-Aweosome survival/stratergy game-Nice pixel art-Really challenges the player-Did I mention that it has some beautiful pixel artCons:-Very difficult (There is no difficulty setting which would be nice)-Day/night cycles are ridiculously short-Horse stamina takes a really long time to recover-Workers are very slow-Archer AI is not very good-every 5 nights there is a really difficult wave-Short tutorialOverall this is a really good game that could benefit from a few more options but other than that its great! Although I bought this game during a sale for half price it is definalty worth the $10 it usually is.EDIT:After some of the latet updates the AI's have been improved so much and now archers and builders run back to your base when it gets dark which is nice. Also, now there is no 'blood moon night' every 5 days which gives you more time to prepare, but it seems to be random which makes it hard to predict what to do.
