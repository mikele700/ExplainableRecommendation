Seriously, Save your money this game is horrible.. Also most of the time your lucky to find anyone actully playing it.I know thats it's technically free to play but it gives you an option to Upgrade for $10.. Don't.. Just Don't
Really Fun.. If you were to buy this make sure you have some friends to play with though. It can get boring just playing with randoms.
An Amazing Game that I would Highly Recommed because the amount of detail that has been put into customization with masks and Guns, etc
Its a Great game. I would recommend it to everyone that likes to mess about and have fun.
