I really didn-'t think I would like this game, but all it took was a FREE weekend demo and I find it a fascinating and interesting game. Different from anything I have ever played before. Mostly I stick to FPS and driving games such as my favorite Tactical Intervention which has both FPS and driving together so its my favorite game. But Depth offers a total -other world- experience both pragmatically and literally in that in effect it offers FPS and scuba diving as well as taking on the persona of THE SHARK...LOL! Which is probably the most unique feature I have ever experienced in any game. While it is not over simple in that there is a very small learning curve it is a very small curve especially after completing the free game tutorial. As a matter of fact if you complete the tutorial you are even rewarded for that with a free skin that you would have to otherwise purchase with in game money! After the tutorial you have pretty much over come the learning curve and you will know how to play. I would recommend this game to any FPS player looking for something unique and different. I will buy it now that I have tried it whether it was on sale or not. The game is at a great price this weekend but I would buy it at full price now that I have tried it. Its well worth the money even at full price. You won-'t be dissapointed with this game. It is a lot of fun. Buy it!
Those of you who have not played...DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE MISSING. ITS FREE GIVE IT A TRY!
The best game I have ever played.
Great Game, reminds mr of the movie -HEAT-.
