A really enjoyable action game, with an awesome construct engine and really fun and dynamic gameplay. I really dig the different ways to get around the map, so no bot should ever be the same :)UPDATE: Well, it was a good game, for the first 6 months or so, then they f*cked up by trying to rebrand it as a MOBA, and now everything is sh*t. SMGs are overpowered, plasmas are useless, the new game mode is sh*t, and rather than balance the game - they release cosmetic blocks, and basically its another sh*tty money sink. NOT WORTH IT - fix your ingame balance, nerf SMGs, and basically get good.The building aspect is fun... being zerged by a full team of flying smg, is not. Funnily enough.

Lock on Missiles, flaks, mech legs, ♥♥♥♥ is off the chain.Once upon a time, I believed Robodizzle would be the next fresh prince, and you know what, once they stopped limiting us to the MOBA game type, the game became great again.Back to a postive review, I hope this helps someone out there one day.
sidescrolling fun!
