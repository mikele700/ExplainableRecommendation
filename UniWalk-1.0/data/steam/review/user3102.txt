THIS GAME SO BAD ITS NOT A FAR GAME YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING I WAITED 2 HOURS TO PLAY THIS
Its a good game i enjoy hunting animals in this game but the one problem is you need to get a liceance to hunt wich cost real monny and guns but on the other head its a good game
im still learning how to use it but its good so far
