Unreal tourney meets Mech worrior!This game favours strategy over skills, the pace of the game and adequate lag compensation means competing internationally is possible. The mechs are fairly balanced and are more of a 'in the right hands' situation (I didn't play pre-balance but I imagine a lot of the complaints come from vets who found a nieche). It's possible to still MVP with the default mech should you pilot correctly! (even on the east cost servers from Australia)Cons: Upgrade system is heavily geared to the f2p model (you cannot share parts between mechs), abandoner's wreck up matches as they are constantly leaving to find an easy win for daily rewards. Hopefully the new devs address all these and free an amazing game from the shackles of f2p.Pros: Its not hard to be effective with any given mech when you play as a team, the p2w complaint is a moot point. Runs well, looks like a Blomkamp flim. You can play and unlock any mech and upgrades. Excellent combat system. Australian servers are back up!For the short term its a fun game with great strategy, hopefully in the long term the player base grows as the new devs take the reigns and help the game to flourish!
