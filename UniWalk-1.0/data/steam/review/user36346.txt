Epic game especially for alpha it is very fun lots of clans which is good. I was with friends roaming around chernarus and let me tell you it was amazing!! We took out other clans help bambis. If rocket finishes the game with the same atmosphere but more it will be my in top 5 games!!
10/10 IGN for best napoleonic wars community and....It's almost harvesting season and that's a nice head you have on your shoulders
Whilst everyone was 'hyped' about to sequel to CA's invincible Rome: Total War, I was patient. I didn't rush ahead and pre-purchase a game that could be either really impressive or unstable/un-playable. Coincidently it turned out upon release that the game was terrible (cough* cough* rushed by SEGA as evident in other titles cough* cough* COH2). So i waited; regulary reading reviews, watching gameplay and dev changelogs. I then purchased the game when the emperor editon was released. Instantaniously, the ratio of positive and negative reviews was leaning towards the positive approach. So i purchased the game  with the Greek states DLC on a steam sale Sepember last year for a great price of $20.At that point in which i purchased the game i was impressed, beautiful graphics, animations and mechanics which were not exactly historically accurate but were enjoyable and rewarding. If i had any negative comeents at this current stage, it would be the numerous overpriced DLCs which i believe was influenced by SEGA (cough* cough* COH2 has the same issue). Another complaint is the weakness of the Greek Hoplite/Pike phalanx. I do not like the fact that sword beats the dori phalanx as historically if a unit collided head on with a phalnx, they would become what is known as the modern day souvlaki. I rate this game 92/100 at its CURRENT stage.
iTS awesome XD
