This game has a great atmoshpere to it, the graphics are amazing and it's crafting system is very simple but some materials are scarce so you must go deeper to find them. overall i rate the game 7/10 (it's still in early access so i can't give a full rating)
Its really good but they should add steam workshop for easier Mod downloading. PEACE
The games awesome with all the mods and everything but i wish it would have the steam workshop and easier server creating like in space Engineers or something but overall i would rate it somthing like a 8/10
i got hacked and someone stole my key best 30 bucks spent ever. :(
