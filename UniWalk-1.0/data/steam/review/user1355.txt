You haven't played DotA 2 yet? Well, what are you waiting for? Click that damn install button. I could go on forever talking about how amazing this game is, but I simply don't have the time. So what I will say, is that you cannot have Steam, and not play, or at least try this game.
Trine 2 is a beautiful game with truely amazing detail to the levels and backgrounds. The gameplay is extremely creative and that you can do anything using the three heroes, from making boxes and planks to jump on, to grappeling yourself and doing circus acts, to charging your way through boulders and throwing Thor-like hammers. In my opinion, this game is best experienced with a friend. I highly recommend this game to anyone.
