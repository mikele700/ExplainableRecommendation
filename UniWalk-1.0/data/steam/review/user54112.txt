Highly addictive rhythm based action game, which successfully combines two of the greatest things in the world, ever: Prog Rock and Gaming.  Excellent title!
Quite simply one of the most playable, fun, epic shooters ever.  Single player is a blast, multi-player is phenomenal, and the effort to grab the best loot in the game adds a surprising but welcome level of depth to the proceedings.The DLC is absolutely essential though, and unlike many other games, it's priced perfectly (well, ok, maybe not the extra classes, a little pricey for what they are) and along with the extra game modes only enhances what is already a great experience.  In an age where Â£44.99 usually buys you a game with two hours of solo play, and infinite but boring multiplayer options, Borderlands 2 still effortlessly manages to enthrall, engage and entertain, playthrough after playthrough.Did I mention it's also one of the funniest games ever?It's big, clever and a work of insane genius.  Buy it!
