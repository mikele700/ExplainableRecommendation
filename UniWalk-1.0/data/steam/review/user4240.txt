I can without a doubt. This game exceeded my expectations. But alas, I was spoiled by falloutnv, we all were. All the quests. All the content. Juicy juicy content. All the rpg elements. The feeling of being the bad guy when you side with Caesar and destroying both ncr and legion after lonesome road. No voiced protagonist. On its own. 9/10 for me. But compared to falloutnv. 7/10. But compared to fallout 3, 10/10. Plz no hate
