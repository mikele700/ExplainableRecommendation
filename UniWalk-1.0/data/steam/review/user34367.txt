saw a lady with 4 ♥♥♥♥. time to play.
this game is quite in depth and delicate. so many factors to consider and this makes the game very interesting. originaly i bought it because i thought it would be like age of empires or dawn of war,  butt it turns out it's sort of like a mega complicated tycoon game. it's pretty cool
This game is enjoyable butt once you get to tier 1 then there's not really anything else to do. this game gets updates often so it does get more and more fun though, :3
So many chests to open and look at. My favourite would be Moxxi's
