I was really keen on playing this game, I couldn't wait to give it a go! It has a really unique atmospher to it, the story and character designs are beautiful and the part I love most is how it also educates you with Alaska Native stories, which relate to what part you're playing in Never Alone, the more you progress through it, the more interesting cultural insights you unlock! You don't see much games like this, which is why it's pretty sweet to play something different.But unfortunately, to me, it has more negatives than positives such as having unresponsive controls, which is absolutely frustrating to deal with since you have to switch between two different characters fairly quickly at most parts. When one of them has been attacked, you instantly die - it'd be nice if you had a chance to at least get back up and try again instead of just dying and going straight to the last checkpoint (this annoys me a lot mostly because having pretty unresponsive controls and constantly dying in one hit tends to result in repeating that certain part a few times). Controlling the Bola can be difficult because it doesn't aim properly most of the time, you have to click the right spot for it to not bug up the aim; speaking of bugging up the aim, there's a fair amount of bugs in this game that definitely need to be fixed, the game bugged a few times for me when I jumped onto the ground or onto a wall then suddenly died or became glitched in a spot (using the Artic Fox, unsure about Nuna though).Probably playing local co-op would be best.(Sorry if I didn't word this review properly, it was hard to put in words)
I never thought this game would spark my interest but damn, it definitely did and I love everything about it!
This is one heck of an amazing game, everything about it honestly has left me speechless
ya it's hella fun
