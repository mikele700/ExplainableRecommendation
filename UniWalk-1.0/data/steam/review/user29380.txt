Story: One of the best RPGs of all time, IMO. Shut up I love it. :PMechanics: A broken mess, but a FUN Broken Mess XDGraphics: amazing for the time. Now? OH DEAR GOD THE PIXELS AAAAAAAHHHHMusic: PSX - 11/10. PC - -10e79.2/10. (Seriously. first thing you need to do is install Roses and Wine.)Overall: 3/10, 8/10 with RaW installed.
Graphically? Hasn't aged well. AT ALL.Mechanically? BEST.GAME.EVER.
Marlow Briggs makes Kratos Look like a CHUMP. Also HILARIOUS. In the GOOD way!(also, Best Comedy evil villain EVER)
