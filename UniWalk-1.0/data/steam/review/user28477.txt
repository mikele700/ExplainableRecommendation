My Playtime speaks for itself. But in case you can't see that, or can't be bothered, It is an amazing game. Haven't played too much but I have got 347 hours so far.
Changes name of game repeatedly to hide negative reviews. Steals assets. Fires dev team before game release. Nice. Maybe he'll rename the game again to hide all these negative reviews too.
The first month of this game is nothing but people abusing you while you attempt to learn a game that has a learning curve steeper than almost any other. However once you get a basic understanding and you start to improve, this game becomes quite enjoyable, although still rather salty at the same time.
