Really, really enjoyed this game. The first time I got it I never played it for about 1 year, then I had nothing else to played so I tried it out again. Turns out it acutally went from a boring old game to one of my favourite and most played game. This game supports all kind of gameplay, you can just mess around with friends and gain a good laugh, you can play by your self and feel great when you accomplish a mission, you can play online and meet a great and enjoyable community and the list goes on. Overall a great game and well worth a shot.
