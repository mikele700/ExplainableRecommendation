Absolutely amazing game. I've played all linear Civilization games save for Civ 2 and this has by far been my favourite. I really wish they didn't stray from the feel of the first 3 Civ games, I'm really not a fan of the feel of Civ 5, but alas the masses seem to disagree with me. I don't want the bland interface of the fourth and fifth games, I want character, and my loyal advisors to guide me.I don't want to set my political civic 'Police State' and my economic civic to 'Central Planning'; I don't want to take whatever 'social policy' tree (with permanent effects + no drawbacks) or adopt the 'Order' ideology.I want to use the 'Communism' government and have my advisors refer to me as 'Comrade' as I free to the proletariat of the world from the bourgeosie and the 'Fascist' Aztecs!The character of the game, the way events and history play out, managing your empire and waging war, etc. is simply really something and it really seems to have been lost with the new Civ games. And the sad thing is, it has so much potential for future games with more fleshed-out content, features, etc.Definite 9/10
