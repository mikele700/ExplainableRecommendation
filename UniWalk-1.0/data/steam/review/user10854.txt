Guessing Steam's gonna make us wait until 10 AM Pacific Daylight Time until we can access the DLC, seeing as that's when they tend to update things. I'm beginning to think they consider 10 AM PDT as the start of their broadscast day. No matter. That Epic Fetus + Loki's Horns + Mom's Knife synergy Edmund showed on his Twitter is enough for me to wait. SPIRAL KNIFE EXPLOSIONS!!
