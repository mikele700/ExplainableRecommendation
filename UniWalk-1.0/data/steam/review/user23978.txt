Pick your weapon of choice and hack, slash, smash and/or bludgeon your way through your enemies. Multiplayer is the main focus of the game, single player bots are horrible. A little buggy but great visuals and overall gameplay. On a side note: be wary of archers.
Quite easily one of the best FPS games out there. Nothing beats machine gunning hordes of Russian troops or Banzai charging American defences through the cover of smoke. 10/10 would bang.
