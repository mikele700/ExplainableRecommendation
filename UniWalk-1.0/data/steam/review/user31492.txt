Great game, very interesting and a awesome ending 9- 1/2 out of ten!
No More Room In Hell is a 2011, zombie RPG kinda game: 'When there-'s no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.- Can be good at times, but then it can be annoying and chunky too. Like the feeling of 10 zombies all chasing behind you,slowly, as you limb away with a bleeding leg is awesome! But when you turn around to fight them, thats when it gets chunky. The hit detection is very unaccurate and my charcters takes FOREVER to recover from a weak swing from a damn monkey wrench! So it definatly is very cool at times but its just best to run away. I must say guns are very good though, limited ammo and bullets are rare to find as well as the gun itself! Great game overall, i suggest giving it a try! But remember, -When there-'s no more room in hell- The dead will come for YOU...
