A tricky puzzle game that is meant to be short but had me giving-up & re-starting at least 5 times, lol.The art is a nice B&W style that i really liked, even though it was fairly simple. The sound is good as well, being used as puzzles at times.I ended up using a walkthrough, & i still got really stuck on the 4th puzzle where u need to match the tone. I'm not sure if the walkthrough helped for that or if i just got lucky. It's FREE & has Achievement's (which are easy when using the already-mentioned walkthrough).The guide i used: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=663174341
Shan Gui is only the 2nd VN that i-'ve tried (i didn-'t like the 1st one i tried), & i thought it was fairly good.It was very cheap ($1.50 on sale), & it-'s also on some -Easy 100% Perfect Games- list-'s that i-'ve seen. So there-'s a couple of reasons to try it.The story (which i won-'t go into), was cute, but nothing special. It did have a little (kinda predictable) surprise at the end though. It was a resonabe story, only lasting around 40min-'s, but it was a relaxing & entertaining 40min-'s. The story also had Wikipedia-Links for some of the more famous landmarks & legends mentioned during the story, which i thought was a nice touch, & helped give history & tourist info to the non-chinese reader/player (?).The art was similarly adequate, but not awe-inspiring. Manga style still pics of character models were nice, but nothing flashy. While oil-paint type background pics, would show the landscapes mentioned in the story.Overall, i liked Shan Gui, even though it had no direct player/reader (?) interaction other than clicking when wanting to read a new line of text, & advance the story. I-'m not sure what the full-price is, but it was definatly worth the $1.50 that i paid. Even though it was under 1hr of play/read (?) time, i liked what i was given, & would even buy a sequel if there is one. So if ur not sure about VN-'s, try this with an open mind & u might b as surprised as i was.
A FREE Visual Novel about Making (or not making) Oatmeal/ Porridge.The story was pretty good, & i was interested to see how many different ways the character would succeed or fail at oatmeal/ porridge making (10 endings BTW).Having never really suffered from Anxiety, i couldn't really relate to that, but i have made oatmeal/ porridge heaps of times, so i totally understood where she was coming from in that regard.Watching socially awkward girl, making packet oatmeal/ porridge. 6/10.My Mrs. makes home-made Apple & Sultana Porridge all the time. 10/ 10.
I haven't found either of these characters yet, but since they were free, i'll recommend getting it. If they are totally hopeless & make the game worse when using them in your party, i'll change my review, but if it's not changed, then they're not crap.& they are free, so if you don't like them you can play without the DLC or just dump them somewhere in-game i guess.
