This game is an amazing new chapter in the story of the land of Ehb. It takes the classic gameplay of Dungeon Seige one and adds many new features. I definetly recommend this game to fans of the first!P.S. In my opninion the third game is a trap and should not be called Dungeon Seige III
In this game you can point and click to kill people, and win a free iPhone*! It also features many great maps including Dust II and Dust II. This game can be very difficult for new players as it features people who are really good, they can get running head shots with an ak-47 from CT to B double doors on the best map, Dust II. It also features a skin system similar to TF 2's item system but skins aren't really usefull they just look nice, and allow you to show off how much money you can throw at people. *No iPhones can actually be won from playing this game, major rage and saddness may occur, please seek a medical proffesional before deciding to use this product.
Do you hate yourself? Do you like 2D platformers? if so **** you and buy this game!
Fantastic game, stunning mechanics, immersive worlds and amazing customisations. I have been playing this game since the closed alpha and have loved every minute of it, if your looking for a good Free-To-Play FPS then this is the game for you!
