So far, this game is amazing. The gameplay mechanics is what we waited many years for, the perfect combat mixed with the perfect stealth and the perfect parkour. All of that in the beautiful city of Paris fully re-imagined.Performance-wise, there may be some small issues, but that should not stop you from enjoying the game. It still performs incredibly well for the content it has. The crowds feel so much alive, the city never feels dead as it could sometimes in previous games.The storyline is also what people wanted: a new Ezio mixed with the suffering of Connor and the wiseass comments from Edward. The cast, performing together, make this game feel like a book coming to reality along with the many references to French Culture, specially books like the Three Musketeers and others from Dumas. Definitely worth picking up.
