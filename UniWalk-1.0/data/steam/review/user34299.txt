It's a good game it is good for people who really want to play competitively and people who aren't a fan of the COD franchise.I very much recomend it ot any player, if you are new to FPS gmaes well you should try this out but before you get into competitive i recomend learning the basics in Deathmatch or Casual or if you have friends that have played or play this game ask them for tips. Well taking the time for reading my review hope you liked it.:DDD
