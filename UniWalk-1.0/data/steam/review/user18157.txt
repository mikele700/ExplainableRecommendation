it's complete trash and makes me want to die.10/10
this game gave me terminal cancer10/10
I feel ashamed to have this many hours on this game.I was 12 once don-'t judge me. Pretty much this game is a Crack Addict simulator. Everyone wants to get a little hit of crack, but in the case of this game, crack is actually Hats.12 year olds jump up and down trying to get hats and  ruin a pretty decent game. Besides all the ♥♥♥♥ing hats it-'s not bad. But you know, Gaben loves his ♥♥♥♥ing microtransactions so have fun with your -Free- game guys. You ♥♥♥♥ing crack addicts. But without the hats and microtransactions, it-'s not a bad game tbh.
its ok
Never have i found, a game better than this. The sheer amount of cancer, brings a tear to my eye. Not only am i getting money for the refund, I am suing the company who is responsible for this, to pay my chemotherapy bills.
♥♥♥♥ing dodgey as ♥♥♥♥ cancer game. absolute trash dont ever buy.8.3/10 -IGN
