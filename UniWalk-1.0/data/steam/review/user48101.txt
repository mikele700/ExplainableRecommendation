CS:GO Is a great game to play, its a shooter, its team-based, its slow paced. What more would you want? THE ONLY THING ABOUT CSGO IS, PLAY WITH FRIENDS, It only makes the game more exciting. CS:GO is extremely competitive, most people dont like that but that is the reason I like CS:GO.
Team Fortress 2 is I would have to say, one of the most creative FPS game out there. It is soo cleverly designed and well done. It takes time to get used to I would definitely admit but after a week playing you cant stop. The fact that Team Fortress 2 is not competitive and that its free, its a awesome game!
