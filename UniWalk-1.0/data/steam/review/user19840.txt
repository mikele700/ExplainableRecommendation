this game seemed like a great concept 2 years ago, but 2 years in early acess isn't all that reassuring that it won't end up like a game similar to starforge, which would be nice but seeing is that it's still in EA bothers me
How Bout No Hundreds of things were promised the game still needs to undergo Optimization, The Game makes it immpossible to Progress, ARk your better off Getting ARk Survival Evolved it's 100 Times better than this and even expands on the basics, i have survived longer on ARK with dinosaurs chasing me then i have with Falling Through the Map.......OverALL DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless for 2:50 or lower, I think this group who made this game made reign of kings Do not buy that either because you will be disspointed with the same reult and unfinished buggy game still in early access, honestly i have no idea how this made it out of early access.
