I lie if I say just one word sums this game up, this game is the most heart wrenching, emotional games ever created, imagine every game at that moment everyones loved charcter dies, this is the entire game, the jokes in here are the only thing keeping you from bursting into tears. No matter how tough you think you are, this game softens you to the core. This game is positively one of my favourite games ever made. Despite the short lenght and somewhat easy puzzles, this game focuses on the story which is a truly beautifully written one. 10/10 don't know how many more times I would play this but I could forever.
