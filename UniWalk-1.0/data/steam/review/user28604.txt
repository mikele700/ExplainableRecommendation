There are a few day 1 issues going on with performance aswell as some quality of life bugs such as turns hanging on for a few seconds more then they should, but if your-'re willing to put up with that for a day or 2 you will be treated to one of the most compelling and deep turn based strategy game we-'ve gotten in a  good long while and its only set to get better thanks to a HUGE commitment to mod support by the developer. 10/12 would bang agien (however if you dident like EU / EW and preferd the orignal Xcom games then this game isent for you either)EDIT: a day or 2 is starting to look like a week before we get anything more then a -we are looking into it- so yea. not changing the recommendation however if you despise frame drops and dealing with bugs then id hold off, i-'ll update this review as needed
developers abandoned an unfinished game, do not trust these devlopers on futher early funding schemes
this game is so god dam finished it has less bugs then many tripple A games that get realeased now day (im looking square at you unity) but to be fair thier are balance issues with certin layouts being the optimal stratagy and also the dev has said that the drugs feature hasent realy got the effect on your prisons he would like to see. but still this game is rich in content and if you have any enjoymnent for sim like games were you set the peramiters and see how the AI reacts to it, your going to loose potentialy hundreads of hours.
if you enjoyed games like left 4 dead and thought -you know what i wish the zombies had guns- and -this is fun but the objectives dont realy require anything other then pressing f once and waiting untill somthing happens- then you-'ll like this game. there are objectives like that but many more involve a more teamwork like approcach, a good example of this is a mission wereby you must hack the right computer but you dont know which one has the file you need so your buddy needs to spam a computer on the other side of the building to make a small error message appear on the correct computer and someone else needs to find said error message.the game also has a good proggresion system that doesent lock out low level players (within reason of coure your not doing the hardest possible mission at level 6) with a skill tree that works like most rpg like talent trees. however there are some talents that realy arent a choice becuase there right at the bottem of the trees and make everything you do better (a skill that lets you  bag loot faster for instance is a must have on almost every heist). im not gonna lie the dlc is quite the minefeild to get through but take heart in the fact that the weapon and charecter dlc is preety optional (sniper rifles and rpgs are usualy only needed on the hardest of hardcore missions) and the hesit dlcs have a great buisness model, you can still play them you just cant host them.all and all this game understands what it means to be a co-op game and not just a single player shooter with 3 other players on the side (nudge nudge borderlands) and if your worried about the devs abandoning the game, this game realeased late 2013, and last month we got a 7 day event were each day we get free dlc, and we just got word that the publisher will support this game for the next 2 years, so jump in now the waters fine and its set to only get better
at time of writing ive played this game longer then anyone else whos made a review, so my opinion can be considerd 100% unrefuatble factseriously though the games alright, its about 1-2 hours of gravity puzzles, if those 2 words dont click with you then you wont like it, and even if they do it gets abit samey. however if you have 3 dollars in your steam wallet and you want those dollars to go towards somthing then i can heartly recomend this game
