Beyond Earth has a great setting and some very interesting ideas, however it-'s VERY similar to Civ V and just has a feeling of being incomplete (like only having 8 leaders). Also some parts are just confusing like the -web- shaped tech tree. It-'s a cool idea but they really need a tutorial to show some possible paths.I -would- recommend Beyond Earth, but only when there-'s a sale or some DLC is released.
A charming game made by the same developer as To The Moon. Everything in the game is shown through character animations, thought bubbles and music (there's no text) and I found myself smiling a lot while playing it.Downsides are it's short and there isn't that much gameplay, but it's cheap and very well made. I'd recommened it if you like story focused games.
A charming puzzle game made by the same developers of Castle Crashers. Solid gameplay, a great artstyle and hilarious commentary makes this game definitely worth your time. Also it's two player so you can punch your friends.
