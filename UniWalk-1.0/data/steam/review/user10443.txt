I have put a fair chunk of my time from release over the years. I have purchased almost all DLC, so I have spent over $100 on the game. In all my time gaming I have never seen a community so willing to support a developer. However, adding ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t p2w microtransactions, after the developer said they would not, after I have spent more than double a triple A title, was the final straw for me. GG Pay2day, it was nice knowing you...
