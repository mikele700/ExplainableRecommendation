Ever wanted to kill your friends?Of course you have.Get this game for you and your friends and never have a friendship again
Tf2 is a good game that i took to enjoying straight away, i recommend it if you are patient and enjoy playing game with your friends. Me and my friends enjoy this game and i am willing to help new players (add me and i wll help you when I can). Overall a game that i would rate at 9/10
This is a good game, but there are plenty of problems. I really enjoyed coh1 because there were so many diffrent ways to play, each game, faction and map were unique in a diffrent way. Coh2 removes the variety of each game, theres no digging in and playing defensivley as the maps are open with nearly no choke points. Well to get to the point:Pros;Definatley better graphics (Don't hate)Winter map varietyGood length campaignWestern fronts improves the game a bit by adding a little more varietyThe British have arrived :DCons;No proper German campaignNo real chance of winning if playing defensiveTank spam!!!Limited Variety of nearly everythingOverpriced DLCS and plenty of DLCS that should have been added in the begginingSTILL NO GERMAN CAMPAIN :(
This game is good, broken in areas, but good none the less. The devs have done a few things wrong, but the've done quite a few things right. Many people think the game is P2W, but its not, you can pay for fancy weapons and tanks etc, but money can't buy you the means of how to use them effectivley. The biggest problem is the fact that for me to get as far as I have, i've had to grind through many battles that have gone many ways, when I could have spent probaly 10$. I choose to time grind because you learn the game through playing it, rather than spending money on the game.Pro's;Instead of K/D being the deciding factor in a battle, it's your teams ability to cap, defend and work togetherThere are a variety of soldiers with diffrent rolesThere is an interesting strategic map & Stratergy side for time grinding or money spending players ie, GeneralsVery interesting arsenal of weapons and vehiclesYou can ride a buckin Bike XDTheres a town called Condom, check southern France :)Cons;American stuff is OP >.<American players not knowing what there doingNew players treating this like codFactions being completly seperate in terms of vehicles, weapons and charactersNo incentive to change sides
A game that will test you to your limits...A steady hand and nerves of steel are nescassary to take on the legions of Hitlers undead...Hordes upon Hordes of Hitlers Zombies will swarm your defences...Biting, swinging, battering and sniping...The only definately way to end them? Aim for the head...Of course no army exsists without there elites, and Hitlers Legions have plenty...Wielding either a crimson covered chainsaw or a vicious Mg42, they can tear unorginized teams of survivors into piles of blood, flesh and bones in seconds...But the elites may pale in comparison to the horrors that roam the ruins of Berlin and Germany...Despicable Summoners that not only summon zombies out of the ground, they also ressurect the zombies that you recently sent back to the graves...Burning Incendiary Zombies that can create large and sudden groups of burning, running, enraged zombies...Skeletons decked in corrupted armor...Occult Generals who can summon entire armies of the undead on a whim...But don't despair my fellow survivors...A wide range of rifles, sub-machine guns, pistols and explosives are at your disposal to dispatch Hitlers undead...Always try to stay a step ahead of the undead, or you may end up as another corpse in Hitlers decaying lands...I now bid you farewell, happy hunting on mainland Europe, we're all couting on YOU, to end this madness.  Verdict;Stunning Remasters of the original gamesThe third campaign dosen't pale in the face of the other two games/campaign'sHuzzah for the implementation of the stompNut shotting zombiesHitler ZombieI reccomend this game, but not to those who can't handle gore very well, this is very gory (and satanic):P
I spent an entire game punching sheep to death10/10
