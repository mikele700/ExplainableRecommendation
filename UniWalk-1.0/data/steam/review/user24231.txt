I-'m going to start of by saying, this is not a -rouge-like-. It may have perma death, but this is more of a gambling RPG game, everything you do is a gamble. Some people may find this fun, but most people that like a challange will hate this game because unless you want to challange your ability to get RNGesus on your side, the level of skill vs the level of randomness makes this game feel like punishment. It may be fun because of its -hardness- but that-'s only if you enjoy getting hours in, only to have to make a new game because its been a up-hill battle from the begining, and your luck will never change.
Run an instance 6 timesSame useless item called Talt 6 times in a row.Makes me question why i play this game at all.Uninstall.Not to mention the insane problems that ruin this games community, trading, grouping, loot drops, hackers, abuse of megaphones to spam gold farmers, and a paywall to do basically anything MMO based. Honestly fix your game... This is not an MMO its a singleplayer game with some people running around.
even when you do the right thing in this game it finds a way to ruin your playthrough.. gg DS3 adventure is dead
I love it.
