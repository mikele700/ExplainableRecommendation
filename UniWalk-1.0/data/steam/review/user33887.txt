This game feels a lot like warface in the sense that it's a shooter with classes and unlockable rewards with the addition of micro transactions, which is great! This game however feels like the creators stopped making the game two months into creating it. The graphics are atrocious, the controls are awkward and the gunplay just never feels right, I can get two shot by an smg from a mile away where my sniper whcih says it deals 100 damage (the same amount of hp as a player) body shots FOR 100 damge but the enemy I shot is left with 1 health. Another point to make is that I understand these free games need to make money but making people have to pay money for grenades is just stupid. The higher classes lay waste to the recruit classes and shotguns can destroy from any range (any). It plays very much like an unfinished game. Therefore I dislike this game, I like what it's trying to do (Warface genre) but It misses it's target by so much that it basically gave up on aiming!
