just from the get go, the voice acting is poorly cut together, the characters are unrealistic and depressing and this game looks to be a bleak way to spend an afternoon.
Same ♥♥♥♥, Different Badguy. This game at least has some brutal humour.
Worth the $2 i payed for it.
Great for tracking your budget. your income and expenses can be tracked easily and categorised. The main downside is the lack of tracking capability for investments.
