This game is one of the best Zombie Survival games i have played in a long time i think it is a good game to play even if you hate pve there is Pvp online or if u hate PvE But the bad things about this is the zombies move way to fast and it can kinda be hard to get Experiance but other than that the game is AWESOME i rate 150 player heads out of 200 player heads
Okay So Before i ♥♥♥♥ all over this game i would just like to say.... waste of timeDownloaded Launched it saw the Loading Screen was like ♥♥♥♥ yeah looks pretty cool then got into the game saw it walked around then logged out it's laggy looks like utter ♥♥♥♥10/10 would ♥♥♥♥ the Child again
Good game :D
THIS IS EPIC cus i have always loved Starwars and i Lover Starwars battle front 2 on ps2 and Xbox but i wanted it on computer since i did not have any console that i could play it on then i herd it was on PC and i really wanted it i also did not know that steam had it so i looked for 2 and a half years then i looked on steam and it was there right under my nose the hole time it is epic
