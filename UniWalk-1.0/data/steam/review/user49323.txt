If You want a Simulation where 90% of the gameplay is hiking and an amazing splurdge of happiness when you find a can of beans then this is the game for You. Trust me though its brilliant and if you want it then get it now before the price rockets when more variations of tinned food come out (more content too). Brilliant Game 15 out of 15 yogstars for this Bean slurpingly good beta Game.
