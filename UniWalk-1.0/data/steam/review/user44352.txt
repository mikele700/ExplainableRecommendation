This game is amazing, fun to kill time and rage at.
Pretty terrifying but slow to start of :D amazing game for $2.99
This game is bae <3 You it grabs the best bits from minecraft and adds mounts, dungeons, clubs (clans), challenges and many other amazing things. I recommend you play this right this instant.
Took me 5 hours too complete fully, loved it. It was very interesting, as long as all the puzzles to keep you from going bored. I recommend this game if you're sitting at home and want to relax.
