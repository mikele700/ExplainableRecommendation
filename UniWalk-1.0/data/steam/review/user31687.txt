For a short game it has an extremely powerful story. A bit too real for me.
Fun game. Worth every cent. Great with friends.A couple bugs but nothing too bad (even though we lost because of one)
Like War? Like FPS's? Like divebombing players with planes? THEN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU. Heroes and Generals is one of the better War FPS games out there. Sure i havent played much of it, but what I have played I enjoyed every second of it. At the moment the game is a bit glitchy but that is to be expected. I suggest giving the game a go (with friends makes the experience even better).And remember keep your memes fresh.
