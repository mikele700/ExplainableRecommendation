Playing Geometry Dash on the PC is much better than the iPhone 4: the controls are easier, graphics are smoother and I can hear music! Although there are some issues I must express.- Lag in Windowed mode can be a pain- Screen tearing gets the best of me at times- Tutorial still optimised for touch screen devices- Not able to switch keys around that best suit meOther than that this is the best puzzle/platformer game I've played to date!
