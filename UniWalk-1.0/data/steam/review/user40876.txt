Its so awesome
Childhood is back *sniff sniff*
Must try this game, enjoyed it heaps, I've had it for ages and never gets old as there are endless possibilities to what you can do, single player and multiplayer
Its alright i guess, you probably get teleported onto the ship from black mesa. Like in blue shift they use a teleporter.
