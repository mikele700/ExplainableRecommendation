Perpetual Testing Initiative meets Braid World 5.
Phil Fish and everyone else gained a strong detest for each other when this game was taking forever to come out. In fact, most people forgot about it and didn't buy it. But if you liked time ♥♥♥♥, link between worlds, myst or any other puzzle game ever, then you need to pay Fish to give you pixels.
10/10 would get killed by a lucky shot with no training again
Never before has it been possible to spoil a game without a story.
