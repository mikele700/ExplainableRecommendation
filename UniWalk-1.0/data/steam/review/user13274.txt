This game, this, game. IS. SO. ♥♥♥♥ING. AMAZING. (I hate Aria though) BUT I AM NOT ANGRY ABOUT IT, I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE THIS GAME, THE MUSIC, THE RYTHM, EVERYTHING, AMAAAAZIIIIIING!!!!!
This dlc is by far the best I have seen in any game, it brang so much more potential and I honestly think it was great. New music (Which I LOVE) A few new bosses, new items which are amazingly useful, and the best of all, GREED MODE! I love doing runs on greed mode these days, I've tried doing it with every character but alas was not successful. I rate this dlc 9/10. I would definitely recommend buying it. It is worth the money.
