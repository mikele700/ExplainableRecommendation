A fast-paced FPS, this is the game you all have been waiting for. Combining Call-of-Duty-esque gameplay mechanics and awesome concept, this game has hooked many and retained even more. Playing as a pilot inside a giant -mech-, players run around, shoot, and generally try to blow each other-'s heads off. While the upgrade path is leaning towards pay-to-play, it is not impossible to unlock everything with just game time, but expect to put a load of hours in. All-in-all, an amazing game for it-'s price (haha) but with a slightly unfair upgrade system, this is a game you should not go past. A solid 8.5/10.
Well,This isn't a BAD game as such. I've played it through twice, and the ending is always the same boring grind. Chapters 1-4 are extremely egaging on the first play-through, but it becomes obvious how forced the story is when you play it through the second time. The chat mechanic makes you feel sort of in control of the story, but again, on the second play-through you realise how little the choices you make actually matter to the overall narrative. The game concept is very good, but as with all text-based games the story needs to be STRONG, and if you're gouing to implement a choice mechanic it would be nice if it actually did something. Overall 6/10, as I did play it through twice, and the first time was engaging enough. If this game was P2P this would be a solid 2/10.
