This game is a waste of your cash, the single player is junk the cut scenes inbetween are just the worst, the graphics drasticly decreases in a cutscene. The meat of the game: Multiplayer is horrid. I get fps lagg at the start of every match on small maps for about 1 of the 10 minutes and gets on my nerves after a while, this happens to me all the time IF I CAN FIND A GAME the ONLY gamemodes you can find is the first two: Mosh pit and Team Deathmatch the rest comes up with No games found and you must proceed to go back to mosh pit with only approx 1-2 games found at a time. I have not tried exo survival and I do not plan on doing so, Fix the multiplayer and this review will become worthless.
Great way to get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at Chinese and Russians that bombard your Australian & American servers because they just simply love getting lagg and hate messages Good one Volvo!
Great, fun addictive game
