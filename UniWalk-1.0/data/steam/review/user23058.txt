So I bought this game as a 4-pack when it was on special earlier these summer sales. I gave the game to my friends and from there on I discovered the wonderful world that is Torchlight 2. I played the game so much in the first 3 days I managed to hit NG++.Only 20 hours on this game and every second of that was pure fun. ...The true successor to Diablo II10/10
