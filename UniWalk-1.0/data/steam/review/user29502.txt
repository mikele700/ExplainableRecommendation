Can be the manliest Nord and still wear a dress 11/10 would wear womens clothing again.
It started with me washing up on the beach, I was annoyed when I figured out where I was because this was around the 7th time Ive spawned in this area (east coast). So I started walking I found myself a good backpack and an axe. Then I started to get supplies, 20minutes later I went walking to a nearby airfield. I was walking there almost at the airfield when I saw a container carrier (this big ship with containers scattered around it). I went searching through it when I saw a bodie, this man had an assualt rifle, a magnum and a 45. pistol. I felt sorry for the guy, but that didnt stop me taking his guns (I had a 60round clip for the M4) and his stab-vest. Then it hit me, the killer might be here so I went cautiously around the ship. I didnt find anyone so I went off to the airfield again. I finnaly got there and I was right someone had/is here so I went searching (with the m4 ready) and found a better vest, a helmet, a gasmask and some more clips for my M4.Finnaly I went to the hanger....and found the killer waiting there so I shot him dead..but the weird thing was that he got off ONE bullet and I died. So there you have it, My Little adventure in DayZ. Share yours in the comments below. Oh and thanks for reading this! I rate this game 10/10! It will leave you scarred and hopeful for thsoe beans. Watch out for rabbits though, their fiesty!
As the title says, Pepare To Die (A LOT).
Now I know War of the Vikings is out but, this is its predecsor ( although its in the future ) it is an amzing game with amazing graphics, gameplay and cutomization (infinite possiablities for your soldier). It truly is a game worth your $20
