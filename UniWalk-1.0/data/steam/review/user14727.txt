If you like war sims, or just like the tactics of one or just can't run Arma, then this game is for YOU!
You can throw knife in friendly's croutches to make them look like purnuses, I like it! :D
Simple review:Campaign was a little predictable but still quite good.Mulitplayer feels a bit too easy to die and you feel quite cheated when you die if you have low ping, But still very addictive
I've played about 3min and it's already pretty amazing.
