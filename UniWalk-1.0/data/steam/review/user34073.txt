I know it's quite late to review Garry's Mod, cos pretty much everyone knows what it is nowadays, but I still want to state my opinion.What do I think of this game? IT'S AWESOME!I'm the type of guy who loves indie games, for the freedom, not having to be restricted to a specific task. Garry's Mod is one of those games. In it, you get to do whatever you want, whenever you want, wherever you want, however you want! I can guarantee the most popular part is the workshop. The mods that users have uploaded there are amazing. From Minecraft gamemodes to Five Nights At Freddy's NPC's, to Shrink guns to horror maps. The possibilities are endless! One of my favourite parts are the different tools that are included. With different tools such as the Camera, Face Poser, Finger Poser, Inflator and more, I've been able to make quite a few animations. You may have seen quite a few famous animations that were made in Garry's Mod, such as The Last Wave by ARMaster, or a more recent one, Friendly Foxy by NoobMister. They were brilliantly made in Garry's Mod!Definitely worth the money, whether you want to animate, test out mods, or just generally screw around!
