Brilliant campaign, awesome co-op that really stresses your mind!
Team Fortress 2 is a fun first-person shooter which can easily improve teamwork among others. I wish I could say that, but everyone cares about hats instead. But that's ok because TF2 can get away with things like this. No reason why, just because it's TF2
