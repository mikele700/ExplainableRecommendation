Without spoiling anything, let me give you a basic summary of each run:- Neutral Run - The one you do the first time you play- True Pacifist - World's most effective feels trip- Gencide Run - Bad Time Simulator 201XSeriously though, get this game. It is well worth your $10.The Soundtrack is amazingThe gameplay is really uniqueThe characters are witty and well writtenEverything is just amazing
Oh wow. Wow. This game is awesome.Don't ready any more reviews, just play this game. It's short a hell, but the ending is very interesting, and something I've definitely never seen before.Also, the graphics look like they're from the original Wolfenstien. Overall just an awesome game!
Pros- Beautiful environments and graphics, looks like a painting most of the time.- Amazing writing and voice acting.- Great gameplay.- Most of the story is very interesting and engaging.Cons- Very short and a bit overpriced, only takes about 3 hours to finish.- The ending sucks.Suggestions- Add some more content. Not DLC (unless it's free), actually just update the game and add something.- Improve the graphics a little. Don't change how it looks, but maybe use Sunshine on the asset store to add some volumetric light or something.- Add some wildlife to the environment. It'll just make it feel a bit more alive.If you're looking into getting the game, you really should. But only buy it if it's on sale or you have a discount, because it's not worth the full price.
