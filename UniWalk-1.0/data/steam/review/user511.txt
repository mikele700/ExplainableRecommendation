Super addictive- never gets old!
One of the most intense, action packed games ever.
Hell yeah!
8.5/10! - Action packed and challenging. Although, It would be nice to see multiplayer come into it sooner or later.
Great game! Would recommend to any people who love survival/horror games like the forest. Here are some key points that I love and hate.Pros:-The game looks great on ultra-Islands are loaded with useful items such as: Palm Trees, Yucca plants (which produce lashings, also known as rope) and more.-Sharks are bloody aggressive since hot fix 0.02.-Ship wrecks are awesome.-Quite realistic.Cons:-As it is in the Pre-Alpha stages (obviously) it lacks content. Even though it is an infinite world, there is only a handful of items avaliable to the players.-Glitches galore!Great game in general though.
