Piece of Crap
This is a game I've intended to buy for years but had never done so due to all of the various issues the game was well known for. 95% of the issues have been fixed and the Game is truly fantastic for it
Have played this game since before Hardmode, spent at least one hundred and fifty hours offline at that stage and loved it, Is definitely worth Your money, Thank you Dev's
