This game is a perfect game for tryhards. Since it involves alot of thinking, your friendly neighbourhood tryhard will look up on the interweb -Ultimate tic tac toe strategy-. I haven-'t done it you have no proof. Unfortunatly the game mechanics are too random for your average win strat.We got fading mechanics which are way too realistic for this world, like why do they fade at the most convienient time.Okay so to wrap it all up. Its like tic tac toe meets another game of tic tac toe so that makes 2 sets of tic tac toethen you times it by 4 and plus 1 and there you have it. Your 4 times table.Oh yeah the game, It-'s actually pretty good but it just breaks my brain
