Truly one of the best mods i have played great controls, amazing map design, amazing voice acting, classes,Teams, and so much more truly a must get mod. Only one problem the players it seems that the new people dont know much of the controls and therefore get easily beaten by veterans.
I strongly recommend this game if you are into the diablo sty fighting game i love the castle build its fantastic the way you can collect loot from your friends castle is amazing. But i wish they just put in more content like when your friend is attacking your castle you can attack them. This game had so much potential but i hope in the future updates they will add more content in the game itself and possibly bring multiplayer.
