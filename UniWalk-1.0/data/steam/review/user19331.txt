The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is another great addition to the Elder Scrolls series. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an epic adventure involving dragons monsters and magic. You can sink heaps of time into this game. When you think your done, then how 'bout downloading some free mods to add to the experience, and rack up some more time playing this masterpiece.
When I first bought this game I was worried that I wouldn't know what was happening, but the multitude of Casettes that you can listen to give you the backstory of the characters and things that happened in the other games. There really is nothing better than loading up a casette of power pop and creeping around putting fools to sleep.
