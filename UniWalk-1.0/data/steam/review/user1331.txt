saved a man from some bandits, only to be knocked unconscious by the man i saved with a banana... 11/10
This game is very exceptional, always rasing my expectations. this would havee to be one of my favorite scary genre games.this game really does scary the living Sh!t out of you, you cannot attack and you have to be on your piggies everytime because you never really know what behind the corner. this comming with no fighting aspect also makes it challenging by thinking of your next move, what to do, and ultimatly should i really go for it?. Cause half the time you dont know if -it- is coming behind the corner. Some things i do dislike is the the enemies are poorly done, even with such good graphics, the faces are like a raccon attack there face, then again half the time your running away from them XD. the story is good but halfway it starts to chop and change and it can become confusing, also getting trapped in a corner is a proplem-escape is not possible.even with those dislike it is very good, well thought, and stole my sleep.i give it a solid 7/10.
