This is a great and well balanced game for 5 dollars it is an absolute bargin and to top it off it has dedicated Australian servers worth the time and effort and if you like the ghost and shell universe you will be right at home here!
Game looks good you feel really powerful, but not over powered.A little clunky but it is early access would like to see some different spells and perhaps the ability to cast to different elements together to make different effects and combonations but overall not bad at all i am going to keep up with this game as more content comes out feels like might and magic dark massiah
Square is the hardest company to get a hold of the game cant help when i am missing my ID go to web page and asks to reset both password and ID click and ALL IT CHANGES IS THE PASSWORD! go to see how to change the ID and it says i need to speak to someone and the office is closed?!?! this is a MMO support should be 24/7 not when you feel like it. Game is great just dont forget your ID if you go away from it for a while and come back I cant believe i now have to wait for them to contact me over this and devs wonder why Blizzards MMO stays at the top,  SUPPORT IS A BIG PART OF I, hats off to blizzard
Super Sweeeeeet
cant play the damn thing and steam will do nothing to help
