1. Downloaded game2. clicked on one waifu3. got tissues10/10 best game
one of the best FPS games ever made and ive spent countless hours both on PC and XBOX360,and i havent waisted a single moment whilst playing this
if only dating in real life wass this easy.. EITHER WAY I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE THIS GAME
Exactly like school H.P.ENobody passes me the ballI get yelled at for tryingEveryone pushes me aroundI cry from being bullied10/10 would buy again
i really like the game but there are a few things that need improvment such as the optimization and the fps, also the rate your food drops (not so much the water) but i found after i killed a few dodo's i was fine.also maybe try to make the agro range on the raptors a little less because if one spots you HOOOOOLLY crap yor goinna want to run.but all and all its not to shabby and there are a few bugs but its only in early access so i cant wait to see what changes are to come :D
