Play this game, or the gaming world will disown you. It is a simple as that.
It easily is the best, true to it's genre (Total War is part turn-based so it doesn't count), Real Time Strategy game on the planet
You may need a million and one DLC's that cost the price of the actual game, but with or without them the game is still oddly addicting
possibly one of the most fun arcade first person shooters ever made
If you are into strategy, then buy this game, it is a simple as that
