This game deserves a medal for how good it is. I recommend this to people wanting a Minecraft/DayZ kinda game
Finds good houseBurns it down for the lolzFinds new better house not so farGo sleep for 9 hoursWakes up to find fire spreaded to new house11/10 would burn in bed again
I may have died more than I should have but this game was way good even though I couldn't even be a proper assassin
Recommend this to anyone that wants long game full of exploring,killing bosses, collecting every item. At first its confusing but after a while you will undertsand and start crafting highly advanced stuff
Best zombie game out there that isnt P2W
