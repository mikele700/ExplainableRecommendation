This game is the best game i have ever played
This is a great game. Really Wildwest like   pew! pew! pew!   (sry bout wat i type)         But its quite sad that theres no multiplayer......    Still a great game though!!!
Insurgecy is amazing. They did not show u the minimap, healthbar, ammo bar, hip-fire crosshair, spotting n no kill notification. it feels like u r in a real war!!!  Get this game its really challenging n awesome!!
