i dont have this game.
i definatly reccomend this game it is absolutly amazing and it wil even make you tear up 10/10
this game is so amazing, everything about it, especially that ending.would ou kindly do yourself a favour and buy this game.
episode 1episode 1 is not the best but you will find yourself wanting moreepisode 2episode 2 does that with some awesome plot twists and the returns of some of the characters you may remember from the original game and the 400 days dlc
