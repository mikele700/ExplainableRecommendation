Unturned is a very fun and surprisingly intense multiplayer game which I can definately recommend. Find food, clothes, weapons and fight the horde. Make friends or enemies with players and do battle, and construct forts equipt with metal doors, barbed wire, and a maybe personal helepad if you are lucky enough to aquire a helecopter. Unturned is great fun for friends who want to hang out, have fun and kill zombies. I would most recommend playing with a friend or group of friends on a personal or public server. There are plenty to choose from. :) Also props to the devs for consistant updating, performance improvements and bug fixes. New things are added all the time.
Can't wait for Portal 3 later in the year? Then this is the fan made sequal for you! If you thought that Portal 2 was a mind f*ck then thinking with time machine will make your brain explode. With refrences to the original game and portal worthy puzzles with mind-bending mechanics, this game ups the anti for free steam games, awesome!
A really nice, solid game, especially considering it was released in 1998. If you have a friend to play it with, its really fun. I don't recommend you get this game unless you have someone to play it with, so definately go with the 4 pack. Otherwise you'll be stuck dealing with immpossible enemies all by yourself and have no-one to laugh with, only yourself to yell at.
If you want something out of the ordinary, competative challenge with comic book humour and lots of -WTF- moments then Team Fortress 2 is the game for you! A really fleshed out game with good balance and a unique playstyle thanks to the focus on team work and unique class system. These features make for a truly great game to play with your friends, and thanks to valve, ITS FREE! So what are you waiting for? Download it now!
A must for any gamer who wants to be taken seriously, halariously stupid, completely pointless, extremely aggetating, the most fun anyone could possibly have.
