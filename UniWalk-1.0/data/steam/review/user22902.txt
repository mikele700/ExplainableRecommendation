Really good application, but it needs to allow people to add models from the internet. Make sure your camera is decent and has a high FPS before you get this.
Terraria is a game loaded with content and is very fun to play by yourself or with your friends. 44/50
Good sandbox game, that can be modified easily via the workshop to have more content. 48/50
TF2 is a really great game!!! You must try it - its FREE ($$$)! It has some great gamemodes like ctf and vsh and cp. I would give it a 44/50 = REALLY GOOD!
