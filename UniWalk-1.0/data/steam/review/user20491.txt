This game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. So many decisions to be made with so many consequences, and there's no right or wrong.Gotta love Square Enix.
Fun and addictive.
Dammit telltale! Why must you make me make hard decisions!??Excellent game. Definitely worth the play, and I suggest you play Season 1 and load save game.
