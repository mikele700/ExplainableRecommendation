Very fun and challenging, especially with friends. If you're coming off from other fps games such as CoD you'll need to completely adjust your playstyle ://. Interesting and difficult to handle mechanics involved, a must play for anyone who enjoys fps games :DD.
Most people overlook this game, but this game perfectly balances aspects of luck of skill. With a reasonable storyline and nice gameplay, this game definitely earns itself the position of one of the funnest and enjoyable strategy games out there.
Fun in the Sun
It stands out in its own light compared to Minecraft. A lot more action based yet still maintaining a lot of the creative aspects we know and love about Minecraft. If you don't mind the 2D layout, you should definitely give Terraria a try as it won't fail to disappoint, guaranteed :D
