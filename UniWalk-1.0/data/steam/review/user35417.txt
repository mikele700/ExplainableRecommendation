Words can seriously not explain my feelings for this game. First time I played it I was blown away by the sheer mechanics of it. The traps, puzzles and mazes all make up what I have realised to be a game unlike anything else. But most importantly, the combat system. Oh, you would not believe it! This game completely envelopes you and immerses you in the gameplay, making it feel as though you have actually died from boredom!
