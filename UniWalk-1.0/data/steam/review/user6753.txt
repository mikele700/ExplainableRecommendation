This game is absolutely beautiful. Both the art and soundtrack are great, and it also plays really well. Actually dying is surprisingly hard to do so long as you know what you're doing, so that's also a plus.It's a good challenge figuring out which Functions work best together. I usually keep Jaunt() on hand for mobility.This is as much a work of art as it is a gorgeous game.
