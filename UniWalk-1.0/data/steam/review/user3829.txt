Very fast paced game, not very long. You have 3-4 different levels, but you do the same on each: Try to each the otherside whilst jousting your opponent. Great if you have a friend over and want to play a short 2-player game. Not really worth 15$ dollars, wait till it's on sale
This game really did surprise me with its gameplay. Usually WWII games are a bore to me, yet this was not the case for Sniper Elite v2. If you love seeing slow-mo cinematics of your enemies-' heads exploding into pieces, this is a great game for you.-Fallout V.A.T.S. on steroids-
ye, it'sa gud geme
Well yeah.... This is a great game
Seems overwhelming/boring at first. Once you play for more than 2 hourse + leave good springs, you're gonna be hooked
undertale? more like underBUTT XDDDDD
I have to play this whenever I feel hyper/ want to relieve stress. It's way too good for such a small game
I'm into oldschool point and click games with (Use, talk, look) commands so this is a neat little story-game.The first episode took me about 10 minutes to beat, but hey I'd like to play the rest of the episodes when they come out
