This is not a Metal Gear Solid game.This is just another generic brown dude-shooter.Of what I-'ve played so far it is easily the worst MGS game story wise. I havent played many other MGS games admittedly (only Snake Eater and Peace Walker, and Gound Zeros I suppose. All the others I watched on Youtube). This is just such a disappointment, it-'s not neccasarily a bad game, but it was no where near my very high expections. The real problem is, I can-'t quite put my finger on what exactly I don-'t like about this game (apart from the -story-). There are few things though, like Big Bosses voice actor (can-'t remember his name), he barely says anything, I just find myself begging him to actually talk, and when he does I wish he would stop, the character just seems like another generic action-game protaganist. Its just disappointing.I-'ll still be playing this game simply because I feel obliged, but I won-'t be enjoying it nearly as much as I had hoped. The strange thing is, I really quite loved GZ, so again, I am really disappointed.
I have over 80 hours played at the time of writing this and just started another playthrough. I have got every single achievement and completed the game in 2 of 4 -bonus playthroughs- (or something) where the game adds new and difficult gimics (no achievements for those). This is without a doubt one of the best games I-'ve ever played, I would easily recommend it to anyone that can deal with a little blood and gore.Buy it.
A funny, challenging little Indie game suitable for all ages.
