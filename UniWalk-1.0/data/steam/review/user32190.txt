2015/10/16It used to be a great game,no i bought most of the dlc just to support this game,now its really bad at this update,i dont mind the skins but it affect the gun's stats!? seriously!?I recommended u not to buy it right now. Wait for sales.Edit:2015/10/21 [From Asia]They put drill into card drop now,which is really awesome! My friend just said there are 3 types of skins incase u still dont know,There are normal skins,stats boost,and a skin that already have attachment in it. U can remove the attachment but idk how cause i dont have it.But this game is not p2w now! I still recommend u to buy it anytime u want.But the dlc...wait for sales except for gage mod courier.P.S:THEY ADDED FIRST WORLD BANK BACK! :D
