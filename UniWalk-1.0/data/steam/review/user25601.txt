Excellent title, has many simularities to The Last of Us, but it has no zombies. The games scavenging and stealth mechanics are polished, and smooth. Also, it is a very emotionally draining game, you feel quite depressed after playing. 10/10 would reccomend again
Great game with an awesome gore system :3
