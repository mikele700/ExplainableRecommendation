this game...is a DayZ wannabe game..with less graphic but with less glitches :p...this game has potential to be good at its fully release, Wait? Eearly access?..its too good as an Early Access game.. so i expect to find so much at its final release..Gameplay:Surviving concept?...this game nailed it, don't be fooled by its graphic, the game play is fun, challenging, and full of intensity...but still this game needs a public server..as far as i've seen..i can only play private by join some server by ip'sbut over all is great i'll give it...7/10 as a public universall review...but in my personal rate...it will be 8/10good job with this game and keep it goin'...
Best...Gaem...Ever....Nuff said
