I have only sampled this game but, it seems to be more challenging, better looking and overall a good edition to the serious.I'm not happy with performance yet. There is no SLI Support and running at 4k my 980's dont seem to be optimized for this game. Hopefully new drivers and optimaztion will start flowing very soon.
