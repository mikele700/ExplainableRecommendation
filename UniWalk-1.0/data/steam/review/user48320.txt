Rust is a social experiment. Anything you craft in-game can, and probably will be raided and stolen, no matter the defenses. People will add you to their friends list for the sole purpose of knowing if you're offline or not in-game, so as to determine the perfect time to steal all your items. Rust is a soul-crushing digital manifestation of what happens when the world breaks down and guns and explosives are the only form of barter or negotiation.It is a beautiful game. The sunrises and sunsets are majestic.What it does to people. however, is the exact opposite. Rust is a more brutal, unforgiving, and relentless online arena than EvE Online - as even in EvE. you could park your assets in a neutral station and wait for the storm to pass. Here, the storm is everywhere... right outside your door, crawling on your ceiling, while you're asleep in your bed. Waking up to find your assets intact in Rust can be considered a major accompishment, and usually only practical for those in large clans which cross multiple time zones.Copy Pasta
