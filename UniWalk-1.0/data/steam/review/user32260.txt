Besides the fact you are stuck for the first 10 unranked games as you get a 20 hour penalty every two wins. It was extremely hard to get to ranked because of that very reason. So other than that the game has a very interesting community and a very serious one too. Definitly should buy the game as you will enjoy it once you begin to know how to play it.
Best Real life simulator ever. I felt like I was in a different universe.
