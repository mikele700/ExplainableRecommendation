An awesome game from an awesome series. While this is a hack-n-slash spin off of the from the rad as ♥♥♥♥ Metal Gear universe it is still a great game. It takes the dodge mechanic from bayonetta that everyone loved and gives it a cyborg twist. With a mind blowing sound track, stunning visuals and epic boss fights this is a must buy for any character action gamer. Oddly easy too, did most of normal mode with -A- ranks first try while mucking about :P9.5/10!P.s Grab a controller cause it can get button mashy
