This is a title you and all your friends should have in your steam library!!!Even though Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 Triple Thrill Pack was released way back in 2002, you will have an amazing experience playing this witnessing one of PC-'s greatest releases. All the people who played RCT1 or RCT2 back in the day will be reliving their childhoods by building massive Rollercoasters and themeparks.This is a -MUST GET- title for RCT fans or interested gamers.
I SWEAR UBISOFT CAME FROM THE FUTURE!!!Now you can plug in your guitar through your PC and play guitar through your PC.Rocksmith 2014 is the best and most easy way to learn Guitar or Bass!!! Would Strongly Recommend this to anyone who wants to pick up and learn the Guitar. Also if you are already a guitar player, There are a bunch of activitys in the game for advanced guitar players so its not just limited for beginners.IM TELLING YOU, THIS GAME IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!
