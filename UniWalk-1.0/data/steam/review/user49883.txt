Magicka 2 won't even launch. After clicking play there is a black screen and the game quits almost immediately. Can't rate if I can't play.
Haven't played much, but I already love this game. I was having lots of fun swimming around, collecting my resources. I got attacked by these piranha things and almost ♥♥♥♥ myself. Scared to go in the water again. I rate 8/8.
Boats pls?
