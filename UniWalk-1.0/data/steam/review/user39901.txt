A lot of people are saying guns are underpowered, i have been instantly killing triceratopses with 1 bow shot to the heart, they aren't underpowered, you just ened to take in the fact that you need a good shot.PROS-Simulation of where the organs in dinosaurs are seems real-Guns seem very nice-The Camps are really good and useful with finding guns and equipment-Game is really enjoyable, if you dislike it just play with friends and hunt t-rexs, will make the game more funCONS-Sometimes if you are lying down and a t-rex comes to you it stands there until you kill it or disconnect and re connect-Game is a bit buggy (it's in EA to be expected)-Not enough diversity with dinos and guns (it's in EA to be expected)
One of the biggest let downs ever, all they had to do to fix this game was change the Ai so that the whole squad doesn't focus one enemy and attack one at a time, game just needs to be more realistic...
