Being a long time Batman fan, and picking up this game cheap on Steam after playing it 3 times on Xbox, it was still a good choice. Great combat, interesting riddles and challenges, and rather nostalgic for people who have played the whole series up to Arkham Origins, or if you just enjoy the Batman universe. Well worth the buy, along with the rest of the Arkham series.
