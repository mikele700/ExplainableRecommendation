This is how a DLC should be done, It isn't a new weapon or map or costume as other game developers have done *cough* Overkill *cough*. This is more then that, a new map bigger than the main maps and includes a drivable buggy which is fully customisable as well as an in depth story that could last you hours. The main plot of the dlc is that a guy with one eye arrives at the tower bloody and disoriented and tells you about a cult that is immune to the virus before passing out. you are sent outside the city into the countryside to investigate this claim. This plot has your usual stuff like weird cult, possible supernatural connections and conspiracies that run deeper than a prisoners ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You will find some useful pass times including long walks on the beach, nice sunday drives and your usual zombie killing, parkour madness that is Dying Light The Following.
it is an awesome game
