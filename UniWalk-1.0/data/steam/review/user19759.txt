The game and gameplay itself is okay, the story kinda -meh- for me. Sadly the are not so much character creation and class variation in the game. It has pets tho. The attack keybind is awfull you will constantly moving while trying to attack thankfuly you can press shift when attacking to not move.
Better than the so called -updated version-. Seriously the dev should-'ve make it an update.
bought it for r18 mod. OH WAIT, PAID MOD.
