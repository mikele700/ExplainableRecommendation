This is a good game, no doubt about it. But it is on a whole another level of hard.How hard? Think 2D Dark Souls with a pixelly look and a time limit on each level.Oh, and the final boss is an inescapable advancing wall of doom with 4k hp.
FTL: faster than light is a brilliantly designed, albeit rather unforgiving, space-themed, roguelike strategy game. It may take some getting used to, but if you do have the patience and are willing to repeat events, then it is a must. 8/10
