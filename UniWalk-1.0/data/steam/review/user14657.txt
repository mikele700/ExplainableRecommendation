This game has got to be one of my favourite games over the past year, I find this game really enjoyable since it has everything I look for in a singleplayer game: Variety of clothes, items and character customizaitons (Not to mention weapons damn son) I really enjoy the characters and there stories, The missions in this game are really fund combined with the side storys and multiple endings make this game 10x more enjoyable. The fantastic looky lookies of the game (Get ****ED if you don't like how it looks M9).What I really don't like about this : Bugs (On many occassions I have came across from time to time a guy that will hit me and kill me in one hit for no reason) If you alt tab you will crash no matter what and of course the occassional bug where you will randomally grab someone without pressing the grab button.Just because of these bugs do not ruin this game for me and infact hardly noticable on occassions. The game is still overall a really fun and enjoyable game to play.
Really enjoyable game-Character customization is pretty good-Clothing variety is amazing-Lots of different play stylesThe only thing i wish i could do is change my characters server with out loss of items
Fun as a little game to play here and there
beautiful, there is not much to say about this game yet since alot of the features of this game have not been added yet due to its early access state but so far you can see it is heading in the right direction.
This game sucks, The only fun I can get out of it is the PVP BATTLEFIELD servers. If I play on a survival server some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ comes along uses 5 c4 to blow the doors open shoot me and say noob. Call me whatever you want this is what I think and This is why survival games are ruined
With this new update they have recently release, I have decided to update my review on Survival: Postapocalypse Now.Now as I start out my review, this is my personal opinion on the game I know the game isn't great and yes it is in Early Access.Pros:-Has some interesting features I have not seen in other survival games.-Has some decent combat (not the best)-There are no generic zombies.-The starting zone in the jail is a really good idea I think, it is pretty creative and I have not seen this in any other of the survival games I have played.-Look at the cute ban screen :)Cons:-The Graphics are not the best, But they are alright and bearable.-The Game is unoptimized and you are garunteed fps drops while playing this game.- The wolves/dogs are not the best and have some issues about them, like walking through walls continue walking after death.-I have had alot of issues with the temperature in this game and find myself dying of cold no matter what.-Some items are not in english, this is an okay thing since the game is made by russains so if they haven't fully translated stuff thats cool there is probably also mods to fix thisOverall: 7.5/10Note: There is other survival games worth off gettings, but this game does not require much to run and does have the potential to become alot better.
This game is really entertaining, the realistic gun mechanics and simplistic level design makes this game really fun and entertaining too play.If you are like me and got the game for free from another game then it is great and entertaining, although I am not saying this game isn't worth buying it totally is.
