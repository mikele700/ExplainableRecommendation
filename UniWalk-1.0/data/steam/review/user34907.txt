good game i love but the main problem is that the zombies are so persistan that if you don't have a weapon once your spotted you either have to risk your life and punch them to death or run into the ocean and the crawlers are so damn overpowered they are really fast for only crawling on arms and their hitbox is tiny and they attack crazy fast and are faster than you and the only way to hit them wthout a weapon is to crouch and punch them which most of the time results in your death but once again great game
This game sounded really good so i downloaded it, it didn't take that long so i thought cool but when i got to the gameplay it is slow boring and they don't teach you anything you have to figure it out on your own and the gameplpay is SO SLOW you can be walking/jogging because the running doesn't really count as running but back to the point you can be going around for hours and not find ANY animals and you have to pay to be able to hunt more than 2 different species of animals it is such a waste of time REALLY dissapointing ik i haven't put much time into the game but so far it is bad.
i got this game i liked it it had some bugs and the worst things about it was the fact that EVERY MISSION is either talking to people or clearing out dungeons that jst seemed reskinned  and then the absolute WORST THING ABOUT THIS GAME is the fact that i put it down for a little bit (about 2-3 days) go back all my characters are ♥♥♥♥ing gone! that has made me uninstall this ♥♥♥♥
This game is good i like the fact that it isn't pay to win and you get dragons and weapons that all look cool but one thing i did HATE is after they said it was completely F2P they told me i can unlock everything for $20 which kinda seems like pay to win as obviously some draogns and weapons are gonna be OP and you can get them instantly for only $20 which gives this game a pay to win kinda thing but the game is still REALLY good
I love this game it is awesome but teh fact that you need a microsft live account to save the game is bull and it is saying that teh code has been used for another account that doesn't exist as i am the only one that knows the code and have 1 account
this game is so good i haven't tried out all the classes yet ihave only used warrior and vampire but the graphics are good ithe gameplay is good and the damn abilities are awesome
