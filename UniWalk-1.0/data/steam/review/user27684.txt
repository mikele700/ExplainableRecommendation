With all this Micro-Transition crap going on, people are over reacting. Have you tried using an AK? A Car-4? Both of vanilla guns and still good. And if you have got the Big Bank DLC, you can use the Eagle Rifle, which is really good! IMHO, the introduction of the safes and drills is just a poke at CSGO. I wouldn-'t be surprised if CSGO realeses something to do with Payday 2 soon, so like to say -I see what your doing there!-. Honestly, the skins only give a bonus if you get the StatBoost variant. Everyone needs to stop acting like babies crying over something that you can now grind for. Drills and Safes through Cards.Also, you have to realise that the only game that Overkill is making money off right now is Payday 2. Unless you want them to go bankrupt because you dont like your Overpowered guns not killing greens in oneshot in overkill, means your kinda of selfish. Wait a bit, by the start of next year, this whole thing would of blown over and people would stop caring.
THis is a really fun game. I know I havent put much hours into it, but thats because whenever I try to finish part 5, act 3 all of the waves start at once without me hitting space. This is really irritating and I hope it gets fixed soon, but other than that its really good for people who like dungeon crawlers
