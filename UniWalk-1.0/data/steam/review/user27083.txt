Woke me up inside.10/10
One of the best of the Call of Duty series to date. Has a great story that is worth replaying just for the awesome atmosphere and set pieces. Multiplayer community is smaller than what it once was, but is still quite easy to get a game going. Highly recommend to play with friends!
