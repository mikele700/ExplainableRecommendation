The second best driver since the original one. Seriously you have to give it a go!
Well, It's certainly a massive disappointment for PC gamers at least, However, it's not a terrible game. The gameplay is solid, the driving is arcade-y and not incredibly realistic. It will take some time to get used to. The cover system is actually very nice and responsive. The shooting is decent so no real argument about the gameplay itself. But Ubisoft downgraded this game and it has very much affected my trust in the company (Not that I had all that much to begin with). The optimisation is abysmal and even on a beast of a PC it runs below 60 FPS. In short, sure it’s a good game, but it’s not a great game. Also I hate Uplay as much as the next man but it’s not all that bad. 6/10
