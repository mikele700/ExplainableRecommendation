The game is OK i guess, but i think ill need to play it for a little bit more since the game takes so long to complete.
its frieken amazing!
Beautiful game, 10/10 for originality too, brought me to tears in some parts. wont suit everyone but is a must have for anyone with an open mind
A reasonably alright game, couldve used alot more polish however, and i dont like how -linear- it is. I would-'ve prefered it if you had a mode where you actually have targets that arent a part of the story, and you get money for it and stuff (i know contracts mode has stuff like that but a constant internet connection is required) The AI are kinda stupid too... And when someone finds a body, there could be 100 people there and the AI targets.... YOU! .... just in a crowd staring at a crime scene as people do... and the Cop targets some random aged guy in a suit!! i mean... COME ON!!!
It is AMAZING! the concept of it and the graphics along with the fast paced action co-op and powers is awesome :D
