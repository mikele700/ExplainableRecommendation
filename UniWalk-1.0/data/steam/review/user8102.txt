Its all about the hats - in the best possible wayWhere else could you spend 1000's of dollars on hats that add not one cent of difference to your damage ability / health or any other stat.  Its free (as much as you want it to be) and fantastic fun in so many many ways.   A few hours to be proficient ( you will die a lot )  - hundreds of hours to master ( you still die alot - just not so quickly ). 4,500 hrs - what more needs to be said.
