It was about half a year ago that I first played this game, and at the time it didn't really grab my attention all that much. I would have to say that the first part of the first episode (the only one I had played at that point), is not exactly representative of the game as a whole; it gets a whole lot better. Recently I acquired a PC that could actually play this game (my first foray into the game being on an xbox 360). and I picked up the game for 75% off during a Steam Sale. And I have to say, it is one of the better games I have ever bought.Playing through this game is an incredible experience. It continues to be as such on consecutive playthroughs, but nothing can compare to that first time. The choices you have to make have an incredible impact, and can drastically change how large portions of the game play out.In the end, if you're a fan of the Walking Dead TV show, but even more so if you are a fan of the comic books, then you should definitely pick this up. It is an experience that will change you forever, and I could not more highly recommend it.
Basically, if you enjoyed Far Cry 3, then you should like this game. If you like the Terminator, Aliens, Robocop... or anything else '80s', then you will love this game. Oh, and by the way, Sergeant Rex Power Colt is pretty much the coolest video game protagonist of all time, so there's that as well.
