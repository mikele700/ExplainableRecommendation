Terraria is a game that has kept me entertained for hours, With all the bosses and item to collect. There is so much more to do than just sit around and chop trees all day. If your into the sandbox and adventure style of games I think you would enjoy this I would recommend it to you if you like sandbox, Building, fighting pvp or just working with friends.
