This game is just so much fun. Once you start there's no going back. Enjoy!
Amazing game from start to finish. Had me captured from the word go, making me want more and constantly delivering. I always was one for walking simulators so maybe it's a bit biased, but I enjoyed the scenery and the relaxing parts, as well as the tension, the fear of what's next. The hype over this is well founded and I can easily see why it's regarded so highly.tl;dr- Story: 10/10- Graphics: 10/10- Value for money: 7/10 - it is $20 but it's not much if you have a job you lazy slobsOverall good game, no complaints from me.
