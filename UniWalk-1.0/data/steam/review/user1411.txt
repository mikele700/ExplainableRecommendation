I started my own company where we help fat people move around the city by lifting them up with forklifts and taking them to their destinations (see my screenshot).
Despite the 1.37 update which earned my negative review, the developers have changed my mind and earn back my positive review with the improved flight models, damage system, more aircrafts and the tanks are added into War Thunder finally. They are already developing naval battles at the moment. You can tell the developers are putting such a huge amount of effort into this game to give you the best gamer experience as possible and to put you in the seat of that aircraft,tank or ship and immerse you into the WWII experience.
