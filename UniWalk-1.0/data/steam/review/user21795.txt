Truely my favourite game, is pay to win and by that I mean that if you buy stuff for the game you have an advantage over the free to plays. In my own opinion this is better than GTA as this has much more play time and effort and customization. If I'm bored, I play APB. If I'm tired, frustrated or just feel like having fun I play APB.I LOVE APB.
