Brilliant, great graphics and unbelievable realism. i would definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone!
Tis good, play it you filthy peasants
this game is amazeballs, nough said
i cant even stand still on the lowest graphical settings it's so bad...
it is actually quite fun to shoot the wings off enemy planes and laugh to yourself as you watch them fall to their deaths...
