I absolutely love the adrenalin rush i get from tapping trees with a big-♥♥♥ rock for half an hour and then building a house made from the splinters I collected from the tapping of the trees.No, it's a really, REALLY good game considering it's only 10% completed. Definately worth the $20.Great job guys, i look forward to tapping some more trees soon! :D
Great game.... admit it... you just want it to pose the ragdoll in sexual positions.... ;P
It has a ♥♥♥♥-load of -ambiguous packages-... and crashes every time on the Unreal engine intro sequence. Why does it do this? Does anyone else get this?
every single time i go to play -unknown error-...... normally i-'d recommend.
Not bad, definately NOT the worst game i've played but i wouldn't recommend it all the same.WAY too close to HL2 and it's a bit weird to play at first but you get over it once the story lures you in.Poorly placed ammo and no melee weapon to compensate. I mean, come on guys, you can do better than that.
FREAKING AWESOME GAME! a must get, no matter what!If your friends tell you not to get it, get rid of them. you don't need that kind of negativity in your life.
