Rocket League is a video game. It contains cars, rockets, and football (soccer for you Americans). These elements come to together to create a chaotic and yet surprisingly both mechanically and strategically deep game that is full of tense moments. Super stable performance, tight controls, and vibrant, clear visuals come together to create a great gaming experience from start to finish. The game does have some failings however. Chief among these is the fact that even in the so-called ranked queue it is possible to leave matches with no penalty other than the expected decrement on rating from losing. This leads to numerous situations in which one person will leave after a single goal and cause their team to lose an otherwise close game. Additionally, it is possible for games to begin with an uneven number of people, even in ranked queue. Further, it seems that matchmaking an inexplicably break at times, forcing you to restart your search for a match. Minor gripes at best, but worth considering. Should you buy this game? Do you like fun? How about puppies? Well this game has at least 50 percent of the things you're looking for! I give this game an arbitrary 8 flying cars out of 10.
