Good game.
One of the most fun games I have ever played and even more fun when playing with friends. Unturned is a very fun zombie survival game that is absolutely free to play for everyone and I see a lot of good things to come for the future updates for this game. 10/10 for me.
A very good game if you like police shotouts and stealing from the banks. If you wanna be a criminal, wear a clown mask and pointing guns at the cops and civilians, this is the game to play.
A very good game to play!
This game is truly a gamespy classic. A game that will be remembered as one of the best games that Lucas Arts ever made. This game will be cherished forever.
A fun game if you are a fan of the anime series. There is a lot going on this game and there is so much to do in it such as side events and doing challenging missions to earn more items.10/10 for me but the multiplayer still needs a bit more fixing to do but overall great game.
