A universal story of two brothers struggling through a dangerous fantasy world with an ending that will likely be one of the most emotional you have experienced in a game. The puzzles are great and work very well with the main mechanic (one player controls two characters)- I believe it is best played with a controller although if you're comfortable with keyboard it's also worth trying.
