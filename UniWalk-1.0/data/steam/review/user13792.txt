Truth be told the only reason I have this installed is for Garry's Mod but still a good game!
2Hard2Handle
I climed through the roof and fell into an endless void and skipped half the game 10/10
This is an amazing game I loved every moment of it from the unique combat to the great story this game is brilliant!
after hearing the reviews i thought, im gonna buy this and its gonna suck D: but its pretty f**king awesome!
10/10 would ninja stealth skills
