Looked away for a second to answer a text, wracked up about $2000 in car damage fines. This game has taught me the importance of not texting and driving.11/10 IGN
If you play First Person Shooters on PC, this is a must!
This is quite possibly the very only game experience that I will tell about to my grandchildren like if it was a war memory :'(
Just finished the game, and I don’t feel like I just beat a video game. I feel like I just returned home after running and hiding from a motherf*****g alien on a ship deep in space.This is not a video game, it’s an experience.PS: This game makes my nipples so hard they could cut through glass :[
