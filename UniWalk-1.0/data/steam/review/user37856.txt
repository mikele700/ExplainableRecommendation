This game reminds me why LEGO Indy won me over all those years ago. A very bright, sometimes funny look at the MARVEL universe.
Early impressions are good, loving the big monster fights and graphics. Castlevania is providing a decent challenge on the hardest starting difficulty, will definately play more!
