Well worth getting this Game, hours of fun with friends or on your own.
This game is amazing, with an interesting Story, amazing Music and Voice acting too.I-'m not gonna lie, this game is Heartbreaking, so if you feel up to that, go right ahead and buy this amazing game.-Please do not divide Heaven in two..-
Amazing game, it has a Huge map and many quests, i doubt i will ever finish it 100% xDthe mods for the game aren't bad either!
I Absolutely Love this game, the Characters are well written and the voice work was done amazingly. this was well worth the money i paid for it. as you can see by my playtime, i have spent a long time going through all the possible Routes and i can happily say i don't think my time was wasted :)
Catgirls, Cakes and Voiced very well (with the exception of the MC)this was worth the $10 i payed for it.
