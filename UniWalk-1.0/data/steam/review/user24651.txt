This game is the most awesome Call of Duty ive ever known and I really recommend getting this game, the price sadly only includes one Zombies map which kinda sucks but apart from that this game is a boss. Multiplayer has become alot more fast paced and Singleplayer now supports coop which is soo awesome. This game is a must buy!!!
Awesome game, lots of content, especcially if you get addons!!!!
Is goood
I just hate the game, its been in Alpha forever, I want my money Back!!!!!!
This game has good first person unlike other games I really recommend this game XD
