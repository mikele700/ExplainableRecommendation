Theres an old saying by xXX_D4NKM4ST3R_Xxx any game with no trickshots sucks. And hes right, Whers the trickshoters and noscopers. Incredibly dissapointing. If your looking for a game where you can yell at kids -you ♥♥♥♥ed their mum so hard they ♥♥♥,- This is not the right choice.
I want to die and i have crippling severe depression. 10/10 would half life again
Diverse,Creative world. Top it off with amazing gameplay and high amount of quest. Bethesda games cease to amaze its fan with products that continue to please them for many years. Skyrim, unlike any other RPG's dedicate themselves into the finest detail from the gameplay to graphics to the point of perfection. 0/10 You can't modify the sky in skyrim
10/10. Not enough garrys
Hey everyone, its that game where you get ♥♥♥♥ on every 5 seconds by pre-buscent teenagers who claim who have lives..nope yh diffrent game :D
If I have a dollar for everytime I get a carambit knife. I still have a dollar cause Gabe Newell hates me.
Weird, Quirky and downright fun. A great free to play fps if you don't mind humongous saggy breast and random dances after a hectic match.
I ended up having financial difficulties resulting me to live on the streets due to the overpurchase of hats. 10/10 a great game
