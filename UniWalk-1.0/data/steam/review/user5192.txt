A few years later and I still want my money back...In all honesty, its alright I guess, though the story is a bit jumpy at times and not as satisfying as the others with mediocre multiplayer games. If you really like COD then you should avoid it and spend your time playing other ones instead, well whatever.

A satisfying immersive experience that does not last for very long as its actually content and mechanics are at times lacking. It has simplified many of the RPG elements that were present in the previous game that make the game seem less RPGish in comparison to the rest of the franchise. Decent story, poor characters, good world and dungeon design (although ♥♥♥♥ at some points), often at times over rated by casuals, decent gameplay mechanics and bad stealth as you get more trouble with putting baskets on people's heads...
