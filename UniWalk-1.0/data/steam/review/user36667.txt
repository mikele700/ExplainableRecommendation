Minecraft: Story Mode doesn’t feel like a Telltales game. It feels like a cash-in. It feels like Microsoft threw a big beefy contract at Telltales and said “Just do the usual”.At first glance it may look like the usual fare: an impressive ensemble cast and a heavy lean on comedy but in actuality they've taken some big names, thrown them into a mixing bowl and hoped for the best.Some of the Actors are dreadful and either don’t understand voice acting or have had terrible direction. The plot - or as much as I absorbed - isn’t very interesting.In a lot of ways it’s similar to existing Telltales games but instead of an engrossing story with memorable characters it’s a waste of effort on the developer's part and a waste of time on the player’s.
Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry-'s Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry-'s Mod. It-'ll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.-Where do I start?- This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It-'s also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm..._The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there-'s singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I-'m talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide -'n seek, and much, much, more._Graphics? I-'ll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don-'t complain much about the graphics, but I-'m not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It-'s not 2006 anymore._Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds._Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want._My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I-'m not gonna stop playing it for a while and I-'m already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Story: N/ASound: 8/10Replayability: 10/10Overall 8.5Even though, this is one positive review on Garry-'s Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry-'s Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...
