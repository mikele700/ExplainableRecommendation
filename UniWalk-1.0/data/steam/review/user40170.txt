I've being playing this game since the beginning, I may not have overclocked hours into like others, but I've been here apart of the community for a while. I have seen the updates and the progress, adding new content, improving gameplay and twecking features. Overall I've been happy, but this game is dying. The one thing that has cut the last straw is that fact that i have to wait 15-20 minutes to join a game that doesnt last no longer than 60 seconds, and I'm not over reacting, after wasting my time, on average a game lasts no longer than 60 seconds. Cause of this constant long time consumption, i have now uninstalled this game as the developers are too worried about releasing new content instead of fixing numerous problems. Maybe we'll see, in the future if they decide to fix it, ill re-install it again and play again with mates. But it's not just me, its a large majority who have the same problem.
