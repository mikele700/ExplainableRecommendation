While yes i enjoyed playing this game i found that the lack of a simple save button was annoying, and sometimes my save file was deleted for some reason, i didn't really know why, which is less then helpful. It was fun at some points and very zelda esque which is a really nice touch with the pieces of heart and the treasure after a boss, though i still found that my save file being deleted was way too big of a set-back so i can't really recommend it, though if you happen to pick it up you will atleast enjoy it.
