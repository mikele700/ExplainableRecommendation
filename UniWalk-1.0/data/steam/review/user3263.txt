First couple minutes of the game I had absolutely no idea what was going on. It didn't take me too long to get used to all the games mechanics. Before long I was rolling around in piles of my Ingots. With each research complete I was getting more and more excited to see what the end-game would be. Now that I have gotten to that point I have a huge challenge ahead of me and I can’t wait to see what I can do with it. I've had the game for 4 days with roughly 90 hours of gameplay. Most addicted I’ve gotten to a game in a long time. Buy it!
as a big fan of the Senran Kagura series I was glad to see it had been ported to the 'Master Race'As for gameplay and such it's exactly the same as the original console version but better because I don't have to turn on my PlayStation to start playing. 10/10.
Most people I know say its just like Minecraft but 2D and not as good That is completely wrong this game has soo many things to do I have hundreds of hours and i dont think I've done half of the things in this game Buy It!!!

THIS IS SO MUCH FUN!!!! ... unless you dont have friends
At least 50% of the people trying to play the game simply can't.      mine works fine, 60 FPS, GTX 970As for the game review: Space is fun and lazers ... lazers are fun too.
