Race the sun is an action packed arcade feeling game that you can pick up and just play. The fast paced action allows for players to feel the speed and intensity of racing to the horizon of the map dodging obstacles that lie ahead. the gameplay is very smooth and controller support adds that extra controll to the game. the overall map layout could be a bit more colourful but other than that this game wants you to try and get that high score. overall i would rate this a 9.5/10 because it is a great game and i really recomend it to players of all ages and skills
get this game it is fun to play and adicting. it can be a rage game when getting into the harder levels but thats all part of the challenge :)
