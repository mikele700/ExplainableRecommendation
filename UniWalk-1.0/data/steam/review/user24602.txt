One of the best open world RPG's I've ever played and I'm still yet to finish it with 60 hours already in the game. This game is an absolute masterpiece.
This game, is not a masterpiece, it is not perfect, but it is amazing. I am 36 hours in to the game and I am far from finishing in any way shape or form. The game has issues that some mods can fix, such as the controversial dialogue wheel, or the fact that the ground is so low res it looks like Fallout 3 at times. The game also almost forces you into being the Hero, and there is almost no option to be the villian, for example in Fallout 3, within the first twenty minutes of the game you can nuke an entire city. The dialogue can trick you into thinking that you are being -evil- but really your just saying something like a ♥♥♥♥ instead of like a nice guy. But if you can look past these flaws, the game tells an excellent narative, it gives you a constant itch to continue playing or pick it up again, because of the amount of content the game holds. Most of the time I will be walking off to a mission somewhere and I will find a really cool place then that place develops into a hundred other missions and so on. This game is the Fallout we-'ve been wanting since Fallout 3.
