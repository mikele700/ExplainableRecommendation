Overall Content = very good. So glad they kept the blacksmith because that was my favourite part of Lego LOTR.I don't like how full-screen isn't allowed but that is a minor detail. Great game!
*Spoiler Alert*It was good gameplay, but I felt that the level design didn-'t really allow me any breaks. It was actually 3 big levels, with heaps of miniature missions in between.However, THE ENDING WAS HOPELESS! And I say again, *Spoiler Alert* if you are going to kill off one of the main characters, you can-'t mix it with the other -Ready for another mission- ending. You need to keep them separate, and this game didn-'t do that.But I guess that once you get over the ending you will look back at how fun the gameplay was.
The best Lego Game yet!The suit changer added in is something I've waited for since Lego Batman 1, and it is as good as i imagined.They have also gone back to the old method of putting the red bricks in the hubs. This brings back nostalgic memories and it is good to get back to your rootsAs for the gameplay, it retains that high quality, especially in combat.1 slight glitch involved the minikit detector not finding the minikit but minor detail.The hubs are good, shame they are not full-open-world but close enough. The teleportation system works wellThe characters are well balanced, as are the abilities (except Cyborg, he is so OP in late-game) and the DLCs are fantastic!Must buy!
This game has no point whatsoever, and that is what makes it fun. It is the perfect game to just muck around with friends on. It's currently only in beta, and if they make online multiplayer for it then that would be amazing. Still, you can play locally. I hooked up 3 controllers to a PC and played Starwhal and had a great time. Cool game.
