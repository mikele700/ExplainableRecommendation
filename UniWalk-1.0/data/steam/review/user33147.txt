Bought the game to see what the hype is about (despite it being five years old.)If you've played any game in the last three years (Minecraft and Goat Simulator included) I guarantee you they have better mechanics than this.Although this game may have been cutting edge five years ago, any game on the market today will top it gameplay wise.Also, they grappling hook isn't great.Yeah, I went there.
