Very realistic and challenging, in addition to its map's puzzles and objectives make this zombie game a true experience.In my opinion, this game is designed to be for hardcore video gamers. So griefers and slow-witted people, stop reading now.So far the game has amazing combat scenarios where you can't just do something very stupid to get out of the situation, say crowd surfing a bunch of zombies or slipping past them because there was just one tiny opening in their swarm. This makes it difficult because it slows down our instincts because we've gotten used to fast paced shooters like Team Fortress 2, Call of Duty, Left 4 Dead and the Counter-Strike series, in which it gives us a truly unique experience where we have to stick together, conserve our supplies sparringly and work as a team in order to fully enjoy this game.
