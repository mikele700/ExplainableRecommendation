XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a HIGHLY recommended game for strategy players especially from the RTS genre. XCOM EU is based from the classic XCOM game and was remade especially for the modern players. Gameplay wise, this is more of a turn based strategy playing and planning for a good executions. This game is also very similar to the old Rainbow Six games such as Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear because of the squad based planning and customization like changing your squad-'s faces, body, helmet, armor, etc.If you love playing mind games like Chess or Games of the General, this game is highly recommended for you. Of course, you-'ll end up enjoying it so much that thinking is never been so hard to do. Your head will NEVER hurt in playing this game. 100% guarantee (unless you-'re frustrated in losing your -best friend-).I really highly recommend it to you all especially for those who are NOT an RTS fan and turn based gaming. Storyline wise, it is a top notch but the ending is quite -predictable-. Nevertheless, overall the game is worth to buy and worth the weight!Verdict: 8.9/10
