A good game to play when internet is down, can sharpen your reflexes. Best to play online with friends.
Amazing game, especially with friends. 10 out of 10. Would play again.
If you thought Super Meat Boy was hard, you thought wrong. Super Meat Boy ain't got nothing on this.
Great free to play game, it's like red-dead redemption but deathmatch, first person and no dead eye. Awesome to play with friends online even better when in lan.
