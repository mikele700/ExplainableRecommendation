this is a very fun and nice 80s themed shooter. im not good at spoiler free reviews so im just gonna keep it short. do you like Shooters? did you like the 80s action movies? and most importantly do you like to play as a badass action hero?. if you do buy this game :D
if you liked Half life i would really recommend getting this expansion.im not gonna spoil anything so im just gonna say buy this if you want more half life.
a must have classic from steam definitely worth buying.
this game is a perfect remake of the original half life. personally one of the best remakes i have played in a long time. there are a few changes in the remake but for the most part its almost the same as the original half life.the game still needs Xen to be completed but all the other chapters are ready for you to play and enjoy. i say buy this game if you loved the original half life. but avoid it if you can t wait for xen to be completed.
