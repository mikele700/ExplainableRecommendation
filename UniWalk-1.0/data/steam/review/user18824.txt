Who doesn't love a good heist?With new DLC (proper DLC too, not just skin packs like some other games) coming in every month or so it keeps the interest up in the game always having something new to do.Originally the game was quite easy, but with significant rehauls of pretty much every mechanic the game has a challenge for any skill level. And that's what the game is about, always having that next harder challenge to pull off. There's nothing quite like pulling off a flawless heist or outlasting an assault against all odds.I love a good team game, and this is one of the best.
