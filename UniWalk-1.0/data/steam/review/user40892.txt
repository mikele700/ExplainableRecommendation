There's quite a few directions you can go while playing/farming and that allows you to learn and play again with a better plan.
Best game that came through 7 years
Such a small game, but HUGE in it-'s story and atmosphere. Best -free to play- game I-'ve ever encountered.
It's a game that is based on feeding fish and killing monster that enter the fish tank.
not bad for a single player game that is hards to complete
A great game to play when bord
