The low tier waiting times are way too long. I've been waiting for 10 mins and haven't got a game.
Awesome game, though chaotic. You start off with a few monsters spawning then the second you get to the next stage, you get 50 monsters trying to feast on you. Death messages are amazing and the items captions are hilarious. 11/10, most chaotic game ever.
Loved it, I reccomend getting the Los Angeles mod by Hoppah. It's a great game without the mod but the mod makes it even better. 10/10, Would explode again
