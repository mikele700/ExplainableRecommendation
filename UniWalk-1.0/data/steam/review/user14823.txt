Just go onto the internet and 'play' a case opening simulator.It will save you a lot of time and money.Lots of money.
There are enough things to steal that after awhile you don't even care about money anymore.8.73/10 Would steal again.
Hotline Miami is a game where you kill people.You kill a lot of people.The amount is absurd actually.Just because a voice on a phone told you to do it.You smart, smart person.Australian Government/10 would ban this and sequel again.
I-It's not like I like this game or anything b-baka!The game for weeaboos.You got swords and you got demons.Like.That's pretty much the plot.Have fun. You absolute ♥♥♥♥ing weeaboo.9/10 Would anime the ♥♥♥♥ out again.
Team Fortress 2, a game where you run around and shoot people and- oh wait no. This is a game about hats as well. Don't get me wrong it's about shooting people, but more about hats.Little kid getting scammed/10 would wear again.
Not enough Pass the Whiskey jokes8/10
After awhile you just tend to spend more time modding the game than actually playing.10/10 would mod again
