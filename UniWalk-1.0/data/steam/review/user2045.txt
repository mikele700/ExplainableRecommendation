A fantastic game that is now double the fun. Don't Starve Together is rewarding as you can slay monsters togther, create tactics for hunting and have 2x (more depending on the players,) the productivity. But in a hilarious and fun way in can be more punishing. Food is more scarce, there are more monsters and when a mate gets killed, his ghost will haunt you and drive you to suicide!If you love Don't Starve and have a friend or two who also enjoys the game, buy this and you will have hours, and hours of fun. If your a tight-♥♥♥ like me, just wait untill it becomes free.
