A good buy for casual play. At first i thought id get annoyed with the graphics but they grew on me and i began to appreciate the artistic merit of it. The game is humorous, can be difficult but rarely frustrating and i absolutely love the high turnover for weapons, im constantly discovering bigger and better guns which always adds intrest for me.a good single player and multiplayer game that i constantly come back to.
