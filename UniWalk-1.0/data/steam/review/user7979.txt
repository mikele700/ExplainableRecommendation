I liked this DLC. To all the people complaining that the bosses show up at random times, don't do the Dr Vahlen mission till you're ready. The other bosses CAN'T show up till that mission is finished.You know the bosses retreat when their health gets low. So you don't need to worry about removing their full health bar in one go. Get Rangers with bladestorm to slash them. Damage, and when the boss takes its action, damage again.Always have you're guys on overwatch, then they get initial shots when the boss shows up. I beat the bezerker my getting my 5 of my soldier up on a roof and standing one above each ladder. The fact that he is always angry made the situation all the more amusing. I only took actions with my Sniper, who was nowhere near the voilence, and he was able to chip away at him, unable to use an AOE ability ever action. Eventually he warped away, and I got on with the mission.I'm currently up to the Archon. He is holding my favourite Ranger up in the air, because he (the Archon) is stunned. I still have 2 frost bombs, because I cleverly equipted them on a Grenadier, who gets double of the grenade in his 'grenade only' slot. Finally, all the frustration of killing a boss is worth it when you kill them, skin them, and wear them as armor.
Unfortunately its really laggy on my computer. Asus S550C, intel core i7 3537u 2.0Ghz. But from what I've been able to make out, and what I've seen others do, it seems really good
