Ok hi THIS IS AIMED AT THE DEVS... This game is cancer it is an absolute peice of crap all you idiots care about is making money and then ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off i love that it's taken 2 fkn years to put ONE SINGLE VEHICLE into the game! Zombies still walk through walls, YOUR CHARACTER RESETS EVERYTIME I LOG BACK IN AND IT'S FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HATE THIS GAME! anyone who reads this should immediatly uninstall DayZ and get a refund if thats not possible go back to the MOD IT'S STILL BETTER THEN THIS PILE OF CRAPTherfore i would like to add Screw you Devs and your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ work :)
Fantastic CO-OP it reminds me of the Walking dead series (game)
i love simulators but this just blows me away
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ♥♥♥♥ING GAME IV'E PLAYED IN A FEW YEARS! DONT THINK BUY IT!
