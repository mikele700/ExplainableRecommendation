It's not the perfect total war game, but it's still a lot of fun. The longer this game excists the better it gets, with the additions of patches and mods the community continue to make this game better every day.
2 game breaking bugs in the first 40 minutes of playing. Hard crashes, freezes and checkpoint bugs. Very dissapointing after hearing so many good things about the port.
A great experience so far. It's funny, precise, imaginitive and extremely well realized.
