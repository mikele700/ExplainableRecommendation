This game is hardcore. Nothing is handed to you and everything can be taken. Very well rounded system and the combat system will really surprise you. Tech trees have specal abilitys and once you rebind your keys and move the action bars around a bit it really feels like your playing an mmo.10/10   50h played in 4 days.If you enjoy the fruits of labour and enjoy carving out your own patch of land then this game is for you.
