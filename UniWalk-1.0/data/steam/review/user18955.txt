A very fun and addictive game. I recommend you to buy it.That is, if you're into sandbox games that has no objectives other than to screw around.
When you first start up the game, it's going to be amazing.From level 1-10 the farming and grinding is fun & easy and the sense of achievement is definitely there.But after level 10, it's where the farming starts to get real.so yeah it's fun for the first 10-15 hours or so but after that you need to put your time into it like other mmorpgs.
