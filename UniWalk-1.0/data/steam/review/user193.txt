this game is cool and stuff but the ranks are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tmy game just crashed and i got de-ranked wtf is this?
well valve u screwed up pyros are too overpowered and now the new update u destroyed the rocke tjumper and there is no normal valve servers now. I've been playing this game since 2013 and i miss the old times.Now i got to wait 1 hour just to find a casual server.The pyro is just too overpowed and can kill a soldier and scout easily just by holding down w and holding down mouse one.And now its hard just to have fun in tf2
