8/10 would reccomend to someone who likes zombie games and building gamesPros:You can...build bases with your friends...fish (3.0 update)...hunt...eat berries...experience the euphoria of the berries (and the power)...snipe bandits (or random players if you're an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and need to blast somebody's head off to be socially satisfied)...walk around naked and ♥♥♥♥ people off...beg for food in the streets...there are just so many good things about this game. Too many to list here.Cons:I don't like how you can:die and lose 2+ hours of progress...be betrayed by your friend/s...get into a firefight with bandits who seem to have extreme gear...drive in a car and park it on a wooden floor/foundation and then it breaks...those are the only ones I could think of.Thank you to the readers who spent their time reading my review.Also a big thanks to Nelson Sexton for making the game.(8/10)
