Without looking at guides on how to play this game I delved right into the action and was immediately confused on what to do, so I quickly searched up a guide on steam and relaunched the game. 100% Orange Juice is a mix between a board game and a card game that is based primarily on luck and a little knowledge on how to play the game, this game has two ways of winning to gather enough stars and to beat enough enemies. To move on the board you roll a die, if you reach an intersection you are able to choose which direction you would like to go (After learning the tiles you can get the best out of your turns/chapters). There are different tiles on the board and an action is performed on each one that may benefit your game or hurt your game (Luck based) these include; gaining or loosing stars, versing creatures, Draw a card and battle. I found this game fun to play, however after playing more than 3 hours I found it very annoying how hard the ai is in this game, so I recommend only playing this with a mate who owns the game. The developer 'Orange Juice' used vibrant colours in the game and a refreshing art style that I have not seen by any other dev although the music is great it became very annoying after the third loop. Overall this game was fun to play, had extremely difficult ai, based upon luck, great visuals, tons of campaigns and content and great but catchy soundtrack. Not quite worth 6.99us asking price through for the content in this game however is definitely worth it if you have friends to play with. *Please do note that I have received this game for the purpose of reviewing it*
