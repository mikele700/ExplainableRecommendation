I have been playing this game from the begining before it entered steam. But I have switched into other games for a year. 3 weeks ago, i downloaded robocraft again and feeling so awesome with the new guns and items. But after this ******* loot update, hell yeah. Hell yeah i can build a castle with those 100000000+ bricks and blocks from the loots! And welcome to the railcraft. How awesome it is in the world of railgun.  Thank you developer, I am deleting this game with my friends together.
