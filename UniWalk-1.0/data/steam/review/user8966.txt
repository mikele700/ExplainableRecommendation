this game has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off more than anything else on my steam (and i own bad rats) but despite the numerous glitches the twelvie cod style community i just keep coming back, because despite all its flaws dayz is a truly amazing game. it has given me experiences no other game could e.g travelling with a stranger for almost 2 hours only for him to vanish on the ship and have me find his body 20 meters away, from walking into a church with my friend that was packed with people only to have us sit in a circle for 5 min and get killed by a single bandit and most recently cooking my first cow after almost starving to death.no game can give the experiences that dayz gives you. Its weird its almost like its countless glitches and horrible community make those positive experiences so much more memorible. Though features are needed, glitches need fixing because despite what i said prior there are countless games just waiting to take dayzs place so its a long road ahead and i really hope dayz doesnt get overshadowed by upcoming games like H1Z1 because deep down this is an amazing game
whilst the Rakyat parts are kinda crap the bits on the first island are amazing a great buy
