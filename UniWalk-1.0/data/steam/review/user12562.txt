-Coming up to 600 hours and still can-'t get enough. Frantic four player co-op, across a variety of different challenging and interesting heists. There-'s something for everyone, from stealth lovers to FPS adorers, everyone will have a blast! Would highly recommend!-
TL:DR - If you're a Borderlands fan, I would highly recommend this game! The game features a fantastic story, with meaningful choices that can impact the story, much like other Teltale games. The gamepaly is pretty basic, only featuring one or two puzzles throughout the entire game. With the gameplay being pretty basic, it allows the story to take centre stage. The characters throughout are amazing, with me either loving or loving to hate them. Lastly, the soundtrack for this game is fantastic, it sets the mood perfectly.The only gripe I had about the game was a minor sound bug during the end of Ep. 5, where character voices wouldn't play. But apart from that, it seemed pretty bug free!I can't believe I waited till just now to play it, it's one of the best games I've played in a good while!
-A classic with loads of fun to be had. Pick between nine unique and equally entertaining classes and go to town on everyone in your path. Not to mention the wide variety of different customization options available that ensures that YOU design the character you want. From hats that are on fire and to golden weapons, it-'s all here. Plus, it-'s Free2play, so why haven-'t you joined in on the fun!? Would highly recommend!-
I was pretty sceptical before buying this, primarily due to the episodic nature of the game. However, after playing I can say that I was somewhat happy that I bought the Introduction EP. Before going any further, I'd like to acknowledge the performance and server issues. I'm currently running a GTX 770, and I can say that the performance is alright, my FPS dips in certain places, but jumps back up to around 55-60 FPS. One major gripe for the performance is how certain graphical options are greyed out, depending on your system. I'm not a big fan of this, and would rather it just be removed and let someone select what option they want. Regarding server issues, they are to be expected on day one, but that doesn't make it much better. The major problem with the servers is that the game is ALWAYS ONLINE, meaning if you get disconnected you can and will get locked out of certain options, for example contracts mode, whilst disconnected. Furthermore, challenges and what not are also locked whilst disconnected. This is probably my major problem with the game thus far. However, gameplay wise the game is fantastic. Whilst playing I didn't personally encounter any bugs, and had fun trying out a couple different ways of assassinating the targets. The animations and sound design also appear quite fluid and nice. As I am writing this review, I was not able to try out the contracts mode, however if it is anything like the contracts mode in Hitman: Absolution it should be very good. Lastly, I understand that people are complaining about the episodic nature of the game, however I wouldn't consider that a negative in this review, as you should be well aware of that before going ahead with the purchase. Overall, once the performance and server issues are fixed, I can recommend a fan of the Hitman franchise to buy the introduction version of this game. I believe with the Paris level and contracts mode; the $15 USD is worth it. However, if you are not a Hitman fan, I suggest reading up on some more reviews and watching some gameplay before going ahead with a purchase. Lastly, I find it very hard to recommend the 'Full experience' version of the game, buying each EP. individually only ends up costing $5 USD extra, and is a much safer bet. I'll update this review if a performance patch is released, or when EP. 2 is released.Thanks for reading guys and gals.EDIT: Added some more thoughts are playing some more.
-Though it might be outdated, this doesn-'t mean there still isn-'t any fun to be had. You are dropped in the midst of a civil war, and tasked with finding the infamous weapon dealer -The Jackel.- With two large, open areas to explore, there is major fun to be had. Some may dislike the AI due to how old the game is, but still a minor problem on this fantastic game. I would recommend giving it a whirl.-Important note - This game is enhanced through -Dylan-'s Far Cry 2 Realism Mod.- Making it change -...from an Africa-based sedan and pickup truck simulator into a (semi accurate) African conflict simulator.- If you pick this game up on Steam, I highly suggest you install this mod.
