Even though this game feels like a massive money grab when it comes to the DLC, Its a great game to play with your mate's. 7/10
The Idea that this game is in beta blows my mind, there is enough content for a full game and there is MORE coming.Worth every cent !!!10/10
Good Game :)
Once you learn the basics it become very addictive
