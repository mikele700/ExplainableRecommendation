this game is defenately one that will never die,,, see what i did there,, ;) 9/10
What can be said about this game that hasnt already been said about the pope, i have this game on console as i had to purchase it because of this Windows 7 optimisation and later, problem on my end is i baught this on steam a long LONG time ago and was super excited to play it on my pc wich is a complete masterpiece, (PS4 pfft) at the time of my purchase there was ZERO notification about the spec problems, so i went on a hunt on how to fix the issue, after browsing YouTube a while i learned about the inability to actually play (I crash every time im born,)its hard to say wether or not this game should recieve a thumbs up or down, if you own a PC with XP, GET IT, however most people dont like running a pc on a hamster wheel, so all in all untill Betheda fix this issue, this gets my thumbs down.(ps, i know i cant spell lol)
