Team Fortress 2 is an FPS game made by VALVe, but you probably know that. It is a fast paced shoot'em-up that everyone will most likely enjoy. (Except for CoD ♥♥♥♥ who think it's crap because they can't snipe properly). With a variety of weapons and classes, and a brilliantly well thought out marketplace, I highly reccomend this game.
