You are thrown into a battlefield with a pain ball gun against people who spent all there mums money on the biggest gun in the game. Basicaly the only skill you need is the abbility to throw money at shity games or 2000 hours of free time. o yeah and theres tanks which your cant kill unless you are level 6 or some ♥♥♥♥ or money. so over unless you are a very rich man/woman this game is not for you. I say all this but i have 400 hours on warframe... but that games not pay to win :D.
♥♥♥♥ crashes on loading screens every game game good tho just fix it
