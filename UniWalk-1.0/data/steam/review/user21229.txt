It is a nice survival based game. You may have to build houses over and over again but you will eventually get a well protected house to put all your loot inside. Great and enjoyable game to play with your mates.
Favourite game from my childhood. Was very happy when it was released on steam.
The game that made my younger years enjoyable. Without the DayZ mod for this game, the game would not have become what is has become. This game was the birth and best of all survival games. Still haven't found Frankie...
A old but great game to develop team building skills with your friends. Sure can take your money away with trying to get good skins out of crates though. Spent a good $50 bucks within my first 20 hours of playing the game. May take your money but still a great game.
