First impressions, the game is pretty cool. I understand most people are having a startup errors and giving a rather bias opinion on a overall pretty decent game so I'll just set the cards on the table. The game's enviroment was a big plus for me. If you've played from 1 to Primal you'd realise the Farcry series is alot about the location aswell as gameplay. One thing I didn't quite get to begin with is that the game kind of throws you in and expects you to know what to do giving small tutorials on minor actions but no real perspective on what to do. If you've played 4 and 3 you'll see a pretty similar control scheme, so I'd say go into the game after catching up on your basic controls and you'll experience the game alot better. there are a bunch of new features to replace your old ones which I have a mixed opinion on so I'll leave that alone because nobody's opinion is greater than your own so If you want to experience the game for yourself. Overall I reccommend this to fans of the Farcry series but somebody jumping in newly I suggest trying the previous games out before purchasing this. Multiplayer would be good if it was there though
