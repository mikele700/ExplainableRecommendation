How good is this game? VERY Good.Not only has Ubisoft created this intense FPS, they have also managed to increase the player base over all 3 platforms (Xbox, Playstation and PC).Pro's:-Great Mechanics.-Somewhat realistic damage (1 headshot from any weapon will instakill)-Hit Detection is better than most game *cough* TF2 *cough*.-Steep learning curve. -Is not P2W.-BattlEye (anti-cheat).-Sounds.Why is a steep learning curve good? You won't get bored within 10 hours of gameplay. Now having said that you do have to unlock all your operators (you automatically have 1 free operator when you start, the recruit). The price of you operators will vary on your version of the game, for instance, if you have the starter edition all operators are 25k renown (100-600 per match, 100 if you were ♥♥♥♥ and 600 if you did will and a boost) and if you have the normal version your operators will cost 500 - 1000 - 1500 - 2000. <What does that mean? Your first operator will cost 500, and each successive operator will cost an extra 500 renown.Con's:-Connection problems.-I have never joined a server with less than 100 ping. (I'm in Australia so meh)-Rubber banding even at 100 ping.-Glare and buggy light.-Buggy collision (drones falling under maps and getting stuck in stairs.-People who don't have mics.Overall this game is 9/10.I recommend to get this game if you have a mic. Typing will get you killed.
Why get this game? Basically a MOBA TF2 -the hats are A LOT more cheap.This game will suck your money but it's totally worth it.With this game you will NOT need a girlfriend because ranked will ♥♥♥♥ you everyday for the rest of your life.You will need to get acquainted with the usual toxic players (Pinoys, Russians, South Americans...)Learn to support, GGWP.
