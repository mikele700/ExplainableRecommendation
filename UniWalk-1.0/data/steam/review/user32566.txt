Going into this game i was on the fence it had a lot of bad reviews and negative comments. I waiting till it was on sale and picked it up for 5$. What i got was a good suprise. IT took me roughly about 10 hrs to finish my frist playthrough and i will probably go for  another playthrough in the near future. I dont review games often but since all of the negativity this game is getting i thought i would put my opinion out there. I liked it alot and whish there was more like it out there. The decisions you make in this game are important and a lot of the time you will be stuck between a rock and a hard place and will have to make immoral decisions to make sure that you achive your goal, getting to San Verdano. This is a indie game and the writing is very witty and humourous at times but falls flat at others there are also a few typos here and there. This is a game about life and it may be a bit grindy at times but isnt normal life a grind going to a job from 9-5 on weekdays justo earn a living. This game is trying to simulate the same thing. To get to where you want you need to work hard while that nmay get boring in this game it is worth it to advance and go on your journey. There are multiple ending with the game but i was pretty happy with mine :) enjoy people this is a very underated gem.
