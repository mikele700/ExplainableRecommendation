First of all i completed the game in less then i day i spent so much time playing this, i found this game full of excitement from start to finish, secondly i dont care what people say this game was much better then arkham asylum and city anyday. Full stop this game iis worth everything it costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I thought this game was going to be pretty good as im a big fan of he show but it was even more then i could have hoped for, had a great yet stupid story, fun gameplay and endless amounts of fun. It really feels like your a part of the show!!!
I know alot of people will disagree but the community is really bad, the gam requires a larger graphics card then one that can run the new batman game, so far its a horrid experience, i hope it gets better!!
This game is amazing great plot and gameplay there is but only one bad thing it requires to high a graphics card as i can run the latest batman game (arkham origins) better then i can run this game which is abit sad, still great game!!
Just perfect, this game doesnt really need a review as its common sense to know its awesome BUT IT NOW!!!!!!!!
BUY IT NOW
