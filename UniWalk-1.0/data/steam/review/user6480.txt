How dare they want money for their product! I mean, we only put LOTS OF PRESSURE ON THEM! for 5 YEARS! Something they originally weren't going to and probably DIDN'T wanna do. But they did. So how dare they be so greedy! Now that my sarcasm is over, you guys seem like the greedy ones. Oh, and those complaining about the saves. You can apparently transfer your saves from GFWL. In the options menu. Just don't know how to make the option available. Google could probably tell you. I very much enjoyed the game. DLC is worth the price, I feel. There's enough content. c: (And if it is impossible, despite the fact there is an option, then I apologize for that part.)
I tried to enjoy this game. May not have played long, but it took less than that for me to get bored. And I usually enjoy games similar to this. Not worth paying anything. Sorry Devs.
