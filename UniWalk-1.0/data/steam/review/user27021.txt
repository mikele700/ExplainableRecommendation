Fun,Exicting,Great Singleplayer and Multiplayer,Usless Bots = AWESOME game!
You run around almost naked trying to find pigs that give you chicken and then get killed by other naked people with rocks over their head. 10/10!
I've been playing AOE1 and AOE2 since i was 5, i thought it was awesome then. NOW ITS IN HD W/ MULTIPLAYER!!! WELL DONE MICROSOFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mean as gameplay but takes a while to get used to if you play things like COD or Battlefield.
Played this game since i was 5 and imma still loving it! Great game to have in the back pocket and the game isnt spoiled by overdone graphics!
