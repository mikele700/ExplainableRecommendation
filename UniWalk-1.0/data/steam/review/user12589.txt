Other then the fact that the game crashes, lags, hasnt worked for months at a time, doesnt show textures and assets, resets resolutions everytime I launch it and generally hates all AMD users and about half of the Nvidia users, its pretty decent.
You laugh, you cry, you laugh again10/10
An extremely good game.
