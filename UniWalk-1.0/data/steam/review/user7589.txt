It's a fairly decent game. I like the storyline and the gameplay is sweet although it does have some flaws. To be completely honest, this didn't feel like a mafia game. It just felt like some generic action game with continuous shootouts. I honestly believe they could of done a better job at making a mafia related game. The driving can be a little bit of a pain sometimes. Apart from all that, it's alright. I give it a 7/10.
Not a bad game. I had quite a lot of fun with this one. I have never played any of the other Max Paynes (but that is likely to change after beating this awesome game) so I don't know how it compares to the other ones. I really think the bullet time and slow motion sequences are extremely unique and fun. Even though it's a great game, it still has its flaws. The first thing I have to say is; when you first open the game, you have to sign into the Social Club and all this other annoying rubbish. I already had a SC account but it wouldn't work on the game for some reason so I had to go through the trouble of making another account and linking it with the game etc. So in other words...IT'S A REEEEAL PAIN! The game is a bit choppy and has a quite a few glitches which occur here and there. A lot of the times, I found myself having to restart the game because of these glitches. It also tends to freeze sometimes during the cutscenes which really annoys me. In conclusion, it's a great, action packed game with loads of fun and I definitely recommend it. I give it an 8.5/10.
