Highly recommned this game. Underated goodness! get amongst it
This is the most fun I have had playing an FPS since the 90's Highly recommend if your are into team based tactical games. Not for the COD lone wolves. Get amongst this game well worth it :D
Rubbish. Lack of 2D cockpits has no real world application and unless you have a 100 000 setup like that which is foudn in some flying schools it's not worth getting for anything more than having fun.
Absolutely fantastic game. Definitely a bit different to what i typically play but definitely captivating. Recommend!
Fwoah yeah!!!
