Nope.
This game is very unique, and interesting, that's all I can really say about this game. You really should get it and play it for yourself, it's free, has good humour, and if you enjoyed The Stanley Parable, like I did, you will definately enjoy this.
Despite how much this game mindf***s you, it's a really fun, addictive, and hard game with very good music that fits with the levels. I recommend this game for those indie gamers out there who like a real challenge. It's worth the money I spent on this game.
