The feels. I have never cried that much on a game... ever. I feel the meaning of this game is to teach you a lesson. A lesson on how your choices will make a big change in your life. And that whatever choice you make, you should never feel bad about. Because trying to fix it will make you regret it.Spoiler here, so don't hover over this unless you have finished the game. --> I have played both endings (Both made me cry) and they are really good endings, but to be honest (In my opinion) letting Arcadia Bay get destroyed is a bit more of a happy ending between Max and Chloe as they leave Arcadia Bay, probably to go to Seattle with Max's parents. (Just a guess)But the game is beautiful with lots of different choices that you can make, I love the graphics, it looks as if someone painted and drew it all.. There is so much to say about this game but, this is isnt a really long review going over every little thing, because I don't dig that.. But this is my opinion about the game.. But I deeply suggest you buy this game, it really changes the way you think or feel about things or choices in life.. And in a good way
The best, game I've ever uninstalled.
