A game where case openings and high level skins make people rock hard and probably react so hard that the finebros will strike their videos. russians bend me over and call me a noob ♥♥♥♥boi (atleast i think thats what they said). I also get to achieve my life long dream of being a member of ISIS and ofcourse the best part of this game, i get to move my pointer over an enemy and shoot at them (preferably headshots you filthy scrubs). In all serious though, this game is really addicting and i can't wait to get gud. Dust/10
