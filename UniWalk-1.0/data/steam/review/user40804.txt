Really enjoyable single player, but now that gamespy is gone, there is no multiplayer servers up :(
Pretty good multiplayer.
Its living off of the tf2 items, but its a fun game in its own right.
The second best co-op game (behind L4D) around. Funny and thought engaging.
IMO one of the best RPG's ever, a must play.
I really like this game, but I couldn't find the stupid cake.
For a free game, It could be much worse
Apart from it being censored here in Australia, there is nothing bad I can say about this game
great for people willing to put time into mastering its tools.
Just simply the most fun you can have online.
