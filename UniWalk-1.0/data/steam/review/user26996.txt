Really did not like this game and not just because of the difficulty. Jolting camera angles and tells you Xbox controls. It's like it's completely disregarded PC. Played 41 minutes and got instantly confused and bored as well.Sorry to any fans of this game but holy ♥♥♥♥, it sucks.
Was a good game, until I had problems with it crashing frequently. But I'm not going to let that get in the way of what the game actually is.You'll hear this a lot on many other games but the graphics on THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING INCREDIBLE! Gameplay is extremely engaging and has a non-Cliche storyline.And just the fact Wolfenstein: The New Order is based in the early 1900's and contains... What was it... Oh yeah... ♥♥♥♥ING ROBOTS!And to make it EVEN BETTER! NAZIS!!!!!!!So, this game is cliche... But not.Get it.
Launch it. 2 logos popped up. Crashed. Couldn-'t tab out. Crtl+Alt+Delete. Task Manager. Not running in there. Sign out of my PC and close everything. Log back into Steam. -Bad Rats - Running-. Sign out and in again. -Bad Rats - Running-.Bad Rats better be ♥♥♥♥ing running or they won-'t see a sequel.
Absolutely amazing. Made well over 100 videos with this software and having waaaaaay too much fun with it. Does everything you need it to do and more.Put simply, I love it, and so will you.
