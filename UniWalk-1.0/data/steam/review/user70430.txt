The game has lacking in every aspect.Unfavorable.Still a pretty impresive effort when considering only one man developed the whole Dead Bits game.Dubstep and unity engine fans might take a look at it.Overall boring.
The first -ZOMBA- -  Zombie Online Multiplayer Battle Arena as they say it.A genuinely good MOBA set-up.Nicely polished and practically bug free.The best Dead Island game.While maintaining a lot of simple bashing-n-shooting of the core series games, Epidemic takes enough of the MOBA to give some strategic excitement.
One of the best competitive games of all times.One of the best first person shooters available right now.The game has a unique character thanks to the required combination of tactical insight and pure skills.The awesome old-school shooter has convinced us that Counter-Strike franchise is in no way to be forgotten.Global offensive will always be a multiplayer classic for those who are keen to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.
