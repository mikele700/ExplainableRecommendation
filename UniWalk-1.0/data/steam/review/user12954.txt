The game is great. Story line makes sense, flows through out the game with side missions you can do too.Graphics are great. Overall decent game, it pretty good...except!IT is a load of Bull**** to run it through ubisoft, their client sucks! Constantly annoying with -we reccommend- or -Game pattern change-, the best part, sign up and we send you junk..with more junk!Download far cry to steam to load up another game client to then lauch far cry back through steam! WTF!I buy games on steam to play through steam with no strings or third party launcher to -'verify-' i own the game.Really? you buy the game, download it launch to ubisoft own client to sign up, verify key, then run the game through steam...CUT OUT THE MIDDLE MAN! Removed the game and the ubisoft launcher. Its malware for all i care, added software i didn-'t intend for.[END RANT]*insert potato here*
