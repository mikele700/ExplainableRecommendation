Starbound is a great game for players who prefere a less instense gaming style. Starbound has one of the best in game sound tracks you will probably ever find. with calm music for exploring the abundants of planets this game has to offer to faster music for boss fights or enemy encounters. The thing i liked most about Starbound is the massive selection of different weapons and in game items. You will find yourself quickly exploring numerous planets in search of coal to fuel your spaceship to travel to other planets and solar systems. The way the planets in the game are randomly generatd complements this games exploraion and progressive difficulty and i would highly reccomend ths game to other players who would like a calmer, deeper experience in their games.
