Hack at a dead rabbit with a pickaxe to get raw chicken and cloth. The best part is that there's both PVP and PVE servers each with their own mods and communities. If you don't like spawning and dieing a lot and want to play the game normally, find a good PVE server with damage off and no raiding. Otherwise, go nuts on a pvp server and show everyone your doodle. Fun for the whole family!
