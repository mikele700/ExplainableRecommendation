THIS GAME IS AWESOME
Awesome game, Great DLCs and awesome guns!!!
OMG, this is probably one of the most fun and tense stealth games right now. I know, you might say Assassins creed might be better but thats not really a stealth games anymore as it does not punish you if you do not use stealth. However this game does.Now, if you do not like heavily stealth-focused games, DO NOT buy this game as it heavily relies on stealth.The game is SO fun and I highly recommend you picking this game up.The most fun part is probably the parts when you stealth kill a guy from above or using your blink ability to get around a guy and then finally come up to him and show `em who`s boss.Every moment in this game is always tense. At some heavily-guarded parts of the map, I could feel my hand sweating as I use my -'vision- ability to spot enemies.This game highly encourages you to expore the map as you find potions and runes to heal yourself and upgrade your badass character.(By the way your character, Corvo, is probably the least -face-seen- as he barelys shows his face in the game-'So, to wrap it all up, this game is a really really awesome game and if you are thinking about getting this game, stop hesitating and buy gmae, NOW. If you like stealth and dark games, GET IT NOW! Thank you! (づ￣ ³￣)づ
Do I recommend this game? YES YES YES. Talk about good gameplay, and an awesoem storyline. This game is mosty better than AC, AC2, AC3 an ACR in my opinion. But, AC4 will win it. On the other hand, if you do not have a computer that cannot run AC4, than this game is the AC game for you. Putting the ridiculously OP counter aside, the battling part of the the game is still decent. The free roam adds more gameplay time in this game, which is always good. Of course, the part where you can recruit assassins is so good. It`s just like AC4, but with assassins, not pirates. So, all around, it is a good game. :)
