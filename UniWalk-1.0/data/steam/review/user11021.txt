good game and lots of fun
Ive bought this game when there was a sale of 15% off a year ago, expecting that the full game will come soon at that time. and a year after i bought that game, the full game is not yet out...I recommend this game to my friends, if only we could play... but its still a overall fun game to play with when your bored and you want to beat the living crap out of someone and this is the game to play, i just hope that the bot had an Ai so that it could fight back to make things more interesting.Still waiting on the full game...
Addicting game, though its hard to control but alot of laughs and cool easter eggs in this game, hope there will be more operations soon as this game deserves a 5 star rating
Fun and a bit laggy even with my gaming pc but still fun :S
Very Fun Game that anyone would love
Its A really Really Lovely game just like space craft
CS:GO is a really fun game to play with friends, with the competetive and the casual gameplay makes an outstanding gameplay, not to mension the graphics of the game are outstanding, keep up the good work valve for the up coming skins and updates, thanks for an awesome game
