Being a qualified professional horse trainer is great, but it's not about how much light your horse can shine from its ♥♥♥♥, nor is it about how many races you win, its about how much YOU love your ponies and how much time YOU spend with them. This game is excellent, but before you buy it, I think you should consider the fact that it requires more of your time than a hardcore MMO addiction. It can take weeks to train just one of your horses to it's maximum level, and we all know that you need a lot more than just one horse to beat this game!You might be wondering how I am making these claims with only ~2 hours gameplay time. The truth is, I usually play this game while in Afghanistan on deployment, where I don't have an active internet connection and have to use Steam in offline mode. It's a great game to play with all my mates in the military, and it takes our mind off the horrible war that we are fighting. I highly recommend this to everyone that wants to play the best horse breeding/training sim out there. As I mentioned, it takes up a lot of your time, but in my opinion, it is well worth it!
