Before reading this review understand this will not focus on the story line as I am unable to complete it due to the issues you will read about below.Well for a start I was looking forward to JC3 for awhile, However with this so called -End product- I am left ashammed if anything else. By this point we as gamers should stop thinking that the next big game rlease will be any better they seem to just stagnate and only improve how awful the bugs are. asfar as my copy of JC3 was concerned I was plagued by Camera glitches, graphical crashes at every cut scene I came too, graphic driver crashes even with the latest driver updates and  high end rig. I put a question finally to the developers of JC3, Avalanche Studios in the vain hope you are reading this my question is simple. Is the sheer lack of incompetence of your marketing team or that of your development/testing teams that pushed this clearly still unfinished game out? I see a good few hundred people commenting on this games community hub forums here on steam about bugs and such within the game and those posts have a host of comments, you would think that these bugs that seem to be so very obvious got shipped with the final releasse copy only due to someones own incompetence.In summery at the time of writing this review I strongly recommend you spend  your money elsewhere as it seems it is a game of russian roullette on whether your copy is plagued by bugs as most youtubers seem to have perfect copies (Again that could be just them simply editing bugs out). Too everyone who reads this no matter who you are or what genre you partake of please remember, games that are released like this with a multitude of bugs should not be celebrated and should be held to account for its short comings and to game devs out there as it should be abundantly clear to you already, releasing a mess like this can be avoided if you take the time to test your product thourghly I suggest spending more time to do so in the future Avalanche.
