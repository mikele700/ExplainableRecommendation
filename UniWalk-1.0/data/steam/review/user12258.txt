Great Game I Love It 10/10
I See a game thats looks awesome but i dont like the graphics
10/10 would leave my friend outside the fortress again
10/10 Would See Jumbo Jets Everywhere
A Really fun game. But too many DLC. I'll give it. 7/10EDIT : Welp nevermind about that 7/10 thingy.... but really overkill... SKINS F**KING SKINS. I'd rather play CS:GO Or TF2 Rather than this ill give it 2/10
A Great game. Highly recommended
