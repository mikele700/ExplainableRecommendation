Right off the bat and pretty obviously - This Game NEEDS to be longer! Just look at all the reviewer's gametime, despite it being around 1hour average *We Have ALL Finished The Game*.What makes this game so brilliant is how nostalgic it makes its Audience feel, this isn't some knockoff Half-Life 2 mod were you're doing random junk on the acclaim that the G-Man has let Gordan Freeman take the day off, this game managed to replicate the atmosphere and pacing that the Half-Life series did so well and of coarse the Concussion Gun was such a brilliant addition that I felt HL2 should utilise it.
