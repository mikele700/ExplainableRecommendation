The Division is a very good smooth game, very tactical. One of the bad things are it takes literally 2 whole mags depending on your gun to kill someone and the graphics are alright but not Great, the game is still worth a try! I've only played like 2 hours on PC but PS4 is great lmao
SUCKS!
THis shouldn't even be free it's so cool but yeah I like it SO MUCH!
This game is like realy good I LOVE IT!
Good game
