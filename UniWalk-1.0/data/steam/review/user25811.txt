Ticks all the boxes, if you have boxes for Hitler, dinosaurs, and David Hasselhoff.Added crazy kung fu fight scenes, -'vikings-', and -'80s cop-movie plot. Great soundtrack too.And, of course, it-'s free.-Yeah, that-'s my bicep- - Kung Fury
I quite like this game. It's very satisfying because of all the explosions and slow-mo and stuff.
