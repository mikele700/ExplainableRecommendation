Made me kill my whole family.10/10
The game is broken, there are hackers everywhere and it's just really boring.I wouldn't waste your money on this.
A very hard game to start getting into but overall it's a fun game and I would reccomend that you buy it!
One of my favourite games.Gr8 M8 I R8 8/8
I bought an Oculus Rift just so I could play this game and get closer to my dreams11/10 for almost real catgirls
This is my favourite game of all time! It's my most played game, I used to love the first Planetside and the fact that this is free to play makes it even better. I would recomend this game. Thanks SOE
This game is complete cancer.I would rather drink bleach than play this.Call of Duty is pretty much dead at this point.Don't waste your money on it.
