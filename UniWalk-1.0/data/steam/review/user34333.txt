The game just turned into ♥♥♥♥ from a shiny bright star up in the space.Oh... PAYDAY... What have happened to you?OVERKILL has ruined this. With only 5GB worth of weapon skins with attributes. How many time did they take to this? Not even a day, and the community has flipped the table.M-I-C-R-O-T-R-A-N-S-A-C-T-I-O-N-S, because this was the only thing the game was needing, right?Not only because this game already had a ♥♥♥♥♥on of U$5 DLC (not saying it-'s wrong, it-'s a really good way to do marketing tho, with DLC that isn-'t really necescessary to the gameplay, it-'s TOTALLY optional), they needed to add microtransactions as of another way of earning money.I GUESS OVERKILL IS TRYHARDING TO BE VALVE REALLY BAD IN HERE.[imgur.com]Not only bad as of the skins, rumors running over /r/paydaytheheist and /vg/ that PDTH heists are coming TEMPORARY to PAYDAY 2. This is good right? Well, the bad comes now......As the last day of the crimefest, they will extend the -free weekend- PAYDAY 2 experience forever. That-'s right, PAYDAY isn-'t just turning P2W as of today (microtransaction skins have special attributes!), but it will turn F2P in some days.My final word? Well, I put a lot of effort on this game. Not wasting only my time by playing it, but interacting with the community, helping and creating as many content I could aswell, I just hoped that the game didn-'t break apart like this.Just one tip to OVERKILL: As of always, LISTEN TO YOUR COMMUNITY.Edit:As a protest, not only by me, but from a really good part of the community, some actions are being taken to show OVERKILL our opinion.* Not playing PAYDAY 2 | Current players[steamcharts.com]* Taking a down review of the game on steam* Tagging the game as -microtransactions- on steamAnd just as reminder on microtransactions, there-'s this article[www.gamespot.com], this one[i.imgur.com], and this[i.imgur.com], all written by Almir Listo himself._____SOURCES OF 4CHONG/REDDIT LEAKS:PDTH Heists/Gun skins (this post is as of yesterday 6AM)[puu.sh]COMPLETELY OVERKILL Pack special stuff is totally going to be a exclusive skinPAYDAY 2 FREE TO PLAY[imgur.com]

SpeedRunners is an awesome game.While it mixes up the playstyle of Super Meat Bot, it also adds the speed of a racing game, the power-ups of any mario kart game and the grapple hook mechanism similar to the Just Cause series.The main plot of the game is cool, while there's a lot of main characters, there's still 2 Youtuber packs (which I find waaay unescessary to have, since they're only reskins and the players have no audio or anything, it's just visual), there's hidden characters too, while you can play as Wolf from PAYDAY 2 and as a potato.The game can be played up to 4 players, on an online match, or you can play with bots, choosing one of the three difficulties: Easy, medium or hard.Even that the game is competitive and smooth, it doesn't and won't lack the sense of fun. Just like in Mount Your Friends, if it wasn't by the hanging dongs and the nude characters, the game would be totally focused on the competitiviness it has, while in SpeedRunners, the game has a gayish character with a pink unicorn costume, and another character with a big red ball head with a star on it, symbolizing the comunism.The game has a nice plot, by first sight, since it involves all of an hero world where you need to save scientists from bombs.93/100
On Catacombs, Mr. Foster just yelled so loud: NANANANANANANANA BATMAN! This game is so gold.______________________________________________________ THIS WON'T BE MY ACTUAL REVIEW, I WILL CHANGE THIS AS SOON AS I'M DONE MY TESTS ON THE GAME.
