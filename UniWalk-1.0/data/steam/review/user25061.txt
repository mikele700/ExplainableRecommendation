Going to get straight to the point- Takes a while to get into it- Once you're in and have gained more survivors it's really fun- In the time that I've played I have only discovered 2 bugs- You really need to save before going into combat because you'll probably die- I didn't think that a zombie game could pull off this angle and turn based stratergy combat but I was wrong- Upgrading your shelter is important and should be top priorityI'd rate the game 8/10
I would rather watch the new fantastic four movie while sliding a shard of glass up my d*ck hole than figure out how the f*ck to move a space ship. 0/10 - F*ck yourself

This game is not for the light hearted. This game is very brutal, the carnage in which you can induce upon not only your passengers but other people on the road is insane. If you like GTA V or games of that manner you will LOVE. L.O.V.E. LOVE this game. It features all of your favourite mechanics including; Blinkers, screaming children, red lights and death. Please keep in mind that this game is not for young people, if you are under the age of 17 you should ask your parents first.I personally have not played much time in this game and I already think that it's great9/10 - Chubby Swag
I got this game for free and it was still too expensive, It was kind of alright I guess but it was far too broken. Zombies spawned far too much and the controls for the helicoper are SO SO SO SO ♥♥♥♥. The trailer and screenshots are so missleading, it looks like a great survival game but all I got was a failed Left 4 dead with ♥♥♥♥ gamemodes.
The game is awesome and the community pushes its boundaries and makes it beyond incredible. Over 100 gamemodes made by fans, over 10,000 mods made too. Grab yourself a copy and play it today
