They done ♥♥♥♥ed up
In the two days I have owned this game I have expereienced diplomacy, tribal dancing and chaanting, heartbreak and betrayal, heated firefights, pretending to be Robin Hood and a covert base raid. This game is what DayZ should have been, the gunplay is fantastic, the crafting is deep and immersive and most importantly, the community is fun. never before have I been able to have amusing and lengthy conversations with other armed players without beig shot at. In conclusion, if I had $50 to spend on DayZ and Rust, I would buy two copies of Rust.
