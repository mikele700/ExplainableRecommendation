It's similar to Pokemon. You gotta collect them all. Except you collect hats not pokemon.
It's cheap and fun. With a coupon or a special sale, it's definitely worth it.
It's amazing how there either constantly smiling or being unhappy. Loved it. 10/10
It's one of those games which is really interesting for some people while really boring for others. I was one of those who found it fun since I'm a fan of puzzle-platformers and enjoy exploration games as well.
