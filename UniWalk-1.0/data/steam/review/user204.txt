quit my job 8 months ago to play this game full time, woke up 8 in the morning today to regret my decision. suffering from bouts of depression and mood swings due to lack of human contact to the outside world and friend, as i look back and reflect upon my life and my future; i come to a epiphany:  10/10 still worth it.
