This game is an amazing strategy, i find myself constantly communicating with people to get to the objective. the skins system is a great extra and a fun little thing that makes you want to play the game more.
This game no longer has its own feeling. i had played the original ace of spades and it was an amazing game, it was unique and had almost a nostalgic feel to it. now the game lacks in players and is no longer as fun. i would pay to play the older game!
great game for free building and making friends!
PLAY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
