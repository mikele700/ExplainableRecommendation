Great game, 10/10. I've been playing smite for a while now, and now that's it's on Steam... Unique camera angling, which makes the game so much more immersive, and topped off with hvaing to aim most abilities and all basic attacks just makes it all more the fun. The use of gods is also another great aspect of the game and a variety of gamemodes. Using steam wallet is another handy thing too. Very much recommend you give it a go.
1000/10, it's just amazing. Nothing else to say
