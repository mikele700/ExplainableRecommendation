Co-op is a lot of fun, and there are a lot of different upgrades and customisations for your guns and turrets. Despite this, it feels like there just isn't enough variation in the game. I recommended it because of the fact that you can kill your friends by dropping turrets from the heavens onto their unsuspecting heads, which is a lot of fun. Buy it on sale.
