Pretty good game to party up with friends and have a great time, the graphics are pretty smooth and nice looking and the navigation and shooting is done pretty well definately worth the money. But then again i only bought it for $10 on sale a few months ago and bought Gage weapon pack #1 and #2 and the courier mod pack on steam summer sale. $30 is a pretty average price for the game.
Very Nice great story and alot of freaky and scary moments 8/10. Also the graphics are pretty damn great.
Not a bad game i think it's one of the best truck simulator's i've played even though i don't like cab over trucks a whole heap but still a very nice smooth game and the ultra graphics are nice. Nice Job
This game truly amazing it may be pre alpha but i haven't had many problems with it this is possibly one the best pre alpha games i have ever played.This game gives you a glimpse of what a apocalytic struggle would be like. You choose whether you want to fight along through the struggle with people that are friendly other survivors or you can fight with people that kidnap, steal and kill other survivors (bandits) you choose.
This game is an absolute masterpiece if you mentally ****** in the head. This game needs so much development and it is not even up to alpha standards. Wouldn't mind getting my $'s back. Wouldn't play it if it was a free to play.
Very nice game i played arma 2 and arma 2 operation arrowhead and they have step it up really nicely the multiplayer server engines could be a bit better but apart from that it's a masterpiece of Fps games.
This game is good fun. It is like most survival games where it is better to play with friends. I lke the rp aspect of game, sure the game still needs work but that is what alpha is. The devs are doing a great job so far.  10/10 IGN
