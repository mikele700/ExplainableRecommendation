it simply does NOT follow the rules. i am currently RAGING because i lost a game because i blocked in a VERY SPECIFIC order only to have it switched and DIE!!!.i got this for practice when i can't use my IRL cards, but it simply does NOT follow the rules. if this was fixed i would happily use it as a COMPLETELY FREE and ONLINE alternative.
