It's really good. A little difficult to get into at first but worth it. Amazing tech tree, like a spider web. I loved that when you are fighting an AI player their units are different to yours because they have chosen a different path in the tech tree. AMD graphics card is still producing slightly shaky graphics; live in hope that they're going to fix this one day. Ironic because the game starts with an AMD splash. Also, no score or monument produced at the end of the game - I mised that. Overall, though, worth the money and an excellent game. It isn't Alpha Centauri II and it it isn't Civ-lite. It's a whole new experience.
Totally addictive - after 40 hours of playing, I'm still returning to try and get those goods to Dubai on time. The game starts well, introducing you to small loads and quick trips. You don't realise it expanding around you as Northern Europe sends goods to the Mediterranean and North Africa. And then you're sending goods to America on bigger and bigger ships. Just when you think you're safe, the Investor comes and takes her cut and suddenly you're scrabbling for money. Do you risk taken the dubious goods for the Don? Of course you do, you're desparate for income and here comes the Customs to catch and fine you...It's more challenging than it seems and building your shipping line is more satisfying than you'd think. It's the exact example of powerful gameplay over expensive graphics.
