The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is a Rogue-like, indie that has a TON! of replay value. I mean sure it's basically  just the same thing over and over again but some how it just feels different everytime you go in for another run. To me thats good game design. If I had one criticism with this game it would have to be that this game is pretty much 100% luck. Your items decide your run and you can get f***** over real bad!  this game is flippin AMAZING and you should go buy it right now! 9/10 Do it...go buy...
THIS GAME IS GLORIOUS! Robbaz
