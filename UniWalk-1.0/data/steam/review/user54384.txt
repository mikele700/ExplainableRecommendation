♥♥♥♥ this is like titanfall with bigger, better and more baddass mechs and less time waiting for your bloody titan too be ready. Though it could do with some graphics improvements. On ULTRA with every setting on or maxed i still got over 120 fps. AMAZING
Best Competitive FPS.Having had little experience with CS, this sort of game was new to me, and at first, it seemed like a pointless grind, boring, only fun with friends.I quit, 6 months later I return, to find myself a SIlver 1 scrublord, yet despite this, it has grown on me.I cant turn on my PC and open steam without thinking, screw anything else, I want to play CS:GOBasically this is how it works.Get Kill with P90-You ♥♥♥♥ing son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ noob scrub, what a noob wepDie with p90-ha you gay ♥♥♥♥, you had noob weps and you failed, hahahahaKill with AK acrros long distance- U ♥♥♥♥ing aimbotting ♥♥♥♥Get KIll through smoke-Wallhacks ♥♥♥♥ off noob, go back to deathmatchMiss easy AWP shot- are you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? AWP is so noob, you suck ballsWell thats how it basically works, just remember its just a game (despite how competitive it is),and remember have fun, communicate with your team, and be friendly.GLHF xD
Good game, getting old now though. When Brotherhood of Arms was announced in 2011 i was so happy, now im ♥♥♥♥♥♥. BUT tf2 is a great game for those who k=lack the skill for CSS or CSGO. Its good fun, hopefully valve makes a new multiplayer fps title, whatever it may be by 2015
This is great and it has some seroisly fun muliplayer. I know ArmaIII is out, but youll get a lot better performance with 2, You'd preffer it unless you have dual Nvidia Ge-Force GTX-Titan Super OC Edition II
AMAZING. Terraria, but ten times better.
Excellent game but wehen will it have an official/proper release?
great game where u can get everything thats good for FREE
