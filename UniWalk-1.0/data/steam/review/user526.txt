This is a great game. with a single problem that could maby be fixed. the problem is simply because of the way the game seems to generate the levels to match the music is programed to generate levels based on 4:4 timing  (i dont know how to type that the correct way) so if you have something that is in a different time like 3:4 then your may not get a good level, the game does inform you if its not comfident in the timing. granted this may not seem like a major problem but i think if it was fixed it would allow more songs to be played well, and possibly making more people happy with the product. but i give the game 7/10 and if this could be fixed/coded into the game then it would get a 10/10 from me np.PS i know my Grammer is something terribal.
Great game i find the systerm designer a bit buggy tho however i would recommend this game to any RTS fan or a fan of games in genreal
Civ 5 is a great game however I think it is best to play with a bunch of freinds in a muiltyplayer match this is because the AI is abit bugged in some ways so I would suggest MP with out a doubtPS:I suck at Spelling
