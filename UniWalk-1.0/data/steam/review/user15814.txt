best strategy game ive played to date, frikin SPACESHIPS!!typical game:Build colony ship and 5combat ships (any) and colonisecolonisecolonisebuild researchresearchfound enemyget Rektexperiment with diferent shipsget Rektthrow PC out of windowget Rekt (im not great at this game)find good ship comboenemy sends titan (get Rekt)find out religious nuts have revolted (get rekt)loyalty on capital 0% (loose game Get REEEKKKTTT!!!!!!!)10/10 though cause i love the gamealso it has halo mod so yay
the game has been fun so far, i think adding some music would help people enjoy the game.also i think that changing it so that your ship folows the mouse rather than relying on the arrow keys would make the game easier to play. (you dont have to negate the crappy stearing of large ships)fun and will keep playing
-god damnit clide that was like your one job-and after that: ♥♥♥♥ JUST GOT REAL!!!!fun comedic and quite adult, all in all great game10/10 would give abortions again
Awesome Turn based strategy, i play with my freinds all the time and my PC learns to fly every time i dont launch the spaceship10/10PS: Ghandi isnt that bad if you wipe him out early
awesome gamethe AIs target and team up on the player(s) and it makes FFA with AI dificultother than that, awesome (look at the water, isnt that water pretty)10/10 would be killed by school girls again
this game is awesome beyond compare from the items and content to the bosses.my friends and i used to play the game all the time at school.we had illegal copies but we all bought the game on steam afterwards so unexpected advertising.ive acctualy played 100 hours plus of this as ive played it since when it first came out.it has been amazing to say the least and ive worked very hard to stay ahead of my freinds in boss and item progressthe game content has reportedly been finished with the moonlord update but the game is still being updated with better mod support and a creative mode among other things10/10  Would underestimate cthulu againEDIT: EXPERT MODE IS BS
amazing game already, riding different dinos to help tame ever more dinos. soon you have a horde of little dinos and big dinos that make you practicly invincible. you can even tame giant birds and fly accross the islandmy PC cant run the game on full graphics so i dont get the full experience but riding raptors is awesomeEDIT: THEY FIXED THE FPS ISUES! now my medicore PC can run at 40 FPS rather than 15they are constantly updating the game with new tools, weapons, and creatures.it has become a very polished game and there are tons of mods for almost any desire!10/10 would be eaten againPS: if your new then choose to spawn in the south as its the easiest place to survive.
this game has evolved considerably in the last couple of years, with new weapons and gamemodes becoming available. the game is an action packed shooter where you get to design your own awesome robots (or just make a toilet or somthing) you can also check out what other people have made which is awesome.alot of people have gripes about changes to the game, tech points for instance were once integral to the game as they alowed you to unlock parts. currently the game unlocks new items when you reach a new level, which i like.the new weapon combos you can get are very interesting, Blink Drives and Disc Shields can completley change the tide of battle, many people have missile launchers and SMGs so they can pick off other players from a distance.alot of hate for the game arises from their 10 second regen addition as many argue it makes medics obsolete. medics can heal you instantly and can increase battlefield survivability significantly, the 10 second rule is only there so people dont get permenantly shut out of the game. i like the game but it isnt perfect and it probably could do with some changes but it is still one of my favorite games to play.9/10 would die again
