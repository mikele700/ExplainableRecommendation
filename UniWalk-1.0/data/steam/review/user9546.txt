Nothing to say.Just everything.
I remember playing the original Dooms when I was little... I have to say, this isn't a disappointment. I love BFG Edition. Reminds me of all the good times I'd hide behind the couch and watch as my father played.
Simple game. Rage inducing, but strangly addicting.Such a gem, and at a cheap price.
Wonderfully touching. A brilliant story-telling FPS.
It's amazing. It explains everything that happens in Portal 2, if you don't get any of the references.
Really fun. And there's Co-op too.
