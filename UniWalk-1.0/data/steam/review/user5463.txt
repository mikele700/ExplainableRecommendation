Really fun game if you play with friends, I'm not experiencing any glitches in the game at all and I am having the greatest of fun! This game, I think is worth a buy, definitely!
I played this game 4 months after it was released (I played in 2012) and I loved it, but unfortunately I had to stop playing after my launcher wouldn't allow me to play the game, so I stopped altogether.I thorougly enjoyed this game when I played it, even though I was bad at it, it was still a great game to play every now and then.I personally give this game a 8.9/10There are just some bad things I didn't like about Blacklight: Retribution, but it was still a good game overall.
