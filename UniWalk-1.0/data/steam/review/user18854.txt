Beta reviewSummary: 8/10Review:Awesomely fun game with a good twist on the mmo design.This game with its 120 classes and 21 professions is a joy to play with strangers and friends alike however at the point of this review the game feels a litttle pay to win with you being able to pay gems and getting higher tier mounts and gliders at the start of the game. The labour points is a necessary evil as it stops the economy from being flooded by useless items at launch as so many games have. Its graphics are quite good but are bound to get better as it goes into open stateThe classes are fun and chaotic. Many build have no chance of working while some require a little tweaking to work. They all feel quite solid on their own and allow fun strategys between friends. Last mention:Wait till release when its f2p at the end of the year
