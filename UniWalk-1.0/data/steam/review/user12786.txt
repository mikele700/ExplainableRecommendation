TL;DR last paragraphFor a second lets forget about the: Awful optimisation Game straight up not working on some computers The developers lyingIf you want to more about these issues be sure to take a look at other reviews and look online, there will be plenty of people complaining about it (and rightfully so).This review will be reviewing the actual gameplay and what you will be getting when you buy this game if it works.No Man-'s Sky is a pretty controversial game gameplay wise, mainly because it fits a niche group of players (which I would consider myself among that group). On one end of the spectrum you see people saying the game gets boring after two hours, and on the other you see people praising it for it-'s endless entertainment, why is that?Well the fun from NMS comes from the exploration more than the gameplay itself. If your looking for strategic and engaging combat this game isn-'t for you, on foot the combat is more of a level test than actual combat, Space combat on the other hand is a bit different, it sometimes it feels like a dog fight, others it feels like seal clubbing. Also this might just be me used to the Elite Dangerous piloting controls but I feel like the lack of vertical thrusters contributes to the lack of depth in space combat.Exploration and adventure is were this game truly shines. Structures and interesting becons to explore are rather dense on the planets which gives plenty to explore, not only that but there are randomly generated caves you can find on some planets which are rich with resources and materials. Each planet is unique in it-'s own way either with different colour grass, sky, water, different creatures and unique terrain generation.Now everything you just read probably makes the game sound pretty bad, but I-'m having a absolute blast playing this game currently, finding a planet that no-one else has ever come across, naming the flora and fauna and claming the planet as my own feels great. I feel like future columbus except I only come across Phallic looking creatures and name them some variation of Bigdik because I-'m a mature adult.All that being said I honestly don-'t think I can reccommend this game, I-'ve heard the phrase -Vast as an ocean, shallow as a puddle- applied here but that does not feel right to me. That still being said I dont think there is enough exploration content to justify the 60$ price tag. This should have never been released as a AAA game, I wish they went the Elite: Dangerous route and slowly update the game as they go on, or add official modding support so people can do it themselves.
Looks like it was made by disney10/10
Better graphics than COD:Ghosts
