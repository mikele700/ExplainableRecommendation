Terrible
Well this was a disappintment. This is Left4Dead in HL2. Slow zombies, terrible servers, awkward controls, glitchy interface et let it down. Overall, a miss!4/10
So, I am reviewing mods this whole week. Ive reviewed Estranged and No More Room In Hell yet and Half Life:Before. Now onto Synergy. You can play Synergy if  you have a game using the Source engine. So thats HL, CS etc. It is a Co-op FPS in well-designed levels. The shooting is great. However the main problem is replayability. After a round of having fun, I got bored with the same mechanics.If you want to have fun in this game, play it with friends using voice chat. Otherwise its a5/10Average
Great visual novel. Pros:- Great choices and consequences- Variety of situations- Brilliant writing, develops characters in a very short time to great effect- Some good roleplay optionsCons- Soundtrack can get tediousOverall, a great game that is definitely worth your time (very less time, that is).9/10
Best Game ever!
Crap game
AWESOME! THIS IS EPIC!
Another mod, another hit! At first I was not impressed, bad graphics, awkward gameplay and mechanics. But after that, I got right into it. You get to play as either the zombies or survivors.Game modes are creative and you get used to the mechanics,Its a fun game.6/10
