After the death of Zizzy Balooba, emperor of the planet Swizzle Firma, the aliens have kidnapped my recommendation of Bioware's MDK2 from my cerebral cortex and have held it ransom. As I cannot afford to pay the ransom, instead, have a recommendation of Level 5's Professor Layton and The Unwound Future.  This game has what you'd expect from a Professor Layton game; great story, great graphic and in general, great things that you expect in the series. It will grip you every time you solve a puzzle and the cutscenes are just magnificent. It has a long plot to keep you occupied every puzzle solved is another mystery unravelled. Though the series is exclusive to Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS, I still advise you to try this game if you have the neccessary consoles. It's a great game and after you try it, you won't regret it.  I LIKE PIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
