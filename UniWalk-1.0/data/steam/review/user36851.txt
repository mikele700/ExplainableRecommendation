Verdun is a tactical WW1 FPS with an emphasis on teamwork revolving around 4 man squads. The gameplay and visual style of the game is similiar to Red Orchestra 2--Rising Storm, although there are several unique elements involving trench based combat and some unorthodox class loadouts (get used to using handguns and revolvers, which are quite handy in some circumstances). Getting your head around these unique elements might take a few hours and you'll probably die a lot, much like the real inexperienced soldiers of WW1, but after gaining a bit of experience Verdun is a very exciting and rewarding gaming experience.Highly Recommended unless you suck at games
