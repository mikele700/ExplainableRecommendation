This is a really fun game if you enjoyed the other halos you will enjoy this one. Just a side note it is a top down twinstick shooter.
THIS GAME IS AWESOME i have been playing it for 3 hours now (according to steam but feels a lot longer than that) and it is really cool i made a bunch of games on it that recieved great reviews and made a bunch of engines in short it is a game u could spend hours on granted it doesn't have a lot of things on there but who cares its fun to play and u shoudl buy it especially since it is 10 dollars on steam
summary: free running, vibrant colours and an fps platformer
