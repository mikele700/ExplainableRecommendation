Well if you live in Australia than you would understand this. Our servers are plagued with foreigners with sky high ping and all they do is team up and kill everyone for no reason. Even if you just respawned. It mainly seems to be asians & Brazilians.Its not racist or anything its the truth. For some reason they all flock to our server not being able to understand a word of english and just kill everyone and horde all items. Single Handely why the game needs so many fixes and wipes. Because its filled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.So until they make it people exeeding a ping of 140 can't play on the server & ban all these exploiters and greivers.  I will never rate this game good.
This game is like CS Source but has terrible rego & the tick is Is for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Plus it has more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ than normal.
Great game got to produce weed, heroine, opium & cocaine. It made me wealthy which is great. All Tropico games are great.
Action, guns, robbing, shooting cops, making paper, what else can I say. If you're not convinced you're a alien.
Rome Total War 2 is a amazing Strategy game, it's fun to play with friends or even by yourself. You can conquer the world. The feel of this game is really good, I really get into it & the graphics and gameplay are all round great. I played without mods for ages and recently downloaded the Radious Total War Mod, I highly recommend it for people who want to add more to the game.
Its a cool zombie game that's different from L4D for a change.Similiar to a Zombie Panic feeling to it.You play with friends & you have missions & objectives to complete & survive.The maps are pretty good, the size & look is good & pretty explorable.
Great first person shooter survival game. Scary, blood, guts & a whole lot of fun.Teamwork based.
Brothers In Arms: Hell's Highway is in my opinion one of the best WWII games ever. Great story that gets you right into it & great gameplay.If you want a game with all that, this is the game for you.
