Just no. Unless you are willing to drop more bucks into DLC to enjoy this.
What does it end to;FirewatchFirewatch is a game with a cast so diverse and likable you want to hear more about them, and how they talk to each other with such electrifying(heh) dynamic. You get that in the early stages, with Henry and Delilah making rounds at each other, talking about their personal life, and just plain snark at each other. Its fun to see such a great performance by both voice actors talking to each other about a raccoon and solving crossword puzzles.Then we start to enter the middle stages, without spoiling it, there are plot lines that start to converge on Henry and Delilah. Its not new per say, but it-'s a very intriguing plot line nonetheless. You are hooked into it, I was.But then Firewatch throws it all away in the most softest sounding bang it could find. The end credits roll and you are left with a game so good, you wondered why did it end -like that-.The game finishes in 3 or 4 hours, depending on how much you want to take your time. Firewatch starts strong, but ends in a whimper. I don-'t recommend buying Firewatch unless its in a deep discount. Because in the end, you will like the game, but will leave you finishing it unsatisfied.
