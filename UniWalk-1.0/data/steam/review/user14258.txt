Hey all my friends and others, I don't recommand games too often but this is HIGHLY recommanded on my list if you love horde games (Also if you love L4D this is a must buy.) It's melee combat is awesome, loot drops, crafting system for different melee/range weapon to change up the horde system. I been playing the beta today and oh my god I sunk so many hours already. Anyways I give this game an 7/10 opitimzing need fixing (The dev said they will fix that when it releases so hopfully they go though with it.) But that all fokes, review will change when it out of beta depend for better or the worse. Loving this game!
