The Half Life series is one of the most famous games in the books. It was my first game I ever got on steam, All thanks to the orange box. I just wanted portal but I got much more! Just buy this game and the others and play, its fun, exciting and has a good stroy. 10/10
It's fun enjoyable game that pulls me back in for more every i die, Its got a great consept that you could get any item in the game! But usualy you would get a really Over Powered item at the begining.   8/10
Team Fortress 2 is a game loved by many, all ages seem to play it and enjoy it. I used to play it myself but i grew to like other games and didnt really play it as often. The game itself does have its ups and downs, Like the goodness when you earn an achive or get a new item. The 1 main thing i dont like about it is, that it updates nearly every week! And needs to do another take of my internet and eats it like a bear. And i dont get unlimated internet like most so its even harder! But its still an ok game. ( But i always do wonder why 18-25 year olds still play it, dont you have something a bit more important to do in your life at that age? )  5 and a half / 10
