the reason i don't like this games is.  1.When you first get the game and you write the wrong age in it dousn't let you retry it.
Can be fun but the times ive played it has about two bugs that don't work.
Great shooter game very fun to play and can be a bit hard
It is very fun to play and it is realistice in a way that when you were in the cowboy times all that sort of stuff happend.
Can be very boring i would not recomend it.
