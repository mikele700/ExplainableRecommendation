Very nice game, easy to learn but hard to master i can tell. I haven't played very long but i can see it has a huge potential. I just wish my computer wasn't forced to 15 FPS while playing. :(
Amazing strategy game. Combat works very well and surviving in the wild is hard, just as i imagine it would be in real life. Over a few playthroughs i have frozen to death, died of acute bleeding in the lungs, and of a traumatic brain injury. And if a game has realistic ways of dying then you know its a good strategy game.
