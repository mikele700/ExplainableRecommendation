Repetitive game, Full of DLC's full of power creepI can overlook these thing (hell i even got all DLC's day 1)due to the fact the game was fairly entertaining and the overwhelming community behind this gameThis died today (16/10/15) Overkill broke the Lua and mod overide support and even addedMICRO-TRANSACTIONS, Mirco-transactiuons that BOOST STATS ingame and need real $$$ to buy themGoodbye overshill i was fun while it lasted
