Fun and addictive is all i have to say. It's a fast pace First-Person-Shooter with multiple styles of play, Quake live has straight the get-go been a completly fun blast and the basic premis of the controls are if you play any other FPS your a pro. The most important thing for me is im a rocket jumping maniac in TF2 and where did rocket jumping start? Quake so that means that im a rocket jumping maniac in Quake live. literaly any one who picks this game up and practices offline for half an hour can play half decent. I RECOMEND THIS GAME FOR FPS LOVERS
It's a realy fantastic game with a wide variety of content. not only that it looks good, but it plays good.But i do have to critisize it a bit so yeh. the controls are are bit too sensitive and the AI is a bit dumb.But over all for a free game its probobaly the best of it's kind out there
