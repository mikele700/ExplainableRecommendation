This game was fun and all when I first started, I was also reaaally baad.But then, after a couple of days I started getting better.So good infact that a buch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ squeakers got so butthurt they reported me, ALL OF THEM.Now my account is -Globally Untrusted- and on cooldown.So if you-'re the really competitive type, do not get this game.You cannot be better than anyone.
I totally recommend this game! Although it's one of those games that are only fun with friends, it truly is awesome!10/10 Just be aware, if you do play alone make sure to wear cheap underpants.
