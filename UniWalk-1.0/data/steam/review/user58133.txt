I have played a decent amount to get the grasps of the game, and at last I can play a graphiaclly amazing looking game and it packs a huge challenge with it. There is a lot of strategy involved when you try and take down your next orc captain and often finds yourself in epic battles against dozens of orcs.
Look to be honest I haven't played to much of the game to confirm my point, but everything I have played has been a blast and I highly reccomend anyone who wants a cheap action game. The combat system may not be the best but heck you get to blow stuff up, isn't that all you need. Some story missions may be a liitle boring but there are some moments you go, okay that was pretty cool. An example of this is when using the OP as hell minigun to take down enemies and to destroy walls to get you and a partner out of the area. Just Cause contains a slightly hard to get driving system which can be frustrating in side missions as you can constantly find yourself flying into a wall or losing control and crashing into another car... or two, or sometimes three. However Just Cause 2 makes up for this with awesome air veichles for quick transportation around the vast endless seeming map. With a definitely affordable price so far I think Just Cause 2 is a must buy on the PC.
Great Game, and cannot wait for full official release. I recomend it if you are prepared for a lot of bugs and glitches, and the occasional restart and reboot of your computer. Graphics are okay, but it is an awesome game, and great value.
