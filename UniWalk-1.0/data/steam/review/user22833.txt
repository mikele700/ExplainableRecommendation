I wish Mocap Studio wasn't so much, basic enthusiasts can't do ♥♥♥♥ because of the price.
I don't know if you can call this a game in the usual sense, I mean yeah it has point and click core elements but they seem so unimportant in the entirety of the experience. It's like a pick and choose adventure where you get to influence the main characters personality actions and reactions. I love it, it keeps me engaged and I really care about the decisions I make whether they have actual affects on the narrative are are just an illusion of choice.No complaints about the length or the episodic release format of distribution.
Great game, good to play something other than FPS or RTS. The comic-like aesthetic is good but I think it takes away from the grim setting and dramtic performance in this game, though have photorealistic graphics would up development times and costs. Great story quite similar to Last Of Us in a few ways.The complaints about the level of influence your decisions have in the story are made by people expecting too much. This isn't developed by some AAA studio with a megabudget, the narrative follows the same pattern as the Mass Effect series, you end up in the same place with a slight variation in who you are, who is around you and what happen outside of the core story.The 400 Days DLC is quite a good filler between seasons 1 & 2.
My nomination for GOTY 2012 along with Max Payne 3. The characters are awesome, the story interesting and the combat and gameplay was amazing.
