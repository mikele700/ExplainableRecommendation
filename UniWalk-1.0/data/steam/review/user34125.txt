I love this game it's soo cool with the classes, guns, perks, vehicles, maps, jetpacks, deployables and explosives. Its call of duty/battle field with alien's and space jets. you can just run them over enemies with a bike or fly into them with a jet or just crush them with a giant 4-wheeler.Seriously !this game is hard to start with puny weapons, basic armours and deployables but after you get a few kills with the ways i just listed you will be upgrading constantly with each battle gaining you around $1000 and most upgrades costing $4500. This game is Insanely fun i've wasted hours on it getting revenge repairing / destroying generators and just mucking about. Its guns are a bit hard to get used to i wish that they had a little auto aim like it would put yor crosshair close to the enemy not on it but once you figure out its easier to use granade launchers and A.O.E i guese rocket launchers and stuff  you will be grinding away the compitition                                                                                                                  Yours truely                                                                                                                             satisfied player
