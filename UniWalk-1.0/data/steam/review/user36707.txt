People don-'t seem to realize that most of the weapons/heist/mask is a dlc only.On top of that IF you even open the safe, you need a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good rng cause ur either gonna get a weapon that you DON-'T have. The -Rebalance- update was to make sure their micro would stay alive, why? because all of those skin in the safe have a stats boost which going to be op, you think +1 damage is nothing but they changed the weapon stats too make sure you need to buy the skin (which involves HEAVY rng to get one) to hit damage breakpoint/concealment/etc. Almir said in his ama that the game REVOLVES around VANILLA CONTENT but MOST of the stuffs is UNLOCKED by DLC,not to mention that this game have TONS(120$+). We veteran players are trying to save you from doing a mistake like we did. Blindly purchase all of the stuff just to get ♥♥♥♥ed by OVERKILL. If you dont believe about the weapon rebalance update read it from here https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/3q8xpw/so_the_new_weapon_rebalance_is_balanced_around/-PS Sry for my bad englando
