An amazing game, for all those that enjoy 2D side scrolling games along with crafting and fighting monsters to survive, this game thrives to keep the player ocupied with learning how to craft certain items and abiltitys (like minecraft). Along with choosing your class by picking your abilitys like magic, melee and ranged attacks in which you get the new choice of an ability every 5 levels, I recomend this game to any one that loves minecraft, side scrolling games and challenging enemys which will put you to the limits!
