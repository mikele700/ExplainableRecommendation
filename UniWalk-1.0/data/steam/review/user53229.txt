I can't believe I didn't play this game until now. I could happily say that this game is one of the most beautiful, and enticing games that I have ever played. The visuals are beautiful as well as the story line which has the potential to pull you right in from the moment you start playing.
I have completely played through this game many times and each time I do I still find it to be the most beautiful, intriguing and well designed game. Gone Home is a short interactive story game with an absolutely beautiful story. If you like games with a great story and games that will keep you thinking for hours after you play this is a game you should buy.
Monaco is a brilliantly designed, fun and challenging game that is especially fun to play with friends.
