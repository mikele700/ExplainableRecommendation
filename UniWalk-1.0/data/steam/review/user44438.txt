<BEFORE REVIEW NOTICE> Played about 100-200 hours on the browser before the steam release and am only just now getting round to this review because i havent quite been bothered enough<BEGIN REVIEW :P> Positive: This game is great. If only i could end it like that but there is so much more to say. The game itself is like if insurgency and battlefield had a child which decided to become free. (No mum, this is my ART!). To begin with the community is great, at least in Australia/Oceania. I-'ve only encounted a few toxic squeakers and have made it my person mission to eliminate them repeatedly.The guns are really fluid and I like the semi-realistic take the developers have taken on. With most rifles and smg-'s requiring 2-3 bullets to kill.The maps are fun to play and encourage teamwork and make for some great moments with or without friends. New guns every month or so. Negative: Optional buy-in credits of some sort. Really quite optional, as mentioned before pretty much every gun does 2-3 bullet kills. (Snipers obviously less)Sometimes struggle to actually get into the game, keeps saying -installing plug-in, please wait- for about 10 minutes but as mentioned before, once you get into the game you can easily forgive it.Well thats pretty much it. Hope this helped you make a decision. In the end though, its free, its fun and a good time waster 5/7 would spend 20 minutes writing a review for again.
Very fun especially with friends. Can be a bit boring without. Other than that like minecraft but with tons of mods and round objects. Not that thats a bad thing of course. Space engineers is a minecraft-like building sim but in my opinion.  A hell of a lot more fun. Would recommend to all people who like space. (Tip: turn your mouse sensitivity all the way up when piloting ships)
Terrible. Dont buy. Bad Graphics, boring gameplay and uninteresting dialogue make this a terrible game.
Cheap and fun. A MUST buy for all!
♥♥♥♥ING EPIC
Really fun to play with friends
BEST GAME EVER
