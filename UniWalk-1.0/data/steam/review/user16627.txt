Love it, it's simple, addicting and a good time waster!
For me atleast this game feels like it would fit in better on mobile/webstore, there is also a few area's where you can glitch through boxes and just walk around the map,  it's a nice idea it really . but i just can't get into it.
Top game, love it. handled my portal fix for a while XD
It's an ok game, I probably wouldn't buy it stand alone, but with the Tripwire bundle it's a nice neat side dish.
Love it.
Fantastic  game
Good game, dev messes around with stuff alot but on the whole fun to play and going in the right direction.
