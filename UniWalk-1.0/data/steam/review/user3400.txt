Fantastic game.Pros:Good multiplayer features including local multiplayer for Career mode.Split screen multiplayer not just locally but online with friends as well.Great controls very much like Mario Kart, or even better.Neat selection of characters.Cons:I feel Expert difficulty can be quite a pain for certain game modes.
