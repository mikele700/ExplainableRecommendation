Awsome, this game isnt pay to win and you get SP easily which is the currency EARN to by weapons. The game also has a funny MOBA mission mode which i hant seen before. Problem is the servers are only in America (i assume) i am an aussie gamer and i have lag, nothing unlivable with and extreme i just feel like im being shot through walls. besides that it is awsome, the TDM maps are also lame but the otheres are great
OMG SO GOOD! you know that feeling when you set your first orphanage on fire? its like that all over again!
These turtles are scary af
-Son you can be anything you want to be when your grown up.- Son replies -I wanna be call of duty!-
i dont have the game but i can post a review :D, theres guns
most innovative game ive played in yearsStill pretty pricy though, add a level editor n modding support,aye it will even fit the games theme
