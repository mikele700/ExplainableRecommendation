Hello, this is my manditory positive review. By orders from my superiors I must tell you that this is one of the greatest Russian Life simulator around. Go to your shed, deny strange people into your country and then go home to eat turnips with your wife. This positive review is over, you are inclinded to buy this game. Glory to Arstotzka
One of the best games i've ever played
