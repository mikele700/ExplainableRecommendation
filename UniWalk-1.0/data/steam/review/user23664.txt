This game is, as Sonic's announcer would say. GOOD, GREAT!, OUTSTANDING!, AMAZING!.Now onto why.This game is exactly like most other games such as tf2, and other similar games you probably get the jist. The main idea of this game is that you can build ANYTHING! I have seen people roll around in PixelArt doges, or Pepes. Sure everything is stuck behind leveling up, but after you play for a bit the level ups start rolling in, and suddenly you can fly, shoot missiles or warp ahead. I CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME ENOUGH!
