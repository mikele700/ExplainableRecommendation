Best part of this game is yelling at complete strangers.

It's got Simon Amstell, that bloke that made that other bloke walk out on that episode of Nevermind the Buzzocks.You can stand on a table... and there's a tiger.
Can't close my eyes without this game running through my head.
An amazing game to play with friends, everytime I play I'm in tears laughing at idiotic things that happen. The only downside is a bit of lag while changing turns.
Great casual Indie game. Try to beat the game to unlock items and advance to further bosses. By playing and completing set goals, unlock more items to help fight all the baddies.
