I've been playing Dirt Rally with a controller and I feel that the game handles very well, but get ready to crash over and over again, but the reward of finishing a race clean makes it worth it, you might race on the same track 10 times and each time it's different, but i do feel that the rwd cars need a bit more work on the handling, all up this is a very balanced game for a early access, I would recommend to buy it but be warned, the tracks are not forgiving and there will be a lot of rage quits, but if you are ready to put in the time and effort into it, out of all the racing games I've ever played this would be the most Adrenalin inducing one out there, I play on ultra but I've played on all graphical settings and all are wonderful. But if you have a wheel I recommend using it because it will help, I used a mates the other day and the game feels a lot more natural and smooth.
