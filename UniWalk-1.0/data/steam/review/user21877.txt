Excellent game if you can run it at 30fps.
Excellent game with great, comic style, graphics. The stroryline is epic however it is strongly recommended to play the first Borderlands before you play this one. Playing with FXAA is almost essential. Although the game is a bit old now, it still plays stunningly. Definitely reccomended!
