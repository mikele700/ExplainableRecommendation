Got this game when it was on sale for $25, it was definitely worth the money. I would have gladly paid over $80 for this game. Its got great gameplay runs smoothly and lets not forget, it looks fantastic! You you don't even need great hardware to run this game on medium settings. I fully recommend this game to anyone.
