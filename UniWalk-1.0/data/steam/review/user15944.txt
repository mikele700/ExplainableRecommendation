I was paddleing through the thick fog and pouring rain, in the distance i see the silhouette of a large island and a few ship wrecks. i thought i was really lucky because i had been paddeling for about 20 minutes, i get closer to the island and i see crabs and palm trees as far as the view distance would allow. As i was about to get off my life raft a tiger shark rams me and knocks me and my precious coconuts into the water..... as you can tell the shark and I did not share coconuts while sitting in hammocks in the sunshine.. he tore me limb from limb until the pacific was red with my blood. but seriously this game is fun already even though i suck and keep dying. 10/10 to me :D
