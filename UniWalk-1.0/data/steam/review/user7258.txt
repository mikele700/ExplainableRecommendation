This game is an amazing, well crafted piece of work and should be in every one's steam library
DAMN THIS GAME IS GOOD, theres so much fun and rage here that you couldn't possibly refuse...just make sure your playing with a friend though so you can get the best experience.
Although I can't say that i'm the most avid player of this game (i know people who achieved over 1000 hours) its still quite fun with a lot of potential left in store for thisalthough there is one thing I can say for sure....THIS IS WAY BETTER THAN DESTINY AND ITS FREE
Its a game about driving trucks...how could you ever refuse.
I was surprised by this game to say the least as I just couldn't get into it regardless of how much i wanted to play something bioshock related...maybe its because your a big daddy but i can see where people will like it but i'm just gonna have to stay away until I feel like giving it a shot again.
This game has such a great atmosphere with an engaging story and great music that its hard to believe that some people haven't played it yetif your looking for a FPS with a great story then you have to play this (after you play the originals of course)
this is love this is life
