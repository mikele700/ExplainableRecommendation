Dota 2 is a fun, rage-inducing game that requires imo around 50 hrs to grasp the idea and mechanics of the game. With over 100 characters to learn, master and build to the situation. The game offers endless possibilities with a skill bracket ranging from complete and utter n00bs to that of professional players. Beware though, you can be sucked into the game and possibly ruin your life XD.
