This has got to be my favourite indie roque type game. It is so much fun. Definitely a must have, and also, BUY THE DLC!

To be honest, Arkham Knight is not as bad as people said it was. Yes the port is terrible, but its story is still quite good. The only problem I have is the batmobile. Why do you, Rocksteady, think it is ok for half of the game to be based in a need for speed with guns chase? It doesn-'t make sense. Just make it how it was in Arkham City, that was a better version of this game. Overall, Rocksteady, next time have your original team working on the port and don-'t make half the game a car game with -friendly- as they call it, guns.6.5/10 - Buy it for a cheap prices if you want the game. The port is better, but it still is a car game.
The best Batman Game ever made. Fantastic AI, an amazing plot and great voice acting.
Buy this game, its worth it. Do it for Jorjii.GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA!Signed: Jorjii Costava 11/10
South Park: The Stick of Truth is a wonderfully crafted humourous RPG. Worth buying if you love South Park and crude humour. Just buy it, no asking. (Don't get the DLC.)11/10 Would buy again.
Clicker Heroes is one of those games where you think its childish and will suck, but that is not the case. As soon as I played it, I sunk 2 hours into this game. It has very simple controls and is very addictive. The graphics are actually quite good. Overall, if you want to just click, click and click, get this game as it is for free!Though it is simple, it will get you addicted like Crack, its just an easy solution.7/5/10- Jarps
