Absolutely fantastic game. I could not stop playing and have played several hours of it within a couple of days. I love the crazy plot and the sidemissions are great fun as well as the story. This game is hilarious and I was laughing the whole way through. It is absolutely crazy with scenes ranging from Princess Kenny drinking green goo that turns her into a Nazi zombie to disguising as a doctor and giving Randy Marsh an abortion. I would recommend this game to everyone.The only thing that I didn't like when I was playing this game was when it ended. I enjoyed it so much and I wanted it to never end. I wish the game was longer. Overall, South Park: The Stick of Truth would have to be one of my favourite games. I was glued to my screen while I was playing it and I would definitely play it again and again. If you love South Park, get this game now. It does not disappoint.
