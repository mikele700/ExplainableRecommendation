My world, was a dark void. I had nothing, knew nothing. I felt my will slip away, each and every day. What was life? What.. what was I here for. Questions drifted through my empty head, persisting me with answers, answers I couldn-'t give. It was one night I almost took my life. Pills or, or, a gun to my head. But there was a shining light in my life. Something that I-'d almost overlooked ever since my world started to ruin. Something inside me made me stop. I dropped the gun, dropped the pills and ran from the kitchen. Through the living room, and past the hallway towards my room. I slowed to a stop as I reached my computer. I turned on the computer and logged on...I opened Skype to check if my best friend had replied and said he-'d talk to me again, let me have my girlfriend back, pay for my car that he broke and convince my parents to accept me again.My eyes glanced over the page hopefuly then drifted to the bottom. -You-'re a ♥♥♥♥wad who plays Warframe all day. Get a life.-I sat down on my chair and let out a sigh. I lost my job, my friends, my girlfriend, my parents, my life...The only thing I had left was Warframe.Then again, Warframe made me lose my job, my friends, my girlfriend, my parents AND my life.Eh.Warframe was the best game I ever played. Thank you <3
