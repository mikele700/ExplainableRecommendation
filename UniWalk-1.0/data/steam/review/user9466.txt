I have read atleast 30 reviews saying how the game is unfinished because of server issues, crashing issues and how the game is being released episodically. Number 1. The server crashing has been fixed and yet the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reviewers still leave their negative reviews up.Number 2.You need a good computer to run Hitman, i feel that is something people dont get so they just leave negative reviews. and finally number 3. how impatient do you have to be to release a negative review for a game just because its being releases overtime. the gameplay is great. its more open than Hitman Blood Money. the best hitman so far.
Developer was very helpful with fixing a problem i had with this game. He fixed it within 3 days. Enjoyable game and its  worth way more than the small price of 15 dollars.
fun as hell
