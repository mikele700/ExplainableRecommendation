Died of hunger after closing down game10/10 reminds me of the nintendogs i havent fed in 7 years
Played for 11 minutes. talked to random people. skipped all dialogue. didnt know the story. relised that this is pretty much a talking simulator rip off of pokemon and final fantasy. fought a rat. instant death from one critical hit. quit game. uninstalled. 10/10 would talk again.
