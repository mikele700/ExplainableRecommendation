A game that has the voice of Jack Black......YES please. An awesome game, gets a bit boring if you play it 8 hours straight. However its always seem to drag me back to it and play for another 8 hours. A legandary time waster if you like just wasting time. Oh did i mention that it HAS.... JACK BLACK in it......JACK BLACK!!!!! OH YEAH xD
A very good game, However not a very scary game (there might be parts that make you jump). I have to say the co-op is insane like its wicked sick ( in a good way). THe story is very good, kind of explains what happened in the past and also ends pretty well aswell. this game is good for those that want to finish the F.E.A.R trilogy and find out what happens next or just want a good co-op game. I would recommend it to anyone. If you are still dont trust me just wait for the special that steam has for it, its wroth the money then
THIS GAME IS JUST FREAKING.........AWESOME. yep thats it, that is all that needs to be said. A brillant game, Awesome graphics (at its time). Gameplay (oh man yes :D) and stroy are just soo wickedly ( not sure if it's a word if not it is now) Legen...DAIRY ( for those who love milk). it gives you choices on how to do the missions like stealthy or all 360 blazin'. This was the only reason i got steam for and probably one of the best games in my library ( even though i dont have too many). THis is a MUST HAVE......... A MUST HAVE. you arnt cool unless you have DEUS EX - HUMAN REVOLUTION.
An insane game, with very differnet graphics compared to Call of Duty and other !st person shooter that you would be use too. However dont let that stop you from playing it, packed with comedy and action. It the game that i would recommed to everyone
NOT EVEN WORTH BUYING, TOO MANY HACKERS...A money waster
