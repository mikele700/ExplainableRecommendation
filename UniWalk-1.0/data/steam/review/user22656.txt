I don't usually write reviews, but I just finished the game and gosh darn. If you're reading this and you don't mind a bit (maybe a lot, depends on you're fear tolarence) of nightmares: Buy this game. The game isn't just about gore and violence, there are alot of meanings behind it, worthy meanings of life and emotions and who we are and who we choose to be and how we face our fears. There are some pretty funny parts too so yah. So, the main goal of this review, as I sit here after just finishing the game at 5:21 in the morning with teary eyes, knowing that I should probably sleep instead of writing this probably unecessary review bc i have lectures tomorrow, I will just say; Buy it. Gosh darn buy it or so help me... I will buy it for you. Jks i have no money ._. but its worth the money so buy it you. And the score is amazing and the dialogue is amazing and the atmosphere created is amazing and the characters are amazing and the art style is amazing yas loved it.10/10 would beat a snail at tick tak toe again
