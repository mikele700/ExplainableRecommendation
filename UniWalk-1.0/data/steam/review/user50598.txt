This game is really great depending on what you enjoy. The game allows you to create a battle vehicle in your own image but holds its restrictions. It has a block/item cap which is good because people can build an insanley gigantic vehicle if they aren't a high enough level. The game offers many modes of transportation (hovering, driving, and flying) and all of which are very usfull. The tech tree includes some really cool items, such as a plasma canon or a railgun, but is fairly difficult to progress in. All in all this game is very enjoyable and I highly recomend it.
