Great game, wide variety of weapons, items, armour and enemies. I highly recomend this game. You can build, fight, collect, build and fight and do WHATEVER you want. Your first step in this game is to beat the Wall of Flesh and get into hardmode. Some might say that's the end, but it is only the start. MORE BOSSES, MORE WEAPONS, MORE ARMOUR, MORE ENEMENE... ENEMENEMEN... ENEMENEMENEMEN... ENEMENEMENEM... ENEMENEMENEMEN... you get the point right? JUST MORE OF EVERYTHING!!!!6/10 Needs more explosions. Joke. It is a decent game to play with friends or while bored.
AWESOME GAME!!! YOU HAVE TO GET IT!!!!!!!!!Seriously though, this game is AMAZING!!! You can play in survival or creative mode. Survival mode is where you gather your resources and build what you can afford to build. Creative mode is kind of like Minecraft in space, BUILD, BUILD, BUILD and BUILD!!! In this game, you can use your imagination to build whatever you please. You can build a giant Mario that can fly around and shoot rockets at asteroids. You can also steal random ships that appear and destroy them for blocks or use a solar station to produce energy (mainly survival). Also this game can be played either with Single-Player or Multi-Player. Just saying, but ANY GAME WITH MULTI-PLAYER IS BETTER!9/10 Just... Awesome.
This is an epic game of destruction and teamwork. It is very closely related to world of tanks and minecraft because of its ability to build your own robot fighter to destroy the enemies robots. I highly recommend it to anyone with the spare time to play it!9.5/10 Disconnects lots, but other than that... BEST FREE GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED (JUST better than Toribash).
This is a truly AMAZING game! You pilot your Kerbals into space with the spaceship YOU made!The main objective to the game is to successfully pilot your Kerbals into the Mun (Moon} and eventually any planet. This game does take some getting used to. It took me personally a couple hours with my friend on voice chat trying to explain to me how to do everything (TBH: I still am trying to get the hang of it), BUT after you figure out how to play, then it is INCREDIBLY FUN to play.WARNING: It is very normal to have your first HUNDRED attempts to fail and it takes EVEN LONGER to get to the Mun with proper landing and everything.7/10 It needs to have better tutorials explaining what to actually do.Played it since before steam and it has developed AWESOMELY!
