A suitably punishing roguelike platformer.  Winning feels good.  Progressive unlocks mean a good slog ending in failure doesn't feel like a waste.
-Run for fun? What the hell kind of fun is that?-
Elegant integration of gameplay, story, world development and aesthetic.
Random drops and random quests, with stat points.  Animation style reminiscent of the era before the Voodoo card.
Fun balance of tactics and strategy.  Potential for very rewarding battles on smaller maps.  Can become a bit of a grind on larger maps (>200 stars).
Fun world builder, with plenty of option of how you want challenge served to you.  Gnome pathing sometimes frustrating if you expand very very quickly.
