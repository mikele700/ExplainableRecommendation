Dragon Ball Xenoverse is probably the best instalment in the Dragon ball game series to date and after playing 45 Hours I'm not disappointed. Combat is basic but never gets old since you're constantly feel like a character in the manga/anime, pulling off crazy moves against crazy powerful foes. This is a fantastic game that I recommend playing if you're a dragon ball fan.
