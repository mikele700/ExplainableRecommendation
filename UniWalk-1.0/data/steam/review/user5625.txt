Micotransactions added to game means no chance of me ever getting back into it. Maybe if it was a F2P title i could understand...
Game is fun, a bit unbalanced with certain items and classes but fun none the less.There are a few issues with UI when you are running a non standard 16:9 resolution, other games such as LoL and even Smite have none of these issues.I have a 2560x1080 resolution and am forced to play in 1920x1080 as the UI takes up 1/2 the screen in 2560x1080, similar issues with 16:10 reported on forums over a year ago.
