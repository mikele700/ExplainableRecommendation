On the surface, it's easy to understand why so many people are ready to dismiss Starbound as nothing more than a Terraria clone in space. I was skeptical before I took the plunge for video and review work, and after a lengthy weekend session, I'm willing to claim that Starbound has so much more to offer.The basic quest system is great, giving you some guidance into the early crafting recipies and how to actually play the game. If you aren't into that, it's all good friends, You can just head off and explore the galaxy, alone or with friends.It's Early Access, so patches are coming hard and fast, and yes, you may lose your progress (it's happened twice for me thus far), however it's so exciting to be part of such a orust community. If you're looking for an adventure and you have some friends who are willing to play with you, go ahead and purchase the game right now!
This is a game with many layers, and while it will take most people a few sessions to learn the timing and basics required by each class, with each subsequent session you will learn the nuances that King Arthur's Gold has to offer. The constant push and pull between the two teams is unlike anything I've experienced in quite sometime, and then they myriad of awesome custom game modes out there (zombie survival anyone?) will keep you busy for months to come. Grab a pack with some mates and find a fun local server to hone your skills.STORM THE CASTLE!
