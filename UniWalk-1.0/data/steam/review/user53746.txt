HINT limit your carrying weight to bare minimum and make use of the sling shot early on!spawning in the southern 2 area and using up to 30 rocks with the sling shot while running backward(provided your light enough) on the CARBONEMYS will knock them out and they wont ever catch you while doing it and they r good body guards/take a beating. good vs TRIKES giving easy access to hyde early on. also have high torpor meaning plenty of time to forage for narco while waiting.hopefully that helps some people from dying a lot to a little, ive found it handy.This game will either become a classic and be in the gaming scene for years to come or influence a new generation of gaming.THIS is what sandboxing and crafting is about, well balanced and tweaking of settings is allowed? AWESOME and seemingly unheard of with games released lately.im 29 yrs old and have been playing games for 25yrs of my life on many many consoles but never been a computer person.Ive recently given up on consoles due to their lack of UI and mod support.this game has what ive been waiting for in games for awhile, although it may not have what everyone wants and it is limited to its style of game play the mod scene seems very active, the DEV's seem professional and busy and the community is awesome. the thing i like the most about this is the freedom to change almost all aspects of the games playability and keeping it fair to all players, 
could have mentioned the lack of gameplay in the demonot everyone has access to unmetered unlimited downloadi would have left this in the wishlist and not wasted precious(literally) download data on thisone suggestion if i may.i noticed when u hold both mouse buttons down u can do a neat 180/360 and what reminds me of a quick-dash in the cardinal directions. would be nice if u made it so u can hold those two buttons down and go into a free flight putting all flight controls and movement into the mouse.my personal opinion anyway
