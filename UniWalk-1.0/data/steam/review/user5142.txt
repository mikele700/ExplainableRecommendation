Great game, lots of fun and even better when playing with friends + mods
This game is amazing. Simply 10/10 !!
Payday 2, where to start?Well first of all this game is a complete time killer. Personally I can sit here for hours on end robbing banks and going full blown stealth mode in art gallery. This game continues to excite me due to the fact that this game is part skill part teamwork as soloing a heist take skill, that is not the point of the game. Teamwork takes a massive role whilst playing this game espically on Death Wish difficulty missions. I find this game quite entertaining, as upgrading my weapons, skills and perks make my character quite a proffensional :) Overall this game is fun to play with friends and random's, but still continues entertain me :)
Wow! So much to say about this game! It is one of the most fast paced game I have played in a while. The game has so many funny moments in it which can be enjoyed by friends and even randoms! Overall I rate this game a 10/10 :D
This game is amazing to play with friends and can keep your attention for quick a long time. This is one of my favourite FPS games (First Person Shooter) and I highly recommend this game to anyone who taked intrest in FPS and cartoonie characters.If you do, this is the game for you.
