For a group of 4 people, this game is incredibly amazing. I love the idea of the cannibals and all the really cool features like spear fishing, cutting down trees and the little secrets that lay all around the map. 10/10
Tf2 is a good game in my opinion, still trying to get the hang of it and figuring some stuff out about it though its still s good game and definatly recommended
