Fan-bloody-tastic game it's so realistic and good to see a WWII game like this
Great game it's great to be el presidente. This game is a great dictator simulation if you like. very fun you can do so many more things than regular city builder games I love it absoloutely great!!!8/10
This game is amazing I really enjoy the partial open world. Also the bullet ballistics I find are a lot better then Sniper Elite V2. Another great feature of this game is the new X-ray shots as they now incorporate muscles, circulatory system and new BALL PHYSICS! and the graphics on the x-ray shots are just sooooo much better. In a way there is more to choose from when you shoot someone. They also have added X-ray shots on vehicles so thats really awesome exploding vehicles. There is now new weapon customization and new weapons like the Italian Carcano rifle and the German panzershreck. And new enemies not Germans and Russians but now again Germans and Italians, in a way i liek that as the Italians aren't really recognised much in WWII. But this game is just legendary I definately recommend this game especially with the Hunt the Grey Wolf DLC it's really good. I give this game a rating of 8/10 
Great game especially since there is a mixture between old and new. Because you have old samurai and archers against new line infantry with rifles. Great contrast very realistic i highly recommend this game especially since you can go into first person view.
Fun thats all i have to say
Really really fun especially how most things are destructable and driviable. I really enjoy the freedom of it although at times it can be a bit repedative.
Great game i love all the choices and so historically acccurate love it
