dont get this game servers are ♥♥♥♥ gameplay is boring and repetitive and their is a lot of people who are just so blatantly bs that they are hacking and even some people admit it. if u live in australia or somewhere like that u will always have about 250 ping as all the servers i connect to are american or european servers and it takes about 5 mins to find a game normally. My avg ping for other games is 15-30 so its not my end.
AMazing game 9/10 definetlythere is some bugs but it is definetly worth it The fact that I cant lobby with friends does kinda ♥♥♥♥ me off since i bought 2 friends the game, developers if u read this plz implement that u can 4 man lobby only as surviors just so u can play with friends it isnt game breaking for randoms if u are only 4 survivors and this would extend your game life a ♥♥♥♥ load
game has huge memory leaks runs on 10-15 frames for me its not my comp my comp runs gta 5 fine but this game has so many bugs and random crashes huge waste of money especially if u cant play it cause it crashes or memory leaks or something
As soon as this game goes on sale do not get it or play it all u do in comp is vs hackers or smurf accounts that people just troll on and its really boring and makes me really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because i play to have fun but i want to rank up and it just means i derank and i quit this game a while ago and came back today straight away vs a rage hack squad who admitted it they got reported but valve makes people that are reported go to overwatch which doesnt do much cause most people dont get overwatched.
this is an awesome game get it if u want a great fps game
this game is fun but it only has servers in 3 countries North america Europe and the third one is Turkey. You should get this game but i dont know if they will bring out servers for countries like Australia and that plz do bring out a server for Australia so i can play easier. this game is great fun and yeah some of it is pay to win but there is also that great felling when you win without paying u dont need to pay anything to make it fun versus is great fun and co-op is brilliant
