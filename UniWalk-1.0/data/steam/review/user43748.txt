Love it! great mechanics and gameplay. One of my favorite indie games of all time. There are bugs (Duh its an alpha) you have to come into this expecting this, But this game is WAYYYYYY more than playable and the bugs arent even game breaking (most of the time) totally worth 30 $! 5/5 Brilliant!
A great game. A great soundtrack and already a very very polished game for being in beta. Love the exploration in this game 8/10 An instant buy
Do you like blowing sh*t up then this is the game for you. 11/10
Really good game! Really hard to learn the controls. Dont expect to save any lives in your first attemps. No doubt worth a buy!
Worth getting if its on sale. Its amazing how in depth this game is. Its extremly confusing at first but once you work it out its one awsome game.
Cool little Indie game. Quite buggy and some of the games mechanics are a bit messy, But has good potential.
Fricken Hard as game. Only buy it if your prepared for your butt to be kicked to the moon
