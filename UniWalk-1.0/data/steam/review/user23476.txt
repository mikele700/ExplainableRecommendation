 Great Game Read Review-t##Full game of $10.50 dollars or $15 USD is not worth it####Game is abandoned (No more updates##Now that all the disclamers are out the way I can get going onto the better parts of this game, the game itself is a type of sandbox survival underwater where you crash your submurine and have to survive underwater (Good if you like Minecraft, Survival Games Ect...) It's quite catchy as you can build whatever you want and there is so much to explore! Although WARNING ---> If you get boared quick don't buy this gameAlthough for your own sake don't buy this game for anything more that $5 because it's really not worth it if it is anymore than that! I've bought the game at $2 as there was a week long sale. so ONLY BUY IT AT ANY PRICE LOWER THAN $5
REALLy I BOUGHT IT FOR 15$ AND NOW ITS SELLING FOR $3!
Best game of the year i congratulate u and i have spent more than >> $30 << on this gameI really think this game is worth trying and with more than 100 hats and killstreaks and MVM stuff iv been soo greedy really i just want to collect them all!
