I cannot recommend this game. I wanted to like it but I can't. I am seeking a refund.- fell through the world- terrible user interface (holding a button down for two seconds to do anything in the UI)- UI clips outside of camera when zooming- basic controls not explained without checking controls list (like landing your ship)- close texture popin (sometimes making mined resources appear respawned)- useless animations for some events- no way to disable waypoints you have lost interest in, meaning they still show on your hud even if you are on a different planet- misleading claims about player interaction- misleading claims about larger events occuring- poorly optimised- revisiting prior planets resets progressAAA price charged for a slipshod buggy product that barely works. Avoid
For a game that is still nominally in beta, I have had ridiculous amounts of fun in Warframe.Squad-based 4-player mission instances across many amazing tilesets, with an incredible range of weapons and frames (exoskeletons) to use. Multiple mission types, looting, crafting, mastery ranks, Clan spacestations, Clan conflicts, events, and more.The dev team is highly connected to the playerbase in a way I haven't seen in other games. Updates are normally weekly, hotfixes are rapid when there's an issue, and let's not forget the devstreams.Who doesn't want to be a space ninja? Whether you are bending the forces of magnetism, setting the world on fire or teleporting to every enemy in the room and backstabbing them all at once, I hope you enjoy your new addiction.

Killing Floor has been my go-to team survival game for years. Aside from having regular events and crazy amounts of achievements to unlock, there's a quirky rawness to the game that appeals.If you like surviving waves of harder and harder enemies through skill and teamwork then give this a shot - you won't be disappointed.
