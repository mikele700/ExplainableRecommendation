Game plays itself.Spends more time looking at menu and a so called online leaderboard then actual game.Controls are super simplistic that even the term -Casual- doesn-'t discribe it.Game plays itself. Yes it has to be said twice as it really does. You can start a so called battle and walk away and it finishes it by itself.The -'Simulation-' part of it is basicly no existant.Just underwelming in all senses of gameplay and price.
Untill they fix whatever bug is causing the game to crash on loadup, don't even bother....EDIT:: The problem is avoided by running the program as administrator and a few other fixes. Though it may not be worth getting if your not willing to fiddle the game does have some pros and cons about it..Mostly though, in getting it to run, its around maybe 67% or a 74% of a rating...
