Follow the footsteps of Niko Belic in Liberty city, where you should see sex, drugs, crime and lots of violence. If you like a good story or 3 (Ballad of gay tony and The lost and damned) play this game, even though most prefer to kill innocents in free roam or people in multiplayer. In all honesty, the game is a blank canvas ready to explode with colour, but instead of colour it's mods.
