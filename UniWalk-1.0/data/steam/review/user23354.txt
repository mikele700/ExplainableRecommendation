7 Hours into this game and i am really enjoying it. Can't wait to get assult cannon.
A very clever little gem 10/10 whould sort of play again.
I am sorry Dota, But LEAGUE OF LEGENDS IS BETTER
Lots of fun and hard as hell.
Not quite as good as the first, but still fun(also no tau :( )
Got get mass effect and look at the strange thing called ''story''BUT it is a nice game, just not my cup of tea
This game is awesome you have to play it.
