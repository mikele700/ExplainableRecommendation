Great game and is definatlely worth playing but be careful you might get addicted other than this, it is an amazing first person shooter where you can pick 1 of 9 classes all with different ways of playing and different strategies, the community is also great, you can trade and work your way up with items and a lot of other interesting things too my favorite thing to do is play saxton hale servers or prop hunt both of which are very carefully planned and thought out wellwell done to the steam develpoers10/10
AMAZING GAME not to difficult and not to hard i really liked it and would recommend to anyone whoo likes adventur and fun!a great time waster i loved the hunting parts they were my favourite ENJOY IT
