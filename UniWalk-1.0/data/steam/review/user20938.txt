So after trying for aboult half an hour to change my video settings with the game crashing everytime I changed a single setting, I finally managed to play the game. It was fun.... foooor the first 80 minutes before it crashed for NO ♥♥♥♥ING REASON then crashes everytime I LAUNCH THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.The game itself is great but really GET YOUR ♥♥♥♥ TOGETHER UBISOFT. The WORST company to ever make games, especially towards PC community ._.
Saddest game ever ;c
