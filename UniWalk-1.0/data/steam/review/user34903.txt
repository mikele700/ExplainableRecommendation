So I live in Australia, Im in a different time zone compared to the majority of people that play this game so I-'m usally lucky if I find even 1 game that has enough players to start. But then when we get to playing my ping is around 400-700, so my experiance isn-'t as great as it could-'ve been. But still this game is quite fun. It-'s not really that scary allowing it to be more enjoyable than well, lets just say u wont be goin -ohhh its 3 spoopy 5 meh!!!11!!- Its a great game to play over a group skype call, or somthing along those lines.Now the REALLY BIG CON is the games lack of players (atleast in my region) as I stated earlier most players are in a different timezone, meanung i have to up rlly late at night or rlly early in the morn to find a ton of servers. Oh and its price, I feel like at $15 there should be a tad more.But overall if you have lots of friends and arent living In any other country but the US u should get this game.This was a rlly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reveiw ._.
This is fun 9/10
