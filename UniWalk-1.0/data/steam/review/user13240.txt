Even though the Axis boys lost World War Two therefore reducing the capabilities to produce high end products such as better tanks and planes, it kinda bugs me how broken the BR rating is. As a German tanker I'm alright fighting Is-2's, Pershings and all the tanks made from 1945 and below but fighting tanks from the future is kinda crazy, how can my super thick Maus compete with tanks that can penetrate its amour anyway.(and yes i know that Germans tanks are for long ranged combat but if everyone in our team keeps going long range who's going to rush?)I would play this game again if they would at least fix the BR
This game is a real treat if you want to try something new from a normal FPS let me explain[This is a bad review but...]Team Fortress 2, the name is what it means, unlike most FPS's Team Fortress forces you to work as a team (most of time) there are 9 different classes all with different abilities that can change the ride of war, for an example the scout, from his name you can run fast picking off weak enemies, and there is the heavy, a big buff Russian who can mow down anyone with his mini-gun but in return he is extremely slow.The gameplay is quite causal if you are in to that type, but you can also play competitive which you and your friends can fight other teams in your skill level.Also TF2 can also provide other entertainment like … hats.Ah, hats the soul of the valve economy, in this game you can change your characters appearance to your own liking you can also change you weapons as well depending in you like to play, an example for the spy, if you use a spy-cicle the bonus of using it is that you backstabs will be silent and if you get hit by fire you will be fire proof for 2 seconds if you come in contact with fire, but the downside is  that your enemies will turn to giant ice sculptures and when you come to contact with fire you have to wait for it to ‘respawn’ for 15 seconds.Either from all that random explanation of the game you should really try it; it’s the heart of steam and I will guarantee you’ll enjoy it, even by a bitBut for the final score10 out 10 I no longer no what outdoor's mean
I have recieved a skeleTON of feels playing this game
