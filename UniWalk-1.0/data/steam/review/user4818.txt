fun game and you can make your own map and download other people map for free co-op is great and the campan taken me 8 hours to finshed.
This game has a mind off it own. Fram rate drop so much since launch Evan having a high end PC. When having anti virus protection ( I used AVG but now different one) the game love to lock up your pc. If have a anti virus program installed the game crash on boot up or in a middle of a zombie game. The game alright but if you want to play a good cod game play WAW or black ops 1 or black ops 2. I would recommend this game if you like zombie or campaign. But the multiplayer still need a fix spawn feel like black ops 2. And pay to get cool stuff in the black market. If you don't mind the spawn and the over powers VMP pick up this game. This is one of the good cod game in the pass 2 year. If you have a friend over and want to play coop cod this game the only cod that you can play split screen on the pc witch I like
it better then the mod for ARMA 2
