My TF2 Experience in a Nutshell:Jumps across the map using sticky bombsGets a kill with a hamshankGets covered in urineHead get's decapitated by a golf club.11/10 would be covered in urine again.
I highly reccomend this to anyone who wants to have a good ol-' fantasy adventure, mods allow the player to customize their game to what they want.And remember the saying: 'mod it till it doesn-'t run!-
