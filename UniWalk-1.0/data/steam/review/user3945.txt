Feel like a finished Isometric version of DayZ SA.Has RPG/Crafting/Farming and Multiplayer.Easy to play offline/singleplayer.Lacks Ladders and Rifles.
Rather Fun HL2 Mod, reminds me a lot of a similar mod called The Specialists. Non stop deathmatch bullet time dive shooting carnage. I put up a dedicated local server for a few weeks or more if needed for anyone AU/NZ or OCE.
I can't recommend this game at all, it's terrible and full of bugs, it's a copy of warz and it's a bad one at that.Seriously though, only get this if you enjoyed the mod and can handle various random bugs/restarts/wipes, and want to support this game, if that doesn't bother you then get onto it as the initial release feels so much better than the mod (vanilla) and it looks like it's set to only get better.Plenty of Aussie servers too.
Early dev so content is being added, but stable to play and a pretty darn fun zombie survival. Setup houses and bases, craft ♥♥♥♥, kill people, help people.EDIT: Figured I'd update this to not recommended, these early access games are not for the weak gamer.
