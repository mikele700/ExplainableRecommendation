dont get this game, it is basically spartan assault with no differences, sure there might be a few different vehicles and enemies, but it's really not worth the price, so if ur a hardcore halo fan and want this game, wait until it goes on special or something
♥♥♥♥ U VALVE, FIX THE GAME U GOLD DIGGERSI still love the game, but if nothing changes and you just release sound changes and patch nothing and fix nothing, then im done
If you like South Park, you will love this game
10/10, need I say more?
Lame, don't know why i spent 30+ hrs on this bull sh*t
a lot like league of legends, but wif some differences, i would probably like it BUT i like league better so meh, pretty good but hate the DLCs they giv u automatically, cuz dont hav too much space on my pc ad internets hella slow, but otherwise pretty good
BEAUTIFUL FREAKIN BEAUTIFUL
da best free first person shooter game on steam, absolutely beautiful. the only con is that u have to pay for the weapons, clothes and other stuff that's in the game or wait for a long time to get the good ones:(. but otherwise it's really good.:D
