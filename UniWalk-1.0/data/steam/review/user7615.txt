After the many patches and optimizations that have occurred to the PC port, many issues that surrounded the game have been fixed.The Game is by far the best Call of Duty since MW2, and potentially the best in the entire series.There are few issues that I have encountered whi;st playing the game:In Campaign, dropped objects on certain levels will appear to float.In Multiplayer, after -Checking Quality of Matches- occurs, the client stops attempting to join games when 50 games are available.In Zombies, occasional graphic glitches occurred around Perk Machines and Power Panels.I have a GeForce GTX 750 Ti 2GB GPU that runs the game on Max settings and 100% Resolution (1600x900).10/10Genre Defining.21/8Zombies Defining.100/10Acid Trip Storyline was a bad trip holy ♥♥♥♥ I felt high for the first time in my life play the campaign -Its Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood.- - JonTron.
