I don't own this game yet, I played it, once, while it was 'free' for the weekend, I did some of the VR Training Courses, I ended up completing them all, even though I hated the ones in the end. (Helicopter training) I hate all the flying in ArmA, but the game is just great.
Really really bad mod, lags a lot, movement is fast at the start, but then, when you get inside, it's slow and laggy, and the ending boss? Oh, you know, I lost my weapons, and when I try to go into the box filled with weapons, I'm already dead, I can't kill the boss, No one should get this mod, it's the worst mod I have ever seen and played
This is awesome
