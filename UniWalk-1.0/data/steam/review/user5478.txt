This game is great fun, very reminiscent of the LEGO adventure games, the soundtrack is great to listen to also!I haven't played much of the game yet but initial impressions tell me it is a game I will enjoy finishing.I can tell the game will be quite easy as it is obviously designed for a younger audience but I believe adults will enjoy the experience just as much.Only problems I have encountered so far are:- Resolution in the game settings is set to 1080p although the game looks subsampled to 720p (I am not sure but I think this is what is happening, possibly a dodgy PC port?)- Cannot stream to a local steam client using the built in feature, the game will flat out crash every time.- I wish it had steam achievements.In conclusion, I rate this game a 7.5/10, pick it up and give it a go! (Definitely pick it up if you have kids that will play it!)
This game is amazing, it is sad that so little of these types of games still exist.While playing through The Last Tinker I kept getting memories of Ratchet & Clank and Banjo Kazooie, 2 of my all time favourite games.I'm actually very surprised that this game is an indie game, it is so well executed and the art style is amazing!The music is beautiful, I especially loved the music in the blue district and in the caves.The only downside is the difficulty, I defeated the last boss without losing any health.All in all, this game is great and I definintely suggest you buy it.9.5/10
Pros:+Looks very nice on max graphics, best looking drone sim so far.+Easy to set up with Taranis X9D Tx.+Controls are tight and responsive, and easily customisable.+Fair price point, comes in at half the price of Liftoff ($19.99) and double FPV Freerider ($5).Cons (I understand most of these are because of early access):-Only has a single level at the moment, would love to see more in the future.-No drone customisation (parts, design etc.) besides LED colour. Would also like to see some customisation similar to Liftoff.-I cannot run the game in fullscreen mode, I can only play windowed mode (I have multiple monitors, I think it's messing with the game a little).Suggestions:-I would love to see a free flight mode with an optional god mode to muck around in and not worry about crashing and resetting.-Player made content would be awesome, especially through steam workshop. Players could submit drone part assets, levels, you name it for anyone to use.-A campaign mode, no drone sims as far as I know include a campaign mode. I think the devs could take advantage of this and really set this game apart from the other sims.I can't review multiplayer aspects yet as I have not tried them, feel free to add me if you want to try some multiplayer in the future and I can revisit this review.Overall, it is a great simulator, definitely pick it up and practice with it - it might save you a few real life crashes and save you more than the game cost itself.Looking forward to updates from the developers!
Finished the game without getting a single achievement.Swell/10.
I only recommend this game if you get it for less than $1. I'd be very unhappy if I paid full price for this game.Quite repetitive, you'll pretty much play through every map a few times in a few hours and get bored.
