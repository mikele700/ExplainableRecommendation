This is approved by Plague Inc and we all approve of this for the damn, more close in details of the plague,towns,statistic,multiplayers,several new game modes and slightly more flat beautiful global maps with animated winds/clouds and aeroplanes plus ships in 3D shapes especially the global map which isn't exactly 3D.. At least not yet anyway.And I hope that they put in or make videos that show off the catastophic plague or the townspeople rioting/panicking/business as usual, as well as the news and natural disasters. That could be bloody enjoyable for sadistic people who likes to see people suffering in this game or people who just wants to know what is the people doing in their life. But hey its Alpha don't trust what I say in this okay?Oh what? A brony picture? Huzzah! I just ruin the anti-bronies day!....(No seriously thats enough, MLP already season 4 just give up)
This game is great! But, if your PC spec is in the minimum requirements, expect a lot of impatient high-spec PC people quitting after like 15 seconds into the loading screen. Happens to me often, a lot of you might have a gaming PC that meet the recommend specs, but show some mercy to those who are playing with the minimum specs. Seriously 15 seconds? Can't you wait for like a minute?
