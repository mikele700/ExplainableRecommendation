-This game remind me of my ex-girlfriend !- -0/10 I cried*
Didnt even make sense , except the store you are robbing is fill with peoples , the rest of the map is empty .10/10 !
Yes , yes this game may be boring and hard when u just started to play this game for the first time , but after some time , u will change ur mind and enjoy the gameplay especially when u kill an enemy with ur tripwire trap or land mine . I highly recommended this game to all steam user , give this game a try , its amazing ! 10 out of 10 ! Inferno map is the map I enjoy the most , try this out :D !
This game is awesome and its gameplay is pretty balance . Plus , this game is greatly optimized , i can play on ultra setting with 30+ fps , great job :D 9/10 !
180 well spent on this awesome game , I met alot of good players in this game :D !!! Unlike any other modern fps , this game really focus on teamwork , sometime you can twist a losing badly match ( eg. 3-13 )  to a winning game , its because of the spirit of teamwork ! No regret any penny that I spent on this game ! GOOD JOB Valve , you win our gamer's heart !
