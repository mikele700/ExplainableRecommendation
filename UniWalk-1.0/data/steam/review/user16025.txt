I love the series alot. I was confused at the beginning as i had played ME2 before this one but i enjoyed this one alot so i totally recommend it to anyone that likes massive open world with great storyline!
i just got back into this to find the Squad update had occurred.played for an hour and i just cant even tell what the devs were thinking, i just want simple af mm.became really glitched to the point of me restarting my pc
Possibly one of the best games of all time, get this game
