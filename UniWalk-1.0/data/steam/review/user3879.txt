Portal 2 Is a game where you play as the silent protagonist -'Chell-' in Aperture Laboratories or as one of two testing robots in the cooperative initiative. This game revolves around the one thing that aperture has time and time again proven is it-'s most valuable item, the Aperture Science handheld portal device, There are multiple versions but they come in two phases, singular and dual portal, with the singular, you can only place one portal. The dual alternative, you get the idea. Portal 2 revolves around puzzles in rooms and physics to get there, and it-'s all thanks to the man, Cave Johnson. Why buy it? It-'s a great game that doesn-'t just end at the end of the campaign / singleplayer / story, There-'s coop mode which allows you to buddy up locally or over the net, maybe even with a stranger if necessary. Even once you finish that there-'s more, community-made tests. There are so many you-'d be there for a whileif you plan to finish all of them. Why do people say cave hates lemons? Who is wheatley? Why is GLaDOS calling me a monster? -Let me answer those questions with a question: Who wants to make sixty dollars? Cash.- Not really, just stop asking questions and see it for yourself.
