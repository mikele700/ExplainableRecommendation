Fap material, but if you want to see all the chicks nude and -bang em all- you-'ll have to git gud otherwise the dates become harder than your ♥♥♥♥♥ on a Friday night
Good game I'ts really challenging
This game had potential to be an amazing open world sandbox, but instead everything that made starbound starbound has been removed and they made it into a story with progression, I liked starbound back in the beta when you could find tech in chests, like the bubble boost, where you could have tons of energy and there was 4 sectors, to travel to each one containing new and unique ore, this has all been removed and instead the only tech we get is boost jump and dash, now energy gets wasted fast and there's only one sector with most ore removed. 2 bosses have been removed and all the randomly generated weapons that where legendary and op have been removed, the rainbow cape and hood removed. This game has took a step backwards and sure they added ship upgrades and crew members but was it worth loosing all the cool ♥♥♥♥ the beta had to offer? Please add a feature where we can play previous builds so I can play the beta again with all this stuff still in the game I don't like this story idea, it ruins the self progression and makes gameplay less fun as you've done everything by the time you finish the story and there's nothing left to do, starbound has turned into an RPG from a sandbox and I want to see it get turned back to what it was
What is a game without bullets?...
