72 hrs later...I've hit the level cap.I hit PvP rank S.I ran out of things to do.11/10 would content again.To be clear; I have spent nothing on this game. It's not a difficult game, PvP is stupidly easy(using Add -> Mastermind), and I never farmed for anything except levels. Try it if you want, it's entertaining while it lasts.....I'm probably going to go make a new character and do all of it again now.Totally don't recommend.
Studio gets sued for $40 million.Studio releases DLC to save company.DLC is highly rated.Everyone ♥♥♥♥♥ on studio.-11/10 would be grateful again
