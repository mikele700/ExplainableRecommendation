well optimized, Solid physics and alot of fun. If you like to make stuff there is lots of room for that too with importing custom models and such. I highly reccomend it (P.S it kinda ripped of desperate gods http://www.wolfire.com/desperate-gods)
Its Cool And The customization is great but Microtranzactions have a high factor in this game SERIOUSLY why add customization if it cost money. yes income is required but i hate it when mt's are in one of the main parts of the game
All a bloody mess (literally) when you fight a black belt while being a white belt i played it for months before it on steam
totaly epic m9k mod goes great with this but it is absoloutly awesome8/10it justs seems to be missing something i cant tell what
(OLD Review)very cool a bit like minecraft but in space and not pixellated and blocky but still the building items are based of a block except some of them.
