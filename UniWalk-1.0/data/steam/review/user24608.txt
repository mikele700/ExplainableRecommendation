Really good game and much improved from Need for Speed Undercover. Its great as you get the option of either playing as the police or a racer. After choosing from the two types, there are multiple race modes to choose from such as regular races, time trials or classic police chases. Driving in a police car and busting racers, you get the ability to use Spike Strips, EMPs, Road Blocks and Helicopters. Controls are not too difficult and driving with precision can easily be acquired without much practice. Multiplayer is average as not many users play this game, but this is a game that can be played occasionally. Awesome game overall and would recommend to anyone who loves racing games :D
Fun and funny game and also you get to play as an animated block of meat :D
