Anyone who has liked Terraria would certainly like this game, Starbound starts you off in an unknown planet as you flee from your own home.The game is amazing and the thought of it being beta wouldn't occur to you, tons of features such as dungeons with unique enemies, interactive npcs, a wide variety of biomes, bosses, tiers and alot more.In addition the game gets updated often and is totally worth your money if you are a fan of terraria.
