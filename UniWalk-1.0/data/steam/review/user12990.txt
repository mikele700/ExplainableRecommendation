CsgO = Hold shift and buy headphones to win
Good game, however anyone I assume 'far' from the servers ( I am Oceanic) will have ping issues, and the game is especially about timing so it's incredibly frustrating getting pummeled because your actions do not register.
Pay to winThey changed server locations for cheaper option, 400 ping every gamePay to Progress
Nice gimmick, but boring and repetitive after  2 minutes.
It's average. Incredibly overhyped. Still riddled with a miriad of bugs, crashes and inconsistencies.
Will never come out of Early Access. Runs like ♥♥♥♥. Boring as ♥♥♥♥.
Rarely updated, abandoned by dev's. Stay away.
The movement in this game is completely and utterly broken, and always will be. Blatant pay to win / pay to level. Go play warthunder or an alternative. This game is truly bad.
The controls for this game are absolute ♥♥♥♥ing trash. Want to jump off a building whilst trying to climb? yea. Want to repeatedly die because 'let go of the wheel' is the same keyboard bind as 'slow down' ? Yea. Want to repeatedly pull out weapons and shoot the objective accidentally? yea. great game bar the ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious control ports.
As opposed to the original client, there is no pop up or notification that your game is ready. Be prepared to be banned/labelled a deserter after alt tabbing in a 7 minute que.
