The feel of the game is very much like Combat Arms or Counter strike (from my limited experience with CS) but cross bred with Battlefield or ARMA. I will sum up the first few hours of gameplay for you:1) Install game.2) Do the training and think it will be like COD4.3) Join a server and almost immediately get killed by a shot you didn-'t hear or see.3a) Mute every player on your team because all you hear is -ALOHA SNACKBAR!-4) Repeat #3 for the next 15-30min.5) Actually see someone before they kill you.6) Actually get a kill... and then be killed a fraction of a second later.7) After an hour or two, get shot at without dying, sh!t your pants and find the closest thing that will hopefully stop a bullet to hide behind so you can start sobbing.8) Change underwear and air out the room before anyone wakes up.9) Seek treatment for PTSD and/or rage quit the game.10) Start slaying bodies.11) Find out after 11+ hours you-'re still a n00b to be pwnt (repeatedly), rage and punch your monitor.12) Appreciate the robustness of LG monitors.All in all? 9/10 - I would definitely liberate peoples oil again...or jihad... AAALOHA SNAKBAAAAR!P.S: If you hear -RRRRPPPPEEEEGGGGGG!!!- don-'t bother trying to run, you-'re already dead.
Pretty good game all in all. I started getting bored with it after around 45 - 50 hours of gameplay mainly due to a lack of missions. Most of the DLC should be free IMO simply because it doesn't add enough to the game play to be worth paying for. Another gripe is that there is no way to buy or trade items with other players, due to the card drop system (one random card after each completed mission) it can be exceptionally hard to get some weapon accessories. After 103 hours of playing there are still some basic weapon accessories that i want and have been unable to get.I'll give it 7/10. Worth getting if it's on sale.
