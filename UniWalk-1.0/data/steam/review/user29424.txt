 Chairman's  BioShock Infinite  review Okay so it's hard to deny that the original  BioShock  was brilliant. An enticing duology that was highly praised for its originality and novelty. As a game on its own,  BioShock Infinite  was certainly an intriguing game, dealing with such themes as xenophobia, religion and racism. Those who don't have the expectations from the last BioShock games will certainly get a kick out of this game, but for me it just didn't live up to what I expect from a BioShock game and this has admittedly affected the way I view this game and has taken the pleasure out of my gameplay experience.Rating:  8.5/10 It's still a BioShock game.
Why has this only come out now?
