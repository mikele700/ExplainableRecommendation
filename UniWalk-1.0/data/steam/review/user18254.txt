I love playing Starving Simulator in other games, especially in zombie games where you can bond with each other over finding nothing :) , oh well it is early access and all, hopefully they fix loot spawns.
I love doing the Der Eisendrache easter egg, getting all the steps done and then to disconnect due to some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t server issue, this has happened 2 times in 2 nights, like wtf!
