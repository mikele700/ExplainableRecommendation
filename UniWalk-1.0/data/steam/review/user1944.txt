Remember when one of the studio leads at TW said in a statement that Call of Duty ruined a generation of gamers and followed that by making a game years later and deciding to put microtransactions in an unfinished early access title?Pepperidge Farm Remembers.You'd think they would have learnt from OVERKILLS mistakes on that last bit there.
I swear to god this game is Bains side project to pay for his bad one liners and internet connection...I mean... It'd explain the f***ing 37 DLCs (not a joke).I'm done with this. I'm going back to PD1...
For $15 and the amount of potential this game has, it's worth every cent/second you put into it!Crafting is alot more fun than most others and even the inventory screen is really well made to a survival aesthetic.If you need to see it just check out Frankieonpcin1080p and his video. He sums it up better than I can anyway :)

I'm going to smack a positive on this just because it has incredible potential should the devs listen to the players. Only had a few issues but it was worth the $8.
