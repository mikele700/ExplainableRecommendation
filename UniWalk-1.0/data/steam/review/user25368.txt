Destroyed my ♥♥♥♥♥ Masturbating to this game, 10/10
A great combo system, a good diffucultly curve and some top notch PvP. But the ugly part is the worst, Pay for 4 more skill slots when you basically have more than 4 skills to use and No-sense of Currency conversion with perm skillslots (For only one Char) being 10 bucks. Still a great game, 8/10
Maximum.Lolidrive wasn't taken, 10/10
I still have no idea about sekx, 9/11
Great FPS, The controls handle well and are responsive, the gameplay is seriously good and amazing.
Its fantastic, you need it thats all i have to say.
What are you, Casual?
