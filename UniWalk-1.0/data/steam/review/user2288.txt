Game needs some optimization for AMD users, but im enjoying it thoroughly.Ignore overwatch fanboys. this game is completely different.
Bought this game years back, never regretted it once. like GMOD with lego, you can waste hours just messing about with friends or on games like pecons boss battles.i highly recommend trying this game out.
Dont let the cheapskates fool you. this DLC is worth the 10$ price tag. The mission is rather short, but enjoyable. the real fun is where the robot customization is, being able to have a companion robot with a mister handy booster for maximum speed, two flamethrowers for insects and ghouls, and a hacking module because you dont have a high INT. the customization is unreal and you can make your companion a force to be reckoned with, or a pack mule to carry your stuff (the maximum carry weight on your robot is amazing!)The eye bot pods you can unlock by finding the blueprints in the mechanists' lair is also very helpful. you build one in your settlement, and set it to find either components, ammunition(of any kind! including mininukes, cannonballs, and rail spikes!), or explosives(baseball grenades, pulse grenades, etc)i found this feature extraordinarily helpful when building my bots, and great for upgrading my weaponry, because i didnt have to waste caps on shipments or waste too much time scouring locations for rare materials.(unfortunately you cannot scavenge gold. but every other material is available, including crystal, fibre optics, and nuclear material!)This DLC is definitely worth the 10$ USD i spent on it,and hey, at least it isnt a goat simulator heist.
