This is an amazing. Play this for a day and you'll know what i'm talking about
Broforce is an amazing game. It is a tie in to explandables 3 and a demo to Broforce. It is a retro shooter where you can destroy EVERYTHING! This makes it fun and original. Its graphics are retro like but pleasing no less. You could get many hours out of this game even with its 10 or so levels.I give Broforce an 8/10
There is so many plot twists and sad moments and..... JUST GET IT AND STOP READING REVIEWS
