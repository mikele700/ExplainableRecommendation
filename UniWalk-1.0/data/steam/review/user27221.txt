In Elite dangerous you can do almost anything you would want in a space sim. You could become a trader and trade between star systems. Become a bounty hunter or a Pirate, you could also become an explorer and visit over 200 billion star systems. The freedom to do what you want is why i am giving this game 10/10 one of my favourite games to date.
awsome this a must have game
