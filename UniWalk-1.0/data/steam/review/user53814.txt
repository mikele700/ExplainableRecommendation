God damn this is one amazing game.The graphics and soundtrack really remind me of games I used to play when I was really young. The gameplay itself is very fun and engaging, and the puzzles are quite challenging but without being too hard. Overall it's an amazing game. It's worth $10 but you can currently get it from the Humble Bundle for $1+.
Great game, I love it. So many game modes, you will never run out of fun. If you like platformers, you will like Garrys Mod. If you like physics games, you will like Garry's Mod. If you like shooters, you will like Garry's Mod.
Very bad glitch on mac. Bottom of screen is yellow and you cant see anything.
