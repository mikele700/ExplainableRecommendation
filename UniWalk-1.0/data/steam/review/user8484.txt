GET THIS GAME!
I love this game but everyone says the community in game is great but not with my experiences. 1: accidently clicked shoot instead of aim and killed a dude on my team then i imedeatly got shot in the head by a guy on my team then got rage in chat and i apologise and still get the hate!!!! 2: it was pretty recent, we were playing house we threw grenades mine happened to miss and landed by someones feet (idk how he didnt notice it) then a tem mates instant reaction is -im Glaz and i have an OP weapon- and shoots me in the friken head!!!! god dammit its so annoying because you have just lost one team mate so u instantly kill another one?????? smart very smart oh and btw we lost both of those matches. but yea i love this game and recomend it greatly!!!!
