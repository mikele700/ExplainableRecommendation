Its a good classic if your new to the game your probs better off buying GO but if you r already learning the basics this a good choice it also works on windows 7
Before you buy this games I suggest you get counter strike scource or half life 2 since alot of the textures are used from those games. This game is really about creating objects levels gameplay and even more for the community or playing other popular gamemodes like trouble in terrorist town (popular on youtube) zombies survival, murder and much more. If you dont enjoy the creative part you will most likely love the player created gamemodes and servers.
Its a good classic but part of doesnt want to come back to the game unless a friend and imight go for a round. But unless with maybe a couple of mods it gets a bit dull.
