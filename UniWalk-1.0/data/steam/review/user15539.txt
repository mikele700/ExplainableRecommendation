I played this game before It went on steam and have always enjoyed  it. Its a great game if you like historical world war 2 shooters with a bit of teamwork tactics. I  cannot say much in regard to the games -stratagey element- as I only played that aspect for a small ammount of time it seemed simple and based on trying to cheat the game instead of having war proper plan.  The game comes under allot flak every few months  for failures to balance factions/weapons or implement a good matchmaking system although at times these problems are certainly noticeable in my experince with the game it never stopped me playing it and enjoying it. There is noticeable grind to get into the game but if you truly like this type of shooter you can easily overcome it.
