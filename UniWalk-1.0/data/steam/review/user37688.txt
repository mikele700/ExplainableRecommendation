+This game looks amazing for a 2004 release.+Story wasn't fantastic as far as I made it, but I was looking forward to it, nonetheless-Buggy ladders-Buggy stairs-AI can spot you from a mile away (edit:  they can spot you from unreasonably far away, and many times were spotting me from behind tents and such)-Missing textures (probably from a bad patch, don't know, honestly don't care anymore)-It refuses to even start on the highest graphic settings-I have to crash the game to get out of itBUT HEYI tried.  I really tried SO hard to love this game.It's simply not fun.  I made it almost half way without cheats.And even the devmode cheats couldn't get me through.I will not finish this game.Would be great if the AI weren't gods among men (and I'm on the easiest setting)edit:  AMD FX 8350, single R9 270x, 16GB ram, 7200RPM HDs
Great game!  (One of the very few fighting games I personally like)Devs are great about updating and keeping things well balanced.However, the DLC prices (extra characters for $5 a piece) are flatout robbery.
Does anyone else notice the -fuuuu- meme face when secondary-firing the REX launcher?  ahhahaCombining FPS/tower-defense in a game was a fantastic idea.  The game is great, but it-'s best with full 4P multiplayer.Strategy will come into play on harder levels, since you have a limited about of weapons to carry and type-of-units to be able to build, but when things get intense, the result can be very rewarding.
