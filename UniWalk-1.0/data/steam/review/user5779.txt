Yes, it is a MOBA. Yes, it is Highly competitive. Yes it is addictively fun. Valve takes Warcraft 3's famous mod to a new level with this multiplayer only game. The servers are not the best, and the game doesn't like >300,000 people online at any given time, but the community is diverse and everyone aspires to be the best.
One of the most beautiful games I've EVER played, and one of the most challenging. Arma III is an essential game for any would-be FPS player as it exclusively immerses the player and requires co ordination and immense teamwork. I recommend it simply because it is a beautiful game.
