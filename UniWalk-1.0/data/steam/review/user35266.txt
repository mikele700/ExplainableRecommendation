One of the most interesting games I have ever played, learning the science of making planes, trying to re-create planes I have seen. I have got many hours out of this game and will get many more, if your a creative person or like planes BUY THIS GAME :D
Very concise and well made game. Tight controls, nice visuals, GREAT sound track. I finished in 2 hours but I didnt get all the secrets. This seems like an interesting game to learn to speedrun, there are some tricky sections and tricks. I absolutely reccomend this game for a thoroughly  entertaining 2-3 hours.
