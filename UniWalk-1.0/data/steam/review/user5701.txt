I have been playing this game for A while and after I retired from my parliment duties this game has been helping me forget about my past role as Australia's PM.
Its hard when you first start off but it is very fun once you get the hang of it!!!
Very good likes to kill Australian WIFI though
Very good with lots of mods aswell, the game never gets old
