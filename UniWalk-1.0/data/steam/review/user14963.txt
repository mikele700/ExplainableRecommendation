One of my favourtie indie games. Has a die for soundtrack. The story is quite interesting and will keep you playing and with all the secrets there is replay value!
Pretty good free to play. But its one of those free to plays. Pay to win.
An interesting type of RPG I only got this game because I was going 2 get it on the orginal xbox and it was worth buying it now
Great Game with alot of puzzles
Fast Paced Game Very Addictive
Play This with freinds a hole lot more fun
