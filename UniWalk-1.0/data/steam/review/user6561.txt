Really fun game Love making new worlds
This game made me have cancer x100 I tried playing with my mate. thinking it would be a fun time I was thinking to good for this bucket of ♥♥♥♥ ass game. The music is to loud I had to shout to talk to my friend also The lan is so BAD they cant even set up there own server network. Kill me now. Fix this now or you will not get far. it has alot to offer if the devs were not 6 year olds eatting there own ♥♥♥♥. thank you I rate this A cancer out of lung cancer xAids thank you again.......
Aram 3 is a game that most gamers need, i have put over 100 hours and am still finding new things out its very fun with or without friends and buying this is worth it. I have played massive 60 player missions and they were very tactical. JUST GET THE GAME
