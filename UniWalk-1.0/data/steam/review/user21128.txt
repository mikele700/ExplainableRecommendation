Little Inferno-A game in which you burn stuff... What else could you want.MY LIFE IS NOW COMPLETE
Monaco is a game in which you, along with a band of other criminals go on ridiculous endeavors to go on heists, clear evidence of previous heists and so much more. It has its own simple but very unique and dynamic art style which is not quite retro but in a pixelated look; and dont get me started on the music. This is one of the best factors of this game, with a quirky piano solo in the backround which suddenly escalates as you alert security. The storyline is also exellent as you play the roles of many different characters, each with their own funny personality. As you play through the campain, the story develops and twists and creates great suspence and enjoyment. I fail to get bored of this game with the huge amounts of extra campains adding to the backstory and the almost infinite amount of crazy workshop created levels which you can play with friends. 10/10
