From the smooth as silk combat system to the open worldness of Mordor, this game is almost flawless. Ratbag is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but he's easily put to the side. Also, the nemesis system that they advertised actually works, which was a big surprise for such a bold claim. This game breaks barriers in video games... and there's Gollum10/10
This is definately one of my favourite games at the moment. It is a game that requires a ton of patience though, so if you are used to Call Of Duty, then this game is probably not for you.
