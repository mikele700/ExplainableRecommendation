Sigh, if only downloading it was as quick as uninstalling it. Another game I could even play because of this -punkbot-. Sad, really wanted to play this game.
Utter ♥♥♥♥. Couldn't even play the game because of 'General error, could not connect to host'. There seems to be no good answer to this problem as the only 'solutions' are allowing it through your fire wall, and changing your DNS which didn't work, slowed down my internet, and It doesn't even semm worth going through all that trouble for a game like this. Really disappointedOverall rateing 0/10 - waste of computer spacePros - NoneCons - couldn't even ♥♥♥♥ing play the game
