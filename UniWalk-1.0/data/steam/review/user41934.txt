This game is absolutely terrible now, the only servers available to me at the moment are ones with password, so there is no possible way to just quickly join a public server... i want a refund but sadly cannot get one anymore. sort it out guys your game has been in development for too long now......
The amount of tim tam biscuits i can fit in my mouth is outstanding, i really like to do arts and crafts and i like the occasional cup of tea.i enjoy water spots and long walks with no pants on.11/10 would fap again
found a retardly big tree leading to ash lake which id never been there before and died and had a mission, and that mission was to return to my corpse to recover my loot, and though i did have my ring of sacrifice JUST incase, i got cursed and died on my way back leading to me losing my decent chunk of humanity. but do you think i care? NOPE i think of my humanity being lost as a sign to why i realy enjoy the texture of my pants.11/10
