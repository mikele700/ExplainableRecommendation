This game may look silly. And some of it is.But mostly it's really ♥♥♥♥ed up and weird.I got Nagaki's ending first, which is really sad.10/10, would coo again.
If you have a Mac of any kind, don-'t get this game.It will not work. Usually it gets to the tutorial, but after you click -Done-, the game crashes.
A few things:This game can disconnect you at will which is extremely annoying. It's fun as all hell. And rail guns are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because they can kill you from half way across the world like it's nothing.
Get extremely powerful upgradesGet to floor before MomAlmost beat bossStray shot hits me, dead.10/10 would play again
