Okay straight off the Bat, This game isn't perfect, But still is there even a game out there that doesn't have any flaws?If you like messing with simulators or Locomotives you should give this game a look, from pulling power to speed to weight and to acceleration, every locomotive and freight car feels different.Now here is where most people complain, The amount of DLC, I don't see it as a bad thing, in fact i see it as a good thing, This is because it gives the ability to pick and mix what you like, i have not seen many games that allow you to do that. For example i really like American Locomotives but am not much of a fan on European Locomotives, I can then go through and see that many suit my taste and are not bundled with European locomotivesPlus there is a Giant modding community which have made their own locomotives and freight, as well as scenery for the map editorOverall, This game isn't perfect but it is fun
Car Crash Simulator, Beaten only by Beam NG, This is quite a fun game, though the songs do get repetetive
