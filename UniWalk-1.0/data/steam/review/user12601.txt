I'll be honest. I got this because I love the empires series. but the graphics lack and the awkward camera translation to PC really ruin the vibe for me.If you're looking for a Empires experience, buy it, but be warned its not optimised for PC at allupon putting more time into the game.  I've noticed that seriously... You feel like a god. like in the old ones, sure. the little peon troops all died easy enough, but on the harder difficulties they did some damage, in this one, I can set difficulty to chaos. then proceed to casually walk to the enemy main camp, use one musou attack, and win the mission.  Its a bit pathetic really...
