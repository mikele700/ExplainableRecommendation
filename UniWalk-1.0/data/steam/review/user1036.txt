Actress vikings! Strongmen with a fearof the dark! Giant spider queen egg-nest-thingies! Never-spoiling Twinkies! This game is nothing like minecraft! Or terraria! Great game. I'd give it a 9.9/10, mainly because i can't survive with mods. But hey! 10/10 anyways! But yeah, this game is as worth your money as most people perceive Ocarina of Time. But If you DON'T like OOT, then it's still VERY worth ya money! Bored with the game?REIGN OF GIANTS!BADGER BEARS! DRAGON FLIES! GOOSES!.... mooses? GMOOSES!MODS!YEAH!10.5/10.
