Worst purchase on Steam so far. I got tricked into buying this mediocrity by over-hyped gaming media and I regret every second of owning it. Unfortunately it happened way before steam introduced refund system, so this product will forever sit in my steam library as a silent reminder of why I lost trust in games sites.
