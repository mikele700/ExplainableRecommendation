The Forest is an open-world survival horror game. It is in its alpha stage and with comes a bunch of bugs but this game is FREAKING FUN, its is also very freaking hard that is if your just starting out like I am. Althought the game isnt much at the moment, if the developers keep going at it, iron out the game breaking bugs this game will turn out to be one of the best survival games of ALL-TIME and I highly recommend it.
I can not reccomend this games simply because I just don't like anything about it
