Awesome little strategy game.
There were alot of things i enjoyed about this game, Story, hacking obsticals in the polices face, Spiderbots of death, but the Invasion system was not one of them, Tedious, Repeditive and always seem to occur at the worst times. You'll be steps away from capping a CTOS tower after jump/climbing and hacking your way there only to get intruded and have to spend the next 20 mins trying to find who did it only to get a supprise rocket launcher to the face from the top of a carpark way off in the distance... then have to go back and start climbing again.There is an option in the menu to turn it off but it appears the button is about as usefull as man nipples because even with invasions turned off i still get my gameplay interupted by a bullet from the bushes.
Free and pretty damn funn
