After about 2 hours:Great game, gets boring just digging for caverns, but once you find them it is cool. Well worth the money.After 200+ hours:I cannot believe the amount of hours you can play this game for the $2.49 it cost me in the Steam Summer Sale. The newest update added many more hours of gameplay. Once you start playing multiplayer, many more hours accumulate. There are a lot of entities in the game, and it is very difficult to keep track to them at first. Use the wiki available to find out about any part of the game, you'll find that the huge amount of weapons, blocks, mobs and boss challenges mean that the game can be played for hours on end, without crafting the same weapon or fighting a same boss twice.
