The thing about Team Fortress 2 is that it doesn't feel repetitive after playing for hours and hours. There are 9 different classes for you to switch freely, on top of that you got different loadouts which in turn gives a different playstyle. (Demoknights, for example)Apart from that, this game is undoubtedly NOT a pay to win game. (Albeit there is some who hates f2p with a passion). The only thing you get for spending $ on Team Fortress 2 is that you will have extra backpack slots and the ability to trade.
I am no professional at writing reviews but if you ask me if this game is worth buying.I will say yes.

Maybe I need to find some time and actually play the game.
Really COLORFUL game, I don't really understand what I am playing though.Just shoot everything that can be shot at PEWPEWPEWPEWPEW
Storyline and gameplay is nice, definitely worth a shot.
Story mode is damn fun, definitely recommend you to try.Multiplayer for me is just plain boring.
