este juego cambio mi forma de ver las cosas y mis pensamientos , no mentira sigo siendo el mismo aweonao xdes entretenido este simulador tiene mucho sentida y logica y tambien es penoso :c
Unturned is an entertaining game, Here give my opinion of the game: Unturned is a survival game like Day Z, because you're a guy you have to build your house and collect things for their survival and the cities are infected zombies. you need food, drinks and antibiotics to reduce the detoxification (detoxification increases when hit by a zombie). The game is fun to play in multiplayer, because having friends makes you share your items with others and has to use a lot of cooperation so that all players have things necessary to defend against waves of zombies. when I started to survive in the game, I thought it would be a game like rust, minecraft, terraria, etc.. but I found it different, there are many more things to do and what matters most in this game is the way to be able to have enough things to survive, from when you start to when you finish, the path between the two is as much fun in this game. Never give up on the game as always will have something to help you succeed. the concluion is that it is one of the best games that are survival and is in beta, the game is complete when the probability of finding the most entertaining game that was in beta will be higher. Keep updating unturned, having a good life.
