it is ok for a free game but 15gb of space???
I really like Unturned but the thing that i want to be improved or fixed:-Gas in cars and planes lasts longer.-More guns and ammo.-More maps.-Better Servers.-More health for all players.-Better inventory space and organise.Apart from those things i rate 8/8 no h8 m8!!!!
I realy like this game it has gotten me to undersatnd alot more about farming
