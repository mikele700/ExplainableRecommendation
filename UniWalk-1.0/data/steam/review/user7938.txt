Its like Dayz with a graphics downgrade. But it's free. My only issue is once you get looted, you get bored (until out of the blue you get ♥♥♥♥ed)Yeah, it's true what they say about admins though, kill them and get ready for torture as they teleport back and demand you give the their stuff back. Yeah good game though.
