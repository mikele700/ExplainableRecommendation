like sweet mother of god, i am adicted!!
this game is quite imersive, with the combat changing depending on in air or not and attacks working off of arial launces are a interesting factor. the talent system is fairly reasonable, and the combat really takes you away from the mmo's typical tab target system. its a welcome change. it would use some more texture re vamping and better lightning systems, and maybe a gor feature for people who like the whole anime style but want a more graphic exsperiance. and perhaps linking all of the gate way maps together so you dont have to suffer loading screams all the time.other then thies small details the games build is quite solid. and has a high potental.
