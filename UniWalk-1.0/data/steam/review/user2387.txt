good game to play its the old school games that make people throw their own computer out the window in rage and play a easier game that makes them feel better
You can get a sword that fires cats.....11/10 - IGN -its ok-
Sure why not buy the game look at the title and not want to play it even you dont know what to do
Source Filmmaker is a tool that valve uses to make all the trailers for the games unless they use another animatior engine which I doubt.Anyway at the start of the Software i will admit it was like buttons and the word no map loaded every time I played it it was so confusing. When I see other people videos on Youtube i start to be frustrated on how they learnt it. But then I looked on the tutorials Link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2B46DEB4157E67C4 that helped me out very much i was able to make a profile picture and other pictures but even though when you make a video and it doesnt look like other ones dont give up on  it because you will improve
this game is a cross between Minecraft and DayZ by people have to survive with the infection of zombies.It is easy to get use to but the inventory sucks at start but it is a zombie apocolypce whats would happenafter a while on the game you would get used to it and have fun but i still think they could add more.i would give it a 8/10 for Unturned
