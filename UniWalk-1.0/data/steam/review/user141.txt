My childhood game has finally gotten onto steam...AND IT'S WORTH IT!
Who knew that the man on the mens toliet bathroom door was overpowered.
The game that made me scream at the protaginist to just get the damn girl. Also I CAN TYPE SUPER FAST IN THIS GAME.
Best neko simulator ever made. They seriously need to make a Vol. 2. AND THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE NEKO GAMES
After playing this again, and again, and again i can finally decide that i should make a review for this. This game is amazing especially if you're a south park fan. This game is a RPG styled game, kinda like Mario and Luigi back in time, you can pick a class to choose between: Fighter, Mage, Thief and Jew. For me personally i liked the Fighter the best, his skills were my favourites. This game is worth the money, although it is short if you rush it (Which i didn't) this game will be worth you're time. Have fun!
Amazing, Just purely amazing. I loved this game, the sad thing is that it only took me 2 days to finish it. Since i did get the DLC things i played as the criminal, his story was pretty sad. Anyways, this game is just amazing. You should tottaly get this! 10/10
Very harsh to new players. Combat system is strange but is still sort of playable in a way...Fighting against players who have way more experience against someone with low hours is really the worst.
well, it's a 5/10 for me, i mean it's a great game with wonderful graphics but...you can't even see yourself reload! that's just stupid! and the god dam assualt rifle is useless as crap. Although i did enjoy it a little. I would say you should buy this game if you don't like seeing yourself reload and you like games where you can shoot, build and survive.
