This game is amazing it is fun exciting hard with out being top hard and a great grasp on zombie survival games well done
Gunpoint is an amazing game that takes stealth seriously. You get a gun... well if you shoot it gives you about 20 seconds until the cops arrive some enemys you cant take down. basically stealth is your only option. If you want a great stealth game with build your own level I would definately recommend it. 4 stars.
This game has days of fun and new things to do, Great way to spend 10$
