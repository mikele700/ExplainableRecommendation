suits a casual RPG but don't expect it anything fantastic. The combat is definetly highlight to this game, was the only reason why i put so many hours into it.The rest of the game mechanics are pretty average.If you are after a casual RPG that isn't very difficult and is quite basic then check this out. Don't bother with the DLC though especially the Weapon and Armor Bundle....
has a fantastic loot system and plenty of challenging enemies. one of a kind
great game, easy to learn
