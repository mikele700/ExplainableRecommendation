BUY...THIS...GAME!!!! 'nuff said
It's super fun if you have friends to play with or are just a generally friendly person.It is a bit glitchy but you can live with it because it's in alpha.
Got Bashed with a rock in the first few seconds of spawning, but seriously once you get into it it's really fun especially with friends.
