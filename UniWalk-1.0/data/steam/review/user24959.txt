The game is not as good as forged alliance but it is better for people who don’t have a fast computer. The factions don’t have as much of a wide variety of units but the fact that the non experimentals are around the same level means that you don’t have to worry about having to constantly tier up. One of the problems though is the tech research the having to research the individual techs, although this dose mean you can make your units stronger and have special perks something the old game lacked. As much as the cybrans have pretty over powered units compared to the other teams the other teams can beat the cybrans by using the right tactics. I rate this game9/10   for the ultra powerful cybran dinosaur
