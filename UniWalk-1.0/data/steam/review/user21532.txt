Prison Architect is an early-access strategy game where you manage a prison. What can go wrong? Alot, as it turns out. the basis of the game is to make your prisoners happy while making money on your prison, ever expanding to contain more and more prisoners. As it's early-access, there are various bugs, minor details that need explaining, and, of course, more content. As it stands, though, it is solid and fun, and the modding community adds alot to it as well.
