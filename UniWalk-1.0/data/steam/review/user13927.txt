BEST. GAME. EVER.
ZOMBIES YAYYY
 After seeing the reviews on this game, i decided not to get it, thinking it was bad. What a mistake i made. this multiplayer shooter my look like a minecraft ripoff gone wrong, but it isn't. this game was recommended to me by my friend yesterday. and i haven't stopped playing it since. Yeah, i know people can spawncamp with op weapons, just join a different server. So what if the graphics are bad, its in early access so it will get better. I honestly think this is a good game and you should definitely give it a go.
Team Fortress 2 Is a game where you can laugh with your friends about that guy you just shot.
