A simple idea for a game but one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played. It is as much as game as it is an experience with the -spacey- music it has. This game is a couple of dollars well spent.
There are games that do certain things better but imo this is the best overall. I mainly played GT series on PS before pCars. Anyone that says you can't play with M&K or controller is just being an idiot you can play fine with them. Pros:The best racing game I've played in terms of:Graphics,Sound,Tracks.Cons:Lack of cars,AMD runs poorly on Ultra (just turn particles to low, fixed it for my friend at least.)
