Found the game to be a huge hit, loved the campaign and the RPG aspect of it, but its one flaw would have to be the leveling system, for the most part you're stuck with the characters you level up in the beginning because there are no low level enimies you can go back and fight. though of course there are ways around it by of course, partaking in huge grinding sessions to level low level characters up, but for those who aren't so patient, it can be a hassle.Although most characters within the game, are still useful and if characters are beginning to get weaker you do have ways to deal with it. all in all the game has about a 5 hour campaign filled with fun gameplay mechanics, espcially if you're that of a pokemon fan, it is also accompanied with honestly a quite interesting story with some funny lines and quotes, and choice of multiplayer if you so wish.if you're into any of the things stated above, i think this is the game for you. I personally would definately play though this game again. 9/10
