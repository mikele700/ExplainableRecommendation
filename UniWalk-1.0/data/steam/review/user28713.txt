I've spent countless hours on this game, partially becuase steam doesnt count the hours for the actual launcher exe... XD But in all seriousness, this game is amazing. Maybe the graphics arent as good as COD or ArmA 3 (some mods can make it look amazing), but this game is simply awesome once you really get into it.With new content and fully interactable aircraft coming out every year, it never gets boring. If you're even remotely interested in aircraft, fixed wing or rotary, this is the game for you. The rewarding experience once you put time into this game and learn the aircraft is very great and well worth the time. As for the money side of things, the first free aircraft (SU-25T) you get is nice, however I would strongly recommend purchasing a DLC such as the A-10C, even if it does seem overpriced. However if you want to get your money out of it, you need to be dedicated and patient as you learn certain aircraft.Warning: Steep learning curve for some aircraft - be prepared to spend a bit of time learning them.P.S. The reward will be worth it. Trust me :)
This game is amazing. Amazing. I can't believe how good this game is for five dollars. FIVE DOLLARS! This Survival: postapocalypse Now is by far the best game i've ever played for under 20$. The game really does feel great, There aren't any bugs I have encountered, and I've had fun every minute I've been playing it, but be warned, depending on your luck, it could either be a pvp or very friendly game. I highly recommend playing with a friend or two. With this game, you really do get what you pay for, plus more.Overall I think it is underpriced, and you know a game's good when you play it for almost 5 hours from when you download it and have to go to sleep! :)
