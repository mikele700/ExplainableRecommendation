I absolutely loved exploring a different coloured version of the same planet over and over again to collect resources to warp to another place with different coloured versions of the same planet.
When I first opened this game, I felt the inner weeb come out of me, I'm 20 minutes in and am fluent in Japanese weeb languague.
This game is very good for just playing solo and with a bunch of friends. In most multiplayer games there are people that are toxic or just try to make your day bad, in CS:GO, this only rarely happens.BUY THIS GAME IF U ARE LOOKING FOR:- Good FPS shooter- Competitive gaming for each skill level- Nice community- A game to play with friends or by yourself- Hackers get banned easily, little to no hackers 
Too good, Really immersive.
