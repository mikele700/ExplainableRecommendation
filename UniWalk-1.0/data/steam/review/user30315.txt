3 words if youre new to cs and bought this game; welcome to hell
teabagging and camping have never been so intense
great game, regardless the fact that its still beta (with forgivable glitches). the best thing about this is it is one of those few games that arent pay 2 win, and you dont need a tryhard computer to actually enjoy it. its a concoction of the teamwork of tf2 with the gunplay of cod, although i would recommend the devs to add more guns for one merc and a customization option
