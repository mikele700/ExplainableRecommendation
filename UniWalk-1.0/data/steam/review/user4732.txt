Do you like the smell of Adventure? Yes? then this game is for you! Become a Legend.
Whats not to like? It's a fun and brilliantly made game that has a lot of realism and immerison, which every gamer, like myself, loves.
It's a pretty awesome game even though it's still in Alpha. Once all the bugs and glitches are fixed, yes i'm looking at you invisable noclip zombies, this is going to be one of the greats. Can't wait until the full release.
Do you like Zombie survival? Do you like Minecraft? how about DayZ? If yes to all then this game is for you! just beware of other survivors, some aren't to friendly.
Real fun game. i think the Knights are adorable.
Age of Empires 2, ahh i remember this game back when i was a small lad. i used to play this on my old dinosaur computer for hours.
