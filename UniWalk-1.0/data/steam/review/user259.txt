MY FAVORITE CALL OF DUTY BUY NOW OR REGRET NOT GETTING ITGREAT SINGLEonly problem is some servers with hackers and xp hackBUT THE BEST SINGLE PLAYER I HAVE EVERY PLAYED.9/10
The game is ok I just wish they would not limit their game to only 3 guns and have multiple or just more than 3because it gets boring after you play about a hour of it in my perspective
Great multiplayernot to shabby campaginspec ops pretty funbut its like nothing happened after Call of Duty 4 because it was in the middle east now its in russia.and why do you keep changing People in Call of Duty 4 you were Soap and now your allenWhy.... whats the point.4.5/10
What to say about arma 2...... Great Graphics, Great Detail, Great Land, and you get to fly planes and helicopter and drive tanks and cars and stuff like dat. i know battlefield has that but its not like Arma 2 you can zoom hip fire, you can zoom aim down sights, you can use a map and gps.  in all great game but its fall point is that it has many bugs with the multiplayer and the campagin isnt the best. i give it a 6/10 only because of its bugs.
Great story line but it is kinda a screw over, 8/10
In Watch_Dogs I found that the story is great but there are some random things that go on for no reason.  It tends to be laggy unless you have a powerful CPU.   You get a wide selection of people because it randomizes it.  One bad thing the hacking is kinda linear its only things that are ran by computers and it limits you on that you cant go and hack a building to turn their lights off (execpt for blackout but my point is you can turn ONE building off).  The multiplayer is not the best but It is not that bad. sure its confusing on how to join multiplayer for your first time but you figure out sometime.  Note, Get the DLC because it helps the story A LOT.  So my rating for this game would have to be a...  7/10 Not entirly bad but It does have its down points.
