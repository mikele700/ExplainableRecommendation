isometric action rpg with a highly configurable sword as your weapon. collect attacks as you progress.you don't have to deal with a title screen menuhold tab to hum to the musiccan be played with just the mousecan be played with mouse and keyboardcan be played with just a controlleryou can pause time by entering turn mode and queue up a bunch of attacksduring turn mode the game displays predicted results of each move you make. (prediction is a bit odd, pushing enemies away might make you miss a subsequent short range attack)alt-tabbing out of the game switches sound to some ambient sound rather than going silentall UI elements and in-world details and turn mode overlays, including battle borders have a lot of neat animations going onlots of lore to unlock and readin-world designs includes painted imagery of electronic components and PCB without making it garish like games from the 90shas a newgame+ mode that can be repeated many times without resetting your character stats. all battles are scaled appropriately
sidescrolling adventure with some elements of metroidvania (not so many weapons) and RPG (not too much inventory items)controls perfectly on keyboard and mouse and controller (xinput only?)art is so pretty. the backgrounds even react to your wind attacksweet orchestral musicmarvellous example of a pc port, with mouse driven menus, editable HUD, and colour blind mode. art is higher resolution than original console version.lots of dialogue when talking to NPCs, with animated portraits (which have an option to use compressed version or higher quality version using more memory)all dialogue is voiced with a wide range of accents
