The gameplay is great i love it but nothing else works. The matchmaking is ♥♥♥♥, Uplay is ♥♥♥♥, I should not need to reconfigure my router to be able to play with my friends, this game is not worth $60 but you can get it for less on other websites which i am under the belief i cannot mention without the names getting censored by steam. For a triple A game it should not have nearly as many problems as it does have. However i am completely hooked at the moment and have sunk a good amount of hours into this game and i am still having fun, if you do buy this be ready to bear the agony and frustration that this game brings.
