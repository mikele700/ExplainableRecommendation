Terraria is an amazing game. Many people compare it to Minecraft, but it's much more combat based, with bosses, beasts in the night and countless weapons from assault rifles and bows to swords and magic spells. However it has no storyline, quests or any of the sort. Yes, you can do fishing quests and catch specific fish for the NPC, but more of story/questing would improve the experience just a bit.Overall it's crazy fun, especially in multiplayer. Completely recommended.9/10
Don't Starve is an incredible game. The graphics are a unique and endearing style, the controls nicely set out and the challenge of the game all combine to make it what it is. Probably one of my favourite parts about this game, discluding the graphics (which I love), is having only one life. You die, it's game over, unless you have stumbled upon a rare touch-stone, granting you an extra life. You have to be ready and think ahead to avoid losing everything, and when you get to low health, it's time to go into panic mode. There are so many dangers, keeping an eye on your hunger, picking flowers to avoid going insane, having enough light to last through the night and all the monsters found in this game make it an amazing experience. The crafting aspect of the game is also very nicely done, collecting the resources and building the machines you need to advance further into the game. The only downfall is the inability to multi this game and share this experience with your friends. It would be amazing to be able to play Don't Starve with your friends, competing against or looking after each other, but sadly it is not able to be done. All in all, this game is an unforgettable experience that I will keep coming back to time and time again, to try and get further than I did last time and to see what I missed out on because I hadn't made it that far yet.9/10
