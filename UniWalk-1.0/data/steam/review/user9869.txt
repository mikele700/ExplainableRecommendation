Subnautica is a brilliantly made survival and creative game. You will quickly develop a fear for the ocean's depths as you venture further and deeper from the safety of the Safe Shallows. Progress isn't too slow or fast, however you will reach the end game fairly easily depending on how quickly you progress. The end game isn't challenging because of the agressive monsters you meet as you will quickly learn how to counter their attacks (I heard this will change in the near future however), but more so the hours you will spend gathering resources if you are the type of person that loves creating new bases and outposts. There are plently of biomes to explore (Deep Grand Reef and The Mushroom Caves are my favourite). Subnautica is a great singleplayer game but would be even better if you were able to play with friends. I currently have 60 hours in Subnautica but it is bound to rise as I've yet to experience everything this game has to offer! I HIGHLY suggest this game is you are a fan of survival or creative sandbox games as there is currently a lot to do and even more coming in the future.10/10
