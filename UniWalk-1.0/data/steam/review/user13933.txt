I highly recommend this game, yeah sure, I was hesitent at first to buy it, I looked at many reviews and videos to see if it was worth the money but it was worth it! I swear, I'm already loving it, this game is one of the best games I EVER played. I LOVE IT TO BITS. Yes, the graphics can be off-putting but I swear it really isn't that bad, I bet most of us would rather prefer a high quality gameplay rather than high quality looks.It is highly customizable if you're tired of vanilla M&B: Warband, there are many great mods out there for Warband. I find this game fun and addicting but it can get hard for newcomers, but once you get the hang of it then it gets slightly easier, I truly love this game if you haven't figured it out yet.
Fun game.This game is a lot more fun with your friends and there are servers for you to play with others but that does not exactly mean playing with others is better. You could always be a lone wolf.This is a free game for you and your friends to play casually but it also has an option to support the developer by buying the Gold Upgrade while getting extremely useful upgrades to increase your amount of fun playing Unturned.
Best Game ever.
