So easy unlike other scribblenauts games in the past. I recommend this game for 10 year olds and bellow if they have nothing to do whatsoever in the summer holidays.
All I can say about this game is... DON'T PLAY IT,DON'T EVEN LOOK AT IT,DO THIS AND YOU MIGHT LIVE!!!
Plants vs Zombies is a great game for newbies and expert players.I have lots of memories of playing this game with my friend taking turns through each level and building a good defence wall. If you play this game I recommend you play it with a friend you'll have a great time :)
If you like war games and playing with your friends you should buy this.It's a good first person shooter much like arma 2 but a gazzillion times better :P
This game is really boring if you didn't read the tutorial, but really fun if you did.10/10 The money paid is worth it!!!
-people either hate this game or like this game, I for one don-'t like it.-That-'s what I said before I was addicted to this game :P
This game is really worth playing, and its a great multiplayer 9.5/10
