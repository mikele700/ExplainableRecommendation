I really liked the Up You Go achievement!
A beautifully created game that is something everyone will connect to in some way. I know many may not have understood or identified with the themes of faith, but I think there are many other messages to get out of this game then just a relationship with God (even though I am a christian myself). Throughout the story I found it hard to keep back the tears as I remembered family members that I have lost to cancer. The main thing I found amazing was the symbolism and metaphors that filled the game and the way it could draw across emotions and messages. A sensational job from the Green family for creating this game and for sharing their story. Don't miss on this inspiring experience.
Sex seems pretty boring!! :(
