There are very few games that I DON'T regret buying on account of my 'must have compulsion', this is NOT one of 'em! What I look for in a game is things like a clear and intense story line without having to sit through many long video scenes, being able to upgrade items such as weapons and character, great graphics (even better if you have an ATI card in this case), great fluent control of your character. This game has it all. The only downfall I have encountered so far is the few stupid quick time events, which seem to be a growing fad in games.
get it!!
