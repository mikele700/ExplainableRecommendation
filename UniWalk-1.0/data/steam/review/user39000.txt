They really Screwed this game!Made it just like all th others, you wait you wait you wait......Not all games need to be competitive... What happened to playing for FUN? Its simply not as much fun any more.... Who cares about jumping in mid game, auto balence.... Its just for fun.... Sure Keep the the competitive style for the competitive game... but bring back the old style for thos of us that actually just play for fun! When you have 15 minutes to play a game... its NO FUN at all to spend 10 Minutes queueing and then someone leaves because they only had 10 minutes............Who ever did this take over job sux!
