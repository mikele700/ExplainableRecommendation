Gr8 m8 would r8 8/8
Great game! After the first 10 minutes of starting it up I found it very enjoyable. This game has a great horror: action ratio, there are some good jumpscares and also areas where I was able to get into intense firefights with the monsters of the world. The disadvantages to this game are very minimal however there was a moment where I got stuck and had to go back to my last save, there were also moments where the monsters seemed over powered and difficult to complete, however that was towards the end of the game so it gives the player some time to develop their skills with easier monsters. Overall it was a very enjoyable game and I would recomend it to anyone who wants a good story and great action. I would it 9/10.
