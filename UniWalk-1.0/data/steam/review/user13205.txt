So far I-'ve played about, i dont know, maybe 100 hours of Cs:go, and ive enjoyed almost all the time ive spent on it (besides the obvious rage quits). The game may be old, but it packs one hell of a fun train. You-'ll go through the traditional learning stage, and they you will get to the point where you-'ll be like, -Im good at this game!- Its an easy to learn, hard to master type of game, and I like that. I encourage anyone interested in getting Cs:go, to pay the $10 or so dollars, and give it a try. Chances are, you will enjoy it. I hope you found my review helpful. -RoyalNemo
