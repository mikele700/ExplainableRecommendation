It's so realistic it's not funny. But a great game with a very inticing, interactive and immersive story. Honestly, it was worth the time spent on it :D. I don't want to spoil any endings or anything, but that ending... All I can say is, try not to get too attached with your choices, otherwise grab some water beforehand.My first review, but I had to write something about this amazing game; simplistic yet extraordinary.Also, Marc is a tier 1 scrub.
