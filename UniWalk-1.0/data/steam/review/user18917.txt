This game is literally everything I ever dreamed of. You can do anything, anywhere, on any planet, in any world, in any universe, with anyone, anything, and anywhoknowswhat. If you are one of those guys that just loves screwed up stuff, and loves a great laugh, this game is all you ever need. Infinite amounts of weapons, NPC's, Maps, Gamemodes and Vehicles. The ONLY downside to this game, is that whenever you want to join a server, you have to wait for about 20 mins to join.But beside that, by GOD it is a great game, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested!!!-Koopa
