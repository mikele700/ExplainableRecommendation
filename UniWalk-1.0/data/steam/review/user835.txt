this game is really fun, although i should recommend this to VERY good players. it is super challenging to start off cause you will  run in to bandits, dogs, bears and hunger, very often when you start. my advice is to play with friends to make gameplay more easier and fun. but if you have no friends, i will advise you to watch some youtube videos before you start.
This game, apart from some questionable decisions from the tf2 devs, is the most fun I've ever had in a video game
