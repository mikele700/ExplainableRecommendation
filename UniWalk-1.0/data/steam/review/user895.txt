This game is AWESOME yet very challenging.1. i found there was quite a tough learning curve to the combat and working the camera.2. i died like constantly until i got the hang of this and then started to really have fun and made it to the 4th level.i feel quite bad for the game since its had alot of bad reviews that i think it really doesnt deserve.the gameplay is soooo fun beautiful art 5/5 considering buying copies for friends
