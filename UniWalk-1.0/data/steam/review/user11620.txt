idk wtf i was thinking when this dlc came out and i stupidly bought it and i wasnt able to refund it. i regret buying this. not worth a single penny. here's some better stuffGage ninja pack <- has better crossbowYakuza chracter pack <- has the fastest and the strongest melee weapon( plus katanas r kewl)in game masks <- r better especially the new 4 horsemen of  dooms day  whatever  masks if u want some medieval stuff dont buy this bad masks useless weapons with long ♥♥♥ realoads melees weps r useless  and the only good thing is the javelen but nothing beats a motov and or a grenade
 A $60  dollar dlc of Borderlands 2 if u love borderlands 2 and want more play this game if ur new to this game dont buy it buy borderlands 2 is cheeper and bigger.  i finished this game at lvl 27 i finished borderlands 2 at lvl 37  this game is  exactly like a dlc--dlc bundle for borderlands 2
