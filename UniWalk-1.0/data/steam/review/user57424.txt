one of the most - if not the most - beautiful and touching games i have ever played. its brilliant storytelling, unique art style and memorable charecters will undoutably bring you to tears. Definitely recomend this game.10/10
Really enjoying this game so far. Between the cartoony art style and the various gory ways to kill enimies with a chainsaw, this is one of the most enjoyable games i have played in a while. :)
