This game is great, but it is INCREDIBLY HARD... until I realised what to do lol.Amazing game, everyone should play it. The other inmates say things that are HILLARIOUS.
It's a hard (HAH I SAID HARD) game once you start, but once you get over the factor of it being quite hard (HAH I SAID IT AGAIN), it becomes really fun. You'll have multiple rages and at some point I thought I ♥♥♥♥ myself just from dying.8/10 would fap again.
It is fun, but i find that it is hard at the start only because it is hard to fight zombies with your bare fists. So essentially what I am trying to say is, it only becomes fun up until you finally get some stuff in your inventory.
This is a great game.I love how gory and how violent the game is.The only bad thing I can say about this, is it doesn't make it clear how they get the protagonist to commit these crimes.What I also love is how they added an extra feature at the end. I won't say what it is incase people would consider it to be a spoiler.This game is not for the faint of heart and above all CHILDREN.Everyone should play this game when they get the chance.
This is a fun game and has some really great and competitive multiplayer.There is alot of humor put into this game and I think it is plain funny, and overall outrageously fun.
