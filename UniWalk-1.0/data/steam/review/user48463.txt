this game is a disgrace to the sacred name. what have they done?  this game is absolute trash. no loot , no armour pick ups or anykind of weapon pickups. the game is so linear and small its like im playing in world the size of a shoe box.  my heart bleeds for this has ruined a great franchise. R. I. P. sacred
this is another amazing step from telltale games. what a great story about exiled fables. the noir feel to this game and great story make this game a must play. highly recommended. cant wait for tales of the borderlands.
