If you love regency period stories, and you love cards games, then this is a game you will love more than Colin Firth after a dunk in the lake. The artwork is wonderful (and gives you the option of using the backgrounds as your desktop art, bonus!). My biggest beef with card games is that I generally get bored with the same layout every round, but that is not an issue here. Lots of interesting card lays outs that you-' wont get bored of. I don-'t generally get sucked into this type of game, but I found myself saying -Just one more round.. just one more round-. The story line is great and pretty typical of women in regency type story lines (think pride and prejudice). Greatly exceeded my expectations! Great work guys.
