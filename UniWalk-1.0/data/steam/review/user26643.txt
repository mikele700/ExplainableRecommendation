defenitivley one of the best and rythmic strategy games out there, as with most paradox games i've played you can see the effort and time in this game, quite complex but not to an extreamley frustrating level. you will find this game very fun once you get the hang of things.i would recomend this game to any strategy game fan who would like more detail than just go kill take and go again. truly a complete game, with the addition of the S.W. anything is possible. To those who like the renaicanse this is your game of choise
