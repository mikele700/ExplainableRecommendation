ok if your thinking of playing this game don't. To kill you need weapons and to get weapons  you need real money and there is nothing yes i said nothing  in the shop you can buy with in game money.... what's the point.This game sucks from there it could of been better if they had  not put everything in the shop for real money....... i rate this game -10/10
This game is really good to play with 4 friends if your ready to thift stuff
try it
This game is great but sad
what more can i add but saying time too get on my unicorn and shoot nana cats while fighting bosses and players!
This game so far is very fun should get it for fun 4 co-op family night.
