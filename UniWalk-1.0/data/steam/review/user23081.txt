It's fun I must say, but the mountains and depths take quite a bit of time to get used to.Really, other than that, it does strike as fun, but damn, it's easy as hell.So when the game starts and your first village is planted, all you need to do is start making the ground flat around that specific building, until it becomes a castle.Once that is done, wait for those slow ♥♥♥ villagers to build another house, and rinse and repeat. Keep making that ground flat people.I'd say it's worth the 0.69 cents though. For $7?Nyeeshssdnsoaffnoiae... nah not really. Although if you do want to feel good about youself, this game would do justice. Cause you're practically a god (In this game). And why not feel that way, especially after school or a hard day at work. So yes I reccommend this.
It's a nice game. It makes you think.Like the ultimate consequences of your actions as you kill or spare your 'enemies'.It (apparently) makes people cry.Haven't yet met any toxic community members of this game.Sound track is great. Some people say it's mediocre, and I can see why, as the loops of music don't end subtly enough, which is kinda annoying when you realise that the song just repeated. But damn, the music does hit the spot well, as it suits the battle you are currently fighting.What I found bad though, would be the idea of repetitive playing, just to get a different ending. Some people like playing the same game multiple times to get different endings, such as many VNs since the beginning of time. But as for me, I just can't be bothered. But that's it. The bad really only applies to people who don't like to repeat the same thing to get different outcomes. (There are minor changes to the dialogue that make you think, that's what was fueled me to play another playthrough of the game)I still like the game. It's creative. It sparked me and my friend to think about making games. (Not saying this game alone was the tipping point, it just further fueled us to want to make a game.)But yeah, enough about me. I recommend this game. 
*Sees the Trailer and sees Adam Jensen completely decimate everyone**Buys game**Boots Game after ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet connection took 5000 years to download the game**Feels like a boss and instantly jumps into -GIVE ME DEUS EX- difficulty**Dies miserably since there were 500 enemies in my blind spot, and the platform I jumped off was too high (SERIOUSLY, 3m DROPS TAKE OUT HALF HIS HEALTH)*10/10 Would die from trying to take shortcuts by jumping off the balcony of the second floor 
I cry everytime I play this game.Not because I'm sad.But because my eyes are watering from concentrating at the screen for too long.Its very addicting.11/10 would cry again
This game is awesome. no exceptions. the only problem is the fact that the game freezes when you lose all your credits after the game over screen. but still, an awesome game.
The game lags like hell on hardware that surpasses your minimum specs listed. The game throws you into the action without telling you what the heck is going on. One tip... DONT SPAWN PLAYERS RIGHT NEXT TO ENEMIES WHEN THEY BOOT THE GAME UP.
This game.... Is AWESOME! the way that the game immerses you into the action is amazing!
