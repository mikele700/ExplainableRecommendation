Amazing game i loved enemy unkbunown and played it for over 30 hrs and just so you know this game is hard so if you are the type of person who likes easy games this is probably not for you but generally its amazing
♥♥♥♥♥ Awesome Better Launch Than Rome 2 And Also I Get To Scream Lets Get Norse More10/10
Lot's of ways to kill people as The bald agent who has a barcode behind his head, kill everything and everyone or be a silent assassin either way is your choice have fun
RIFT is a great MMORPG and very fun with friends there are lots of positive and negative things about this game and if you have friends like i said before its great and you should totally check this game out and if you don't have friends to play with i suppose you should check it out if you like MMO's so the final verdict for this game is an 8/10 its a great MMO like world of warcraft and also a very solid game but its not a WoW killer but either way the games F2P so why not and get it and try it out anyways
