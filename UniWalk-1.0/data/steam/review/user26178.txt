Simply just awesome a huge improvement over Payday The Heist and Overkill are constantly updating it with new stuff and the soundtrack is just awesome, the only issues I have with this are that the updates are way too big (Which isn't a major issue just something that can be annoying) and that sometimes it can feel a bit too easy but otherwise everything is good definitely worth the $30
