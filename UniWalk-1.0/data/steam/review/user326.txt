A great game however the amount of maps and weapons are quite low compared to L4D2. The graphics and evironment are really well made as well as the sound which coresponse to the gun shots. Be it playing with friends or alone with bots brings never ending thrills. 9/10 Must have if you are a fan of zombie games.
A great massive multi-player game with a very huge workshop base and community market. The game is extremely fun and it is free. Items in the game and many types of gamemodes really brings never ending fun to any player who plays the game. 10/10 one of the best free multi-player games out there. A definate -Must-play-.
Very detailed gameplay with many quests and great storyline. One of the best single/co-op games on steam. Being able to customize and create your own unique character with a skill tree is definately a plus. Overall a 9.5/10. Highly recommended.
It's awesome!
