Let me begin I purchased this game in late 2013 and put up with the sheer amount of DLC's released since then, I bought the Gage Courier Pack, the Gage Sniper Pack and many other DLC's but sometime since then I realised that this game was not worth it.I returned to this game last week and noticed that you can now buy STAT BOOSTING MICROTRANSACTIONS. I still remember back in 2013 that OVERKILL SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT THERE WERE TO BE NO MICROTRANSACTIONS.http://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-wont-have-microtransactions/1100-6410303/I am not surprised at the amount of community backlash that has occured since then. If I could get a refund I would do it.Avoid this garbage, please.
Played the tutorial... and hated it.Looks like a cheap rip off of Counter Strike.The AI seems to sense you when your still on the other side of the map.DON'T BUY THIS GAME...EVER
