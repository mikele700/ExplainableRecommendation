I got this controller for christmas, I have used it for nearly 3 weeks, I can play Dota 2 and CS:GO competitively, and have only ever had to use the curse that is big picture mode when I want to use touch menus or change my configuration. Also it is amazing for games that have controller support already as the trackpads work great as analogue sticks, and the back paddles are set to a and x automatically which will do 80% of your button presses for you. I got this in Australia through ebay and it was missing the extender cable, but luckily a PS3 or 4 cable works fine to connect it to your PC, and USB extenders are everywhere these days.
Played this before steam.It started me on my level 10 shadow hunter.Tried to teach me how to refill my flask.10/10It's school all over again.
