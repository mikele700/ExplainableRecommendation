I've had a pure hatred to any EA game after they got rid of BattleFieldHeroes and honestly you must have this game if you want a good Starwars shooter the EA version has pretty much just got better graphics everything else is worse
Great game if you have spare money and no games you wont #get crates and get crappy items #4 Lord Gabentrust me you will have to have like 2000k to get all the things you want
Finish story mode go to Survival mode find friend play with him add him 10/10  would find again
Found Gun 3 shot a zombie use fist 2 shot to head 10/10 Best logic in the world
