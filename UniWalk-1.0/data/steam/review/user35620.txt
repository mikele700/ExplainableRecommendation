A great and cheap game for when you have a spare moment or two. I was surprised by how addictive and fun this game was and the mechanics really suit the game as a whole. It also has achievements and trading cards which I also enjoy. This game is ideal if you hae some spare Steam funds, or if you need a game to wind down and relax.
