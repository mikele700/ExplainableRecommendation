This game....takes a while to get used to. It can be tricky at times, but I recently got into it when you start to know what to do in the game. Learn the blueprints -> leads to advancing through the game and having a lot of fun. Collect lots of materials and fight those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ aliens. Need to get used to it, but it is $10 worth it. IMO.
