Fun for maybe a week. Thanks to steams new refund policy I no longer have this game and I got my $20 back which I probably ended up wasting anyway
Anyone who likes zombie/apocolypse games. This is the game for you. If you want a FPS that kicks ♥♥♥ as a PVP and vsing AI characters, play this. 9.5/10
