Best game I've ever brought on steam. EVER. and for such a great price (although slightly unoptomized) has tons of awesome features! Buy it now!!!
Great game with a great concept, if was made by anybody else but uber. The game is terribly optimized and everything is streamed from there servers, and that's ok if you have a monster PC and live in a country with good internet speed (not Australia like myself) . If you have these requirements then buy away. The game is great, balanced fun to play, and amazing with the awesome destuctive units
Yeah this game has its ups and downs, but the community will probs never die, proof that a game is not defined by age. Classes, Teams, Robots, Halloween, weapons, Pyro, to many spies, sentry nests, and of course, hats? Look that workshop love it, enjoy the game, it's free and probably better than some of the $60 games on steam! Everybody I present to you Valves Team Fortress 2.
I've played this game alot on my PS2. It was practically my childhood. SO glad I got it on steam, becuase I now have endless replay ability with mods and maps and multiplayer. Thank god there is another one coming out soon. 9/10 Buy it it's totally worth it
Really great game giveing you the freedom to do anything! it can be a building game or a FPS. its really great !!!!
