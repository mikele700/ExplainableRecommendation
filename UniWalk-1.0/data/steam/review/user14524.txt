Fun, is what i best describe the game as. Although from my experience exploration is limited when you travel out all you can find is  1 chest of gold and a merchant that gives you a good randomize deal on items. If this game provided more rewards for exploration it would be more interesting instead of only heading out to recruit and meet the merchant. watching the camp you have grow into a stronghold is very pleasing to witness and the hoard of enemies on red nights are somewhat challenging if you haven't invested enough time and gold into defence. I would recommend this game for its ability to challenge patience and choices to determine how many days you can last against the hoards of enemies every most nights. 1 last thing to note is that i can't seem to select the sex of my character and it is randomly generated everytime i restart. Maybe this minor feature could be improved on? but other than that it's an enjoyable game.
