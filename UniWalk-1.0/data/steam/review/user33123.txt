this game is total crap. it might change after early access but atm theres next to no gameplay, the movement is very rough(i got a rift but theres no way id play this with it i would be puking  in a few seconds thats how bad the movement feels) and really this shouldnt even be on sale in the state its in(i know early access games are not finished but this is taking that to the next level)
Its like walking up a mountain with someone constantly kicking you back downthe first few days of this you will want to ragequit and never come back but if you survive and actually start to make progress you will see that this game is really awesome and well worth its price
finally got around to playing thisgame looks awesome  and although the story starts slow it is not too bad looking forward to act 2 the only thing i could complain about is it is a little short and easy but those are not always negatives
storys solid and the linux port runs beautifullythe games a little easy though i played it on tough and had no real challenge so id recomend playing it on hardcore
Totally impossible to play...but thats what makes it kinda fun
Pirateships battleing in the skyyou know you want it :)
