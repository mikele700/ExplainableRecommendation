So I'm about 4 hours into this, haven't even really pushed much of the story and I have to say this game right here is the game that despite the combat system and it playing like a classic Final Fantasy game (might not be the best analogy I could use...don't judge me I come from the shooter and racing genre I didn't play a lot of game with wait your turn combat lol) but despite the play style it is and me hating wait your turn combat I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. I feel like I'm in an episode of South Park and it's just great all around.
Best trucking simulator I've ever played. I love this game, if you like long drives and realistic driving physics for what today's tech can provide then this is the game for you :D
Very fun game, and for the price I paid for it I am getting well above my money's worth from it. I also love the fact it has full controller support something that you just don't see enough of in games on PC these days, some games were just made to work better with a controller than a keyboard and mouse. The game all around has catchy music that doesn't get annoying after hearing it for the 30th time and it progressively get's more complicated to play but it doesn't go from being super easy to super hard you have a middle ground which is something else I've seen lacking in most cooking simulation games. All in all I give this game an 8 out of 10. And for the price who can really complain about it.
