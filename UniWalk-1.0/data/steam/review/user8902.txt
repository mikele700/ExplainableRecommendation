Well dayz if there is one thing to know about dayz is that if you have -my leg is painful- or something along those lines dont go up ACT or Firestation stairs and dont run out door ways their my 2 most helpful tips and number 3 is dont rage when your shot beacause 85% of the time every one KOS so yea.Things needed 1. More guns not 100 pistols 2. Vehicles 3. Better hacking/exploiting protection4. Heroes and Bandit skins5. Being able to grow moostaches Over all dayz is a good game for $30 even if it does need alot more.9/10 would bang
