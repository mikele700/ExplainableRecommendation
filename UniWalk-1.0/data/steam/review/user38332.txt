This game is awesome.....Now that it is free you should have no problems playing......
An extremely fun game with hints of a 'Call of Duty' play-style  and 'Team Fortress 2' wackiness. The balance of the two styles makes the game unique, giving the feel of a competitive game that doesn't take itself seriously. I recommend this game to any lovers of First Person shooters, however this game does come with it's fair share of issues.-The Matchmaking issues are present making it seem as if there aren't any players online. (As I am in Australia, I had to change my  Steam 'Download region' to US Chicago to have any hopes of playing.)-A seeming lack of dedicated servers seem present as the game, most of the time, assigns a 'Host' for the matches making gameplay very laggy at times.This aside, Gotham City Impostors is still a very solid game that needs an equally solid community to keep it alive.I still, however, recommend this game.
One of the best online games of all time!!.....The OG of Modern Warfare....A must get for first person shooter fanatics....
The Game that started it all.....Get it for nostalgia sake....
Unleash your artistic potential.....Seriously......It's Annoying......
