I've been waiting to have at least a month of playtime to write a review, but since day one you have pretty much everything you could expect from a game of this genre topped. I'm not a veteran of this kind of game by any means, only played Diablo 1, and not even a fan. With this game, it's a complete different story. Everything that went wrong with Diablo 1 that I can call out myself and Diablo 2 & 3 by others - as it's a constant comparison with the now ex-king of the genre - is made right in Path of Exile. It's even considered by some its rightful successor: what was expected from the latest Diablo title and just came out short. As Team Fortress 2 draws people from many likings into a first-person shooter, PoE has players who are not even that into RPG's, but there's something that lures them in: the lore, the scenery, the loot system... Something. Aside from the latency drawback, it's a game that has much to give to the hardcore players as to the casual ones. It's made by an indie company that actively hears their player base and deploys frequent content updates and fixes. Still not enough reasons to try it out? It's free to play, damn it!
