Most fun i have had in years and i hope to see more from Galaxytrail in the future. this game rocks
after playing this game since it's release and i must say i am highly liking DBXV it has a good feel and game play for a DBZ game and the new take on old stories are some what fun , the class system is good and sticks to races we have seen from the DBZ universe and it makes me feel like i am now part of the lore of the DragonBall universe and i am only half way into the game so would i say pick up this game? my answer is yes, for this is the best DragonBall game i have ever played and if you are into DB DBZ then i say give it a try
