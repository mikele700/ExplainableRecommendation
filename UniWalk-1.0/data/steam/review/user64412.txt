Realy Fun and involves stratergy un like COD where you run in and noscope every one but you team because there is no friendly fire, in CSGO your team has to plant the bomb or save the hostages and in competative friendly fire is on which means you have to pay atention to every thing so you dont kill your team mates. You also have to manage your income because if you and your team are doing realy bad you may not be able to aford a gun. The knifes are sooo expensive even though you use your primary and secondary wepons more, someknifes are worth $2,000 which ridiculas and if some one buys that insted of a good pc than there plain stupid. With out a doubt a realy realy fun game and so satisfying when you get a kill.Game reveiw by Jack(Silver_Ray)
