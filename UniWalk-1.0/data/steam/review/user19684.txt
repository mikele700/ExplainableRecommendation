Being a huge total war fan I was a bit annoyed when I heard that the franchise wasn't sticking to it's historical base. However after deciding to give the game a go I'm shocked to admit that this is the funnest total war I have played for years. The combat system is fluid and  units fight in a much better  more fluid fashion, the campaign AI is much improved and will attack you when you are weak, and pay tributes and seak peace if a horde of vampries starts to swarm through their lands. New hero system rocks, also the ability to rename units and characters enhanced by the customizable classes and 'loot' system enables  the 'RPG' element recent total wars have been missing. fantastic game, also had no launching or graphics issues- runs better than attila for me@!
