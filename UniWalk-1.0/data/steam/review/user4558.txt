Pretty damn awesome, whats not to love? Killing aliens, dubstep guns, awesome cars, super powers. the Fun is forever! Until your GTX 960 doesn't work with the game.
What is Robocraft?Robocraft is a game where you may build nearly anything you can think of, the concept is very unique the early execution was precise, one of the biggest attracting components to the game is that the building is similiar to the popular survival game -Minecraft- while this sounds all good and dandy! There are MANY fatal flaws with this game. Don-'t get me wrong this is a fun game, but the developers are favouring more to the newbies and ignoring what really needs to be done to keep the game in a good shape:Pros:1. F2P2. very small (storage wise EG MBs and GBs)3. LOADS of items to obtain.Cons:1. Inapropriate bots (Swastikas, Genitals, Offensive language)2. Developers rarely care about people who have played for long times,3. Developers don-'t create backups/images of robots incase a fatal error happens4. Developers constantly change the way the game works,5. Developers try to make you spend money on the game so that you can paint your robots.6. people using languages other than the specified one in chat.7. VERY REPETITIVE.Overall the game used to be incredibly fun, but then they added things like aerorods, flak cannons etc.I used to rate this game 10/10 but now the game would be lucky to be even a 0.25/10 from me,waste your life on a different game, this game is not worth the time you would spend grinding constantly
I absolutely love this story!the characters are very well thought out, the story is very intruiging (Can-'t wait for chapter 4!) and i just completely enjoy this! sale was a money saver for me!If you love Anthros and are not worried about -wasting- time get this!10/10 ~Xenolf
Just amazing as hell. feels like i own NASA :D
