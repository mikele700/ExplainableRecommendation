A Great game, i highly recommend this to anyone who like the tactial style FPS games. This game will infuriate you, but for some reason you wont be able to stop playing it.If you like Team based games then this is the game for you, cooperation is needed to proceed with capturing trenches and repelling enemy attacks. With great graphics and a mostly awesome community you cannot go wrong with the money you spend on this game. ALthjough i do feel that gun unlocking/purchasing (with ingame points, not real cash) could be changed and possibly more information on the game itself could be supplied within the game such as tutorials and more explanation on how the unlocking process works.
