Oh, Talisman. I forgot what a broken lie your AI dice rolls are.-I-'ve found a wand! Huzzah!-Elf rolls exact number to land on your square and attacks.You roll 1. Elf rolls 2.Use a fate token! YOU STILL ROLL ONE, EVERY DAMN TIME.Elf takes wand.Repeat this process until the wizard inevitably wins.I know this has been discussed before, but the rampant ferocity with which AI controlled characters manage to make exactly the right roll they need to do absolutely anything is bent.Only get this if you really liked playing talisman with your human friends and intend to do so online. Don-'t play AI.
A thoughtful meditation on isolation and the complexity of real world relationships. I've never played a hiking sim with such a deep and rich plot before.The simplicity of gameplay is deceptive - the true value of this game lies in the varied experiences of players in how they tackle the game and the conversations it throws at you with Delilah, the lookout coordinator in Thorofare tower and ostensibly your only contact in the world. Finish it, talk about it with your friends, let it sink in and think a bit, then come back and play it again in a few months.V. rewarding.
At first I thought this game was messing with me in clever but slightly predictable ways. Like a choose your own adventure.Then it really started ♥♥♥♥ing with me. Excellent.
Kickarse shoot 'n loot fun. If you liked BL1, BL2 improves on it in just about every way.
