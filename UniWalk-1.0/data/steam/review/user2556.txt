Got this as a gift. Even though i love old games, this one just bored me. I'd only recommend it for people who feel like playing something that looks like FFVII. Even then, i'd recommend just playing FFVII. btw unless you use winXP prepare to sell your soul to Satan just so it can run. 10/10 would play again.
