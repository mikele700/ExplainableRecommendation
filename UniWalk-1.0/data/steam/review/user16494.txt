If you're a big ww2 fan then you should check out this game. It has many cool weapons and vehicles such as tanks, planes, smgs, lmgs, rifles. But in order to get them you must work hard for it (grinding). This game also requires some skill when you need to compesate for the bullet drop at long distances especially if you're going sniper. Normally nowadays, the snipers are very op in the game since it has 1 hit kill. i've had around 200hours in this game because i'm a big fan of ww2 and when you first play this game, you are going to die a LOT, so my advice is that you should just continue to play eventually it'll start to get real fun and you'll have a great time. I reckon why a lot of people dislikes this game is because right after they got it, they rage quit too easily since they don't have any good weapons but they haven't experienced what its like to actually own those weapons since it takes too long to get them. But in the end i reckon it was all worth the effort.Overall this game is recommended to all yous out there who is either a big fan of ww2, likes to grind for hours or basically whoever likes a challenge.
