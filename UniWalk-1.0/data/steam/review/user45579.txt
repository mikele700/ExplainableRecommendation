11/10 Most amazing game I've ever played. The sound track is phenomenaland is the cherry on the cake for an incredibly deep story that envokes a strong sense of empathy and makes you feel very attached to the characters not to mention the stunning graphics every scene looks like an artwork. I would recommend this game to anyone that appreciates a good story, the art of game making, a great sound track and quality story line.
