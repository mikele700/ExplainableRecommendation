 After completeing all the levels with the main protagonist, here is my review. 8.5/10 The games random elements keep thing interesting, but I find myself cysling through the rng untill I find one that is a little easier. It does help the game stay fresh when you are repeating a level generally several times.The difficulty starts relatively high and only continues for the most part as the game progresses.If you find the first level frustratingly difficult and have played less than 2 hours, consider gettign a refund as it only gets harder.Level design is wonderful with enough variety that even though the game never changes its machanics it doesn't get boring. With the difficulty so high you genuinally feel a sense of achievement when a level is completed.The artstyle while simple is brilliant as is the sound design. I just wish there was a fast reset button.Overall it is the first game in a long time I have completed, one that has challenged me but not to the point of giving up.I give a solid 8.5/10. Now to continue with the unlockable charactures
