Edit : i've played rust for 17 hr with INTEL HD! What a crap! thas why i get bad FPS. When i use my GTX 850M Booom 50 fps! Here's my Laptop specs : Intel Core i7 2.5 Ghz~2.5 GhzNvidia GTX 850m 4 gb16 gb of RAMIT WORKS FLAWLESSLY, I would recommend to buy this!#NOTICE : If you cant handle low FPS do not play.The optimization of Rust still in bad condition. Although I played with 10-18 fps (Low Settings), I really enjoyed it.Your instinct of survival will help you in this game.Day 1 : Naked with a rock and a torch. Stranded and dont know what to do. I met people who sleep everywhere naked, i killed them with rocks and loot them.Day 2 : Meet a friend and build a base near a gigantic base which  one of his foundation i stole. fortified and manage things in there.Day 3 : Hunting for animals and airdrop. Almost died tho because off traps.Day 4 :  Knowing our neighbours is our rivals, we relocate asap from there before we get raided. We move to Icy mountain. Well, i wrote little cause im lazy. For me its worthed.
I'm a simple man.I see wall.I broke the wal.
I must say this game is a good F2P one.Graphic good, gameplay is great too and balanced. No money needed to buy things ( but grinding is needed for awhile)
They didnt tell me this game is addictive..
WHY THE HELL I HAVENT BOUGHT THIS GAME FROM THE BEGINING.Car making love with football and there you go Rocket league was born..
You see, i played first 5 games, and i already killed more than 5 teammates. This game is extremely tactical. Every bullet is really precious here. i recommend you to buy this game. It is kinda casual game but really tense. I love this game!
