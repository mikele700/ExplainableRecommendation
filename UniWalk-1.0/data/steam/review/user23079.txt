Konohamaru's Ultimate Justu...10/10
Hello, first time writing a review so here goes.This game is simply great. Of course it's not everyone's game, we all know that and should respect that.I've only had it for a short while and every time I play I don't stop until about 9 hours later. I will say it's much better with someone you know. The Avatar Conquest mode is really fun too even when the other guy has elite troops. There's still a chance, a chance that you might win. It's all about learning the game.The campaign is awesome, so much to learn and it's always changing, keeping you on your toes.Well, I guess that's it so go buy it!
♥♥♥♥♥ AND GIGGLES!!!
