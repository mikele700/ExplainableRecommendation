This documentary is much, much more helpful as an insight of the minds of professional dota players than anything that has come before it. Every single player featured (HyHy, FEAR and Dendi) devoted their time, made sacrafices and worked hard to achieve their ultimate (press R) goals. Especially touching is the clip of fishing at the end. I need not say more should you have already seen this.
Pretty meh, if you enjoy watching water go down a plughole, this is your game.
Very good RPG, graphics are good, yet can be toned down to run on older computers. Well worth the price tag. Enormous mod community means it still has flavour.
This is really well done.Has an exceedingly high learning curve, you will be told you are bad repeatedly, but is quite, quite fun.Do not play if you tend to get addicted to games. Also do not play if you like opening crates. This game has crates.
An incredibly fun roguelike, fun, intense but not stressful at the same time.
