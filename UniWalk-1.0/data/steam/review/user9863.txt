Awesome game, but if anyone else had texture issues with any of the doom games you just need to update the DOSbox included with the game.

At the begining of rust experimental, it was not quite the game it was before. But now, I think it has already become much better than the older version of rust. I think PVP is still a little better in legacy but apart from that it truly is a better game than the original.
