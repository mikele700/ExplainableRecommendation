with out a doubt that this is the worst game ive ever played sean murry is a liar.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
one of the best games i've ever played. evolve is a game where its monster vs 4 hunters on different maps and game modes. this is probly one of the fist games i've ever played were all the classes are good and fun to play. it is worth the buy and is really fun.
