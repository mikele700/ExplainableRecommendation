This game deserves a big following. Brings back a lot of memories, while bringing in a new, innovative gameplay. It's hard for the first few times, trying to get your head around it, but definitely worth the perseverance. So much fun to play. The array of weapons is ample, and relatively balanced - if you think a weapon sucks, you're bound to meet someone who knows how to really use it. Maps are crazy and interesting. The community that's growing seems very friendly, and I think the small size of games (four players max) helps this.Blunderbuss/10
