Portal 2 is a fun and interactive game that challenges you to think outside the box. Obviously, it-'s the sequal to the original Portal so graphics and UI have been increased significantly. You play as a -test subject- for -'Aperture Laboratories-' where they test the potential of beings for the future. On the journey you go through many tests set by GLaDOs (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) while observing the environment trying to find a way out of the facility. Overall it is a great game for anyone looking for a puzzling journey full of surprises.
