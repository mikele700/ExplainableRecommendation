The gameplay and mechanics of the game a great but the perfortmance is utterly laughable for a game running UE3.For a AAA release this sort of performance issues along with a $40 season pass is terrible.Do not recommend
3 of Britons Longbowman Armies and your done for the game.10/10 wood please
This is a great game and if you do not own it yet you should heavily consider picking Civ 5 up.Strongly recommmeded for edless hour and replayability.What are you waiting for?
