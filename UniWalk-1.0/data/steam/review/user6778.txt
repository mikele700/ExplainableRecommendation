This is a very intense and yet enjoyable game. The soundtrack is probably my favourite game soundtrack I've ever heard. The heists are exhilirating and fun. The level desgin can be a bit lazy at times but the little details really make this game a great experience. Remember, GET ON THE ♥♥♥♥ING GROUND!

This game is so fun! It has a big open world map, loads of weapons and cars, and an alright storyline. If you like to stuff around and attach people to props, this game is for you.
I still prefer CS:S over CS:GO but this game is still amazing. With lots of improvements its a great CS game. The gameplay is amazing, the graphics and the game is just greatI totally recommend this game to any person who play shooters.
