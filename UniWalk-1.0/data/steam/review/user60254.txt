10/10 Most competetive FPS game ever made. As the name Counter-Strike it pays to its homage. Having the same controls based on the Counter-Strike mod for Half-Life its gameplay still remains faithful but with a boost with the latest engine and modernization of some guns. Compared to other games that require an unfair leveling system, this game forces players to make critical decisions, work as a team, improve on dexterity, polish hand-eye coordination.Hint: Be a sport, If you win it is because of the team's effort, if you lose they're just better than you(Unless the legitly cheat).
Fez has the nostalgic feeling of 2D platformer games and has the complexity of puzzle games. You navigate through obstacles by changing the angle of your perception when at times things are impossible to reach at one angle become available in the other. At times the game will be a bit confusing, tiring and frustrating but that is the test of puzzle games for you.Though this game might not be for some, it is still an enjoyable game in its own. Having its originality in its concept and application it is commendable that it is one of those unique games that will be remembered.
Planetside 2 is the best Free 2 Play Game ever. Unlike other F2P games that makes ridiculous difference if you purchase in game items or not, this game maintains the enjoyable gameplay you would normally find in P2P games. Would defenitely recommend this game hands down.
