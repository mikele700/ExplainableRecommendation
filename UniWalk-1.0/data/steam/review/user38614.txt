This game is amazing. I've played so many levels it's crazy, and I'm not even halfway to completing all of them. I've played 62 hours, more than most AAA games I own, and CW is far more fun than them too. Highly recommended.
In it-'s current state, JC3 is broken. Driver crashes keep me from ever entering the actual world. Well done Avalanche. But from my -19 minutes played- in the menu screen, it-'s not great. An unskippable 30 wait till...a DRM/online login which takes 15s. Then a loading screen for another 30s...all to take me back to the very first screen I saw, but now with an option to start the game. So it-'s taken 2 minutes before I was able to get to the main menu. Disgraceful.On top of that, some of the keybindings in the GUI tab are unchangeable, which is ♥♥♥♥ing useless considering I-'m left handed and need to change the bindings to play properly.In short, a myriad of unskippable waits, driver crashes, poor interface design and DRM make this game totally unplayable. I expected better Avalanche.
