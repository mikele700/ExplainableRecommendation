This, is by far way more enjoyable than most other first person shooters that are out there currently, by my standards atleast.Sadly, i originally downloaded this game because i saw STAR_ play it, and i thought it looked pretty decent. I played this game for around half an hour and immediatly fell in love with it. The mechanics are great, they feel so smooth and so right. Even though it does take a while to play through games and get points to buy other guns, it dosn't matter, the starting loadout is perfect, for learning the mechanics and slaugtering people. And when you do finally earn enough points (or GP) to buy your first gun it's so pleasing. I was getting wrecked for so long, but then i figured out how to use the HRV which lets you see through walls, and then i finally picked up my game and started to enjoy the game a lot more, just the simple easy things like that change it a lot. I don't have that many hours on Blacklight: Retribution, but, it's one of the best games i have ever encountered on steam.And best of all, it's free!
