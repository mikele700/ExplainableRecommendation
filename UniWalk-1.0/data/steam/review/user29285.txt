I grew up with this game, as my brother an I pretty much stole the game off of my unsespecting step dad after he bought it on the release date. I ended up playing it alot back then (on the average computer in the back room). Once I grew older I made myself a personal steam account, this then lead to me buying Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (probably during a cheap as f**k sale). Anyway, I ended up playing through the campaign again (to familiarise the story) and I decided I would play some Multiplayer. This, this was amazing for me considering I had loved this game so much as a child. The leveling up and unlock sytem was amazing for me.For some reason I have loved this game so much, I guess it was the first PC FPS Shooter I really enjoyed. If you are wondering I have over 400 hours on the multiplayer part of this game.If this game is on special (as it probably will be) for a reasonable price i think you should pick it up. I and many others love this game so maybe you will to, who knows right?Cheers for reading this.
