If you love space and sci-fi this game is a must have, exploration in this game is my favourite part as discovering rare planets and flying up close to them looks imensly cool. Another thing about this game that is somewhat overlooked is the phenomenal sound design and varied music that transitions flawlessly to what ever situation you find your self in. Overall very good can't wait to see where they take it next.
