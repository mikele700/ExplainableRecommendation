This game is filled with smurfs and hackers dont even bother.
10/10 another amazing Tom Clancy game :) the stealth aspect is easy to learn and fun to use, reulting in a good gaming experience....However, using a silenced sniper does make the game alot easier, so if you want a challenge then use another gun than the sniper ;)
REALY BAD GAME IN GENERAL..... Gearbox say its -our choice- in how we play the game...but then they nurf drop rates and guns we enjoy using. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! the season pass is a rip off as well. Stick with Borderlands 2 . DO NOT BUY THIS GAME I fell sorry for whever pre-orderd this game because you only got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dlc worth $5  
Nice story game, with amazing graphics!! 9/10
Very epic game. even better with razer game booster. 9.5/10
Very Hard and Annoying! but fun game :)
Just like minecraft
