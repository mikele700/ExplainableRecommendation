Bloody terrible. Don't get it. It's outdated and gets boring very quickly. If you're even thinking about it - stop. Take it from me, I generally love these sort of strategy games; but this one's the scum of strategy. If I could give it a star rating, it would get 1 out of 10 if I was in a good mood. There are so many bugs it's just painful to play.
