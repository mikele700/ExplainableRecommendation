This game...nothing else to say other than I'm blown away by the amazing amount of talent shown by the developer. That is correct, one man did everything. Art, music, game play, everything, and it shows. But in a way that speaks on a very personal level.Armed with Wings: Rearmed takes me back to the old days of trawling Newgrounds for the next bite of entertainment to while away those 'computer education' classes back in high school. It's an undiluted experience that doesn't hold your hand, giving a steadily increasing challange that while initially frustrating, pushes you to learn its nuances.I wont go into much game play detail as I feel this will ruin the experience, suffice to say it's a side-scrolling, combo driven slasher with the occasional puzzle thrown in for good measure. Oh and an upgrade system which only served to make me play more, I need that next sword!Three thumbs up mate, cheers for the chat at PAXAUS 2015, I was the guy you asked if I was a developer and the answer was no. However you've definitely inspired me to pick up the board of keys and see what I can do.
