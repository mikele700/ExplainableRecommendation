bad bad bad first impression. when u start castle crashers, the give you a big notice -we recommend playing with a controller-. what they really meant was -this game cant be played with a keyboard without getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off-. all tips in-game are given in the xbox controller key presses. and if you-'re using a key board you have to stop, reread your settings and go -oooooh.- its annoying. the gameplay itself seemed average, like any other beat-em-up game. honestly i can play this ♥♥♥♥ on a flash game website and not tell the difference. unresponsive controls. uninspired gameplay. not optimised for keyboard. the behemoth knows how to make average-ish games. but they cant port it to other platforms to save their mothers life. 6/10 game, 3/10 for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ half-♥♥♥♥ port job. no idea why its -overwhelmingly positive-.
