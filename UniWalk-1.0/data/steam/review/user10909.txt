I've played 2 hours so far, and I haven't seen any form of life, I've built the house plus a ring of defensive walls and have been living off chocolate bars I find in suitcases scattered around the beach where I have taken refuge. I haven't yet seen a living NPC, which I hope changes soon because without the NPC's the game isn't as fun as it sounds. Other than that small issue the game works quite well for an early access game.
