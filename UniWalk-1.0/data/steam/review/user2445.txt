Played this game in roblox, the prototype version. It hits 1 million visits less than 1-3 months. And I highly reccomend to people who is new to zombie survival.
A amazing game, for starters who loves. MMORPG you can fight monsters,zombies,wolves AND MORE. Lots of fun bosses such as Jelly king and cool game that you can customize  your knights to be a gunner, warrior and a knight you can add accessory to. Fun game give it a try.
