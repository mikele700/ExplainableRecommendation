i never want to stop playing
I REALLY like the fable series, except for 3 lol. the first fable game is probably one of the best RPG games I have ever played and to see it remastered like this is awesome. I just wish they would add Fable 2 to PC :c

This a pretty good game to just relax and just play by yourself
