Wanted more games that functioned like mount and blade and also something that could give me a modern sid meiers pirates feel, so im glad this came around. Buggy for now but looking forward to its updates and completion :) also hope theres a way to get the soundtrack for this, that menu music is amazing!!!! Keep going and create an amazing game :)
This game is one of the best games ive played, it is fun and the mechanics i absolutely love. But until the bugs are fixed and the game is actually playable this game deserves no new players. Absolutely outrageuos that i cant play a single player match without the game crashing either instantly or a few turns in and in multiplayer i can never host or the same thing happens, many people have this problem and have had it for years, this game is complete trash and not worth a single cent until the developers get off their asses and give a ♥♥♥♥ about the community enough to fix game breaking problems before shipping out a new broken game in the series.
