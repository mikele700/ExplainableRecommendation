Game really is fun and has a lot of potential to being one of the best zombie survival games but at the moment it has some downfalls. Desync is one of the major problems you can have in this game, not to mention if you end up running through a building, up the stairs and all of a sudden drop dead on the second stair case. Zombies tend to one hit you and ruin most of the gear you have on you (Pain in the ♥♥♥ to find the stuff again). Standing still then all of a sudden hear friends laughing at you because they saw your character walk directly off the edge of the rooftop you were on. But wait, i'm still standing on the roof? Oh wait, no, there's the death screen. Theeerrree it is. Some really deadly terrain, most of my deaths and rage come from just climbing a ♥♥♥♥ing ladder, and i have a good connection. But honestly, like i said, the game has a lot of potential and there's a lot of pluses besides the aggravating zombies and the deadly staircases your tempted to climb up to find loot. And other places but anyway, it's nice to play with friends, roam around, get geared and meet some people along the way whom you'll have to decide to make friend or foe. Give it a try. Hopefully you'll have better chance than me XD 7/10
Love the game, Fun and enjoyable. Don't knock it till you try it!
