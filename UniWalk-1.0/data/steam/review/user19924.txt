This is a quick intro for those who want to get into the franchise but actually haven-'t played a souls game. I know I needed this when I started.The good:-You can build a character around a variety of archetypes, want to be a reaper complete with scythe and dark magic? What about a shield and spear hoplite? Maybe you feel like beating people to death with an anvil-on-a-stick while wearing stone armour. You can. -Fighting isn-'t just swapping out weapons with different numbers, you get invested in your gear. You-'ve chosen to be a reaper? Well you-'d better learn how to reap with that build. No matter your setup you will learn to use it and you will have to behave differently for each. No more -New weapon, I-'ll just hit bad guys until they die. Now I-'m bored with this weapon-. -When you-'re on fire it feels like being Neo dodging bullets without the slow mo. It could all come crashing down in an instant but for a while you-'re untouchable.The bad:-Not holding your hand is a selling point but when you don-'t have a clue about certain game mechanics you-'re pretty much boned unless you find a guide. Read up on effigies, game progress routes and the Emerald Herald.--It-'s a game that too often sacrifices fun, replaces it with tedium, and tries to defend that choice by calling it a challenge- I-'m not proud of quoting gamespot but this was always stuck in my mind. As newcomer, aggroing one enemy at a time, cheeseballing, and even waiting for hp to regen before moving on (I know, I know, but gotta hoard effigies) seemed to be the only way to play. All to avoid having to repeat a section, lose my souls and lose precious max hp.The ugly:-Tongue but holeSumming up, you will have to be persistant. If you can accept that it might take a few dozen deaths to clear an area and let your rage go then it-'s a rewarding game.
