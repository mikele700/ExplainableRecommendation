Blood Bowl 2 is a very fun but RNG heavy strategy game. Since all decisions are made through simulated dice rolls, it can be as merciless as any wargame/tabletop.That being said; if you can stomach a sometimes clunky interface and the notion that sometimes you just WON'T win some matches due to dice rolling, Blood Bowl 2 is a great game. There is something incredibly satisfying when you knock down an enemy player's unit and injure or kill them.
