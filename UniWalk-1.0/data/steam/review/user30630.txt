When my friends ask me what a slig is, I will say oh it-'s one of the bad guys from the Abe series. About 20% of them wil say: 'oh those old games from the 90-'s- but the rest will go -what-'s abe- then i-'ll have to say, look it up on steam. Abe was te very first game i ever played on my original playstation, back then though i could barely hold a contoller without dropping it, and i could still recognise this games fun potential. I believe just because a game is old and wasn-'t to popular when it first came out, isn-'t a  valid reason for a great puzzle platformer to fly under the radar. Abes Exodus, and Abes Odysee have an excellent backstory and lore, which come hand in hand with great, oldschool gameplay that gamers young and old can enjoy.-The Angry Slig
