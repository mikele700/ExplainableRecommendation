Team Fortress 2 is a very good game, with constant updates and content being created and provided by both players and Valve teams. An incredible amount of weapons is given to players, that can also equip a vast array of hats to their loadouts. The game has many gamemodes that are both challeging, such as MvM (Mann vs. Machine), a new gamemode that puts up to 6 players in a desperate attempt of defending the objective from an army of robots, and entertaining, such as Payload, which consists of one team pushing a bomb through the tracks, while the other team must defend the main objective, subsequently, preventing the bomb from reaching it's final destination. All I can say is Team Fortress 2 is the best F2P experience you'll find in Steam!
