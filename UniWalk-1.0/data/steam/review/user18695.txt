Very good and high quality for early access. But just need 3 main things fixed:Food/hunger systemLagBugy dinosFix them and it would be near perfect
Um, its alright, but would not have payed any money for it if you had to.

I Found It Fun And Boring At Different Parts
This Is An Awesomie Game Buy It, Buy It, Buy It
Garry's Mod Is One Of My Favourite Games, With Lots Of Things To Do In Just Sandbox Alone, There Is Also Lots Of Custom Content Like : Dark RP, TTT And Flood With I Really Enjoy. Defently Worth $9.99
For someone that really enjoyed source, this game is basically a better version of source. Very impressive game.
