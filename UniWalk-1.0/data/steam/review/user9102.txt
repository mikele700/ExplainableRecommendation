Absolutely am disheartened to see my favourite game in cohort with Steam's utterly dissapointing plan. This review isn't related to the game design but rather the end experience. To see such a manipulation is very dissapointing.However, I must praise the community for being so vocal and remaining in solidarity with what has struck upon. Thank you, modders and those that share their voices. Let us be heard.
