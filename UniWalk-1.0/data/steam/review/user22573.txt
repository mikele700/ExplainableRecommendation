Darkest Dungeon is a game with alot of unique factors that must be considered to do well. It has a variety of class options and trinkets to suit playstyles to fit a wide range of players. The game does however rely heavily on random number generations which can be slightly annoying if the rolls are not in your favour but this adds to the randomness of the game where your entire estate could collapse from one mission. It is a good early acesss game and i would strongy recommend picking this up.
Binding of Issac shows a great variety of items and bosses as well as regular enemies, which is enchanced by the Wrath Of The Lamb DLC, giving great reason to play again and again. The game gives a goal followed by a harder goal in terms of achievements and bosses. The defult challenge runs by the game gives a great change to the style of gameplay as well with mods that can create custom made challenge runs. Giving the player amazing items to play in different styles and even becoming extremely strong through multiple items such as becoming Guppy or having a great combo of items almost securing victory and giving items such as rerolls makes for a great chance to beat the pretty challenging game!(Ive only done this review as the new Rebirth is coming out)Amazing game i would recommend as it is cheap and the DLC is like a whole new game!
