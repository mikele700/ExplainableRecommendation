One of the best FPS competetive games i hae played so far with a widespread community and many players its easy to find many friends along the way if you are just browsing community servers or bored in a game of casual! Playing on the competetive global servers have even made me learn a few thngs and helped me in my grades ; i was studying Russian at school for my test when i started playing cs:go, i learnt russian after weeks of playing cometetive! Very helpful for studying!
