To those who made this game possible, I thank you.  I loved this book when I was growing up. Pros: + Kept true to the original paper book+ Beautifully done graphica and animation+ I can't fault the playability.   I just know I'm going to be playing this through several times.  :) Cons: - There aren't anymore of these yet (that I know of at the time of writing this)- The only other con is that I can't sing the praises of this game loud enough to do it justice.  :P Best $13AUD I've spent.  Highly recommended and I can't wait to purchase future games based on the other Ian Livingstone / Steve Jackson books.   I eagerly await them!
Wonderful game all round!  I deliberately dragged my play through out to 7hours as I didn't want it to end.  That's how much I enjoyed it.  If you have a chance to get this game, do.  Well worth it.      10/10 for this game. The only negative, IF you can call it a negative, is that it's just not long enough.   :P Hope they make (with the same lovely graphics) a sequel for it.
