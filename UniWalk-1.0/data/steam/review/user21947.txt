Amazing depth and complexity that you just don't see today. So much content available if you take the time to look.
Bit of a mixed bag, really.The atmosphere and feel of the game are great. If you felt that Pioneer was a bit too realistic, this is the game for you. Unfortunately, the game is plagued with bugs and updates have been infrequent (though I may be proven wrong in the near future) I have personally been enjoying it, though.
Requires patience and dedication but is extremely rewarding
The greatest open world game I have ever played. Excellent gameplay and fantastic characters and story as well as an amazing dynamic world.
A rip-roaring adventure with a fantastic story and amazing gameplay. An absolute must-have.
Such fun, either sneaking above soldiers, silently slitting their throats or blasting your way through with supernatural powers, Dishonored is a bundle of fun from start to finish
