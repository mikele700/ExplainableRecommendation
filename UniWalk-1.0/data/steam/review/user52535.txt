Well this is one of the actual survival games out there. The game is very fun to play, there is a lot to explore.8/10
This game is awesome, Nice graphics. It's one of the best stealth action games I have played. You can complete a mission in many different ways, choose different paths to get to your objective.There's also magics like slow time , blink  etc which will help you alot. Great game overall 9/10
Its hilarious to see all those slo-mo shots this game is awesome
I love this game soo much! The combat system is soo good. 10--10
