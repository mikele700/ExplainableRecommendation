Castle Crashers is fun game to play with friends, but alone you can only enjoy for so long.
Holy ♥♥♥♥ this game is the most fun I've had since the crucification of Jesus Christ
Ths game needs a offline pratice mode where you can freely choose mercs to try them before you buy them and of course to test and improve on your skills
This game is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo frakin' hard!!!! But an overall pleasant expierence. You should check it out!
