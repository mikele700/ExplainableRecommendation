Fun gameplay, great story, stunning visuals; All the signs of a great Bioshock game, and a much more worthy sequal to the original than 2 will ever be. On the topic of Rapture, the DLCs feel fleshed out and fun enough to warrent paying, and depending on your taste Clash in the Clouds, a wave based survival add-on, may not be for you.
Don't hate me buutt... I like the new update. We have all these items but no way to look at their sexyness? Inspect button.The stattraks are mainly a physical representation of some strange counters.The deteriation differneces? Oh. ♥♥♥♥ this.
