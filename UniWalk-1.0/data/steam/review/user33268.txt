I have been playing this game on my xbox since it has came out and then 4 or so months ago the disc got scratched sp not to long ago it was on sale on steam and i was like lets buy it. the gameplay online is so good the racing online is competive and fun and the loads of new friends you make but on single player the carear seems to short but all up its a great game
This game is amazing since its for free. lets admit its not as good as cood and bf but its free if the was a rating system i would give it 8/10
