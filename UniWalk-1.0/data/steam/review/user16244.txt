Great game to jam with a few friends, nice graphics, good gameplay, love the stealth aspects aswell and run gun
great fun, cant wait till the game get more features and less buggy, i already love it tho.keep up the great work
I love the story and gameplay, if only it wasnt as linear or as short (10 hours) still dont regret purchace, <3
