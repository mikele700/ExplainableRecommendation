it's good though if your not an alien or predator fan than it might get boring.the alien missions are pretty good. the stealth is nice but don't try to melee fight with the alien because it sucks ♥♥♥.Marine is a generic shooter though it can be fun making the alien's heads explode.Predator idk didn't finish it because I got bored.The graphics are alright. the finishing animations are nice but something seems off with some of them and they take way too long sometimes. Multiplayer seems dead with the exception of probably 1 server thats on at night (usually american servers though)I wouldn't bother getting the dlc
