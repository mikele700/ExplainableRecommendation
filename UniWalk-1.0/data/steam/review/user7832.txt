Love it, lots of rage as it does have a passionate community and the game does draw you in.Without giving much away, spending 15 minutes working through a dark map constantly looking over your shoulder only to get nailed when your so close to an exit does bring out the rage with a sprinkling of salt.Yes its an Indy game, yes it has its problems but it's well rounded and the bugs aren't game breaking.If you want your own horror movie experience in a game, look no further.
I don't get it, this is CS with new maps and a $15 price tag?!?
