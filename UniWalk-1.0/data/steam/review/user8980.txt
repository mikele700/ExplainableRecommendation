Still need work done to it but if they get it done it will be 10/10.
The game is great when u can play it. I have only finished 1 game the rest of the time it drops out all the time even when playing single play. I can not play the game becasue it all ways crashed.When playing the game 8/10overall game with problems 2/10dont get it until the game gets MAJOR updates or fixes.
Good game. It could of been a bit longer it took me 14 hours to finish the game. Cars have good realistic body role. The Car upgrade system would be better if had more upgrades and different ways to get the upgrades.
It is a good game. If u play it every day of ur life. If u dont all ur building will decay and u will have nothing. 4/10
