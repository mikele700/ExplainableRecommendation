Black ops III is amazing.Pros- Best Movement System in any CoD- With Zombies you actually have a propwe Objective.. Instead of going for High Rounds- You can see your feet!Cons- FPS Problems9.75/10
10/10 Definitely the best Survival Game I have ever played! Pros:- Amazingly Fun with Friends!-A very Interesting and Intriguing Map-Endless Possiblities!-Too much too list here xDCons:-Does have bugs (As excpected with an Alpha Game)-Performance Issues (As excpected once again)
I recommend DayZ standalone for all action and adventure content
