I recomend this game to anybody, ANYBODY! This game is for anybody I firmly believe this game is a 100 times better than Minecraft, and I've been playing Minecraft since Alpha. This game is truely amazing it has SO MUCH STUFF!! I CAN'T EVEN RAP MY MIND AROUND IT!
I recomend this to anybody long game and mods to play after, plus GREAT! STORY! I wish I could play this again for the first time this was such a good story line.
Really fun! This has a greaet ability to detect song beats. And I really like the songs already in the game. They are quite amazing! I recomend this game to anybody the loves music and the beats. Make sure to play the demo first before you buy the game.
This game, makes no sense at all. There is not plot. It tries to teach law, for a japanese game. I don't know.
