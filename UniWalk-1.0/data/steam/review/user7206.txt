-Payday 2 puts you and three friends in the role of a criminal gang who steal, destroy, kill, make drugs, steal some more and make lots of money doing so. Some missions are for the sneaky, some for the control freaks and yet more for the just plain blood thirsty. The missions are short yet engaging, the atmosphere fun rather than immersive, and the rewards simple: More money, more guns and more masks. Yes, masks are a thing. You would have thought they were just there to hide your face wouldn-'t you? And you would be wrong.... but don-'t think about it for now.Now it should be pointed out that you can solo this game, but the AI is pretty bad in loud missions and the game really rewards playing with friends especially on the higher difficulty levels. But probably the best thing about this game is the community and the development team for the game. There are constant updates and new heists, new weapons, new skills and even new faces. Some of these will cost you, and some are free, but in the end for the sheer amount of time I have spent in this game, and the fun I have had, this game and all its DLC have been superb value for money.- - Gopher (YouTuber/LiveStreamer)Sums it up well :)
