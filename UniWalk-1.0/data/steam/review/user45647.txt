I died so much and Killed so many demons. But it was ♥♥♥♥ing worth it. Keep in mind this aint no ♥♥♥♥ of duty no regen health here, no sprint you must move with haste and kill to survive. If this is your first doom game you are going to have one HELL of a time and if you are a returning veteran you will notice the parallels between Brutal Doom and DOOM but I can assure you that you are going to really enjoy yourself but keep in mind playing on ultra-violence or above is the real way to have the propper DOOM experience and I would recommend this dificulty even on a first playthrough (This however can be changed at any time to suit your needs). The only main problem is this game suffers from Consoleitis i.e no modding support which is a huge bummer as every Doom before this one had modding tools and support bundled with the game all that is offered here is -snap map- which has been designed for ease of use with you guessed it consoles. Not to mention of course a season pass as well which only offers Multiplayer content.Overall I rate this game 8.5/10
