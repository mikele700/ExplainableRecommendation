this game used to be good but the dev's ruined it by removing tiers, then the tech tree and now tiered blocks!! this game WAS a great game but now it is THISthis games community is also 3 year old ♥♥♥♥
a dlc for free this is madness
a more fast paced civ that has added and changed some things from civ 5 it is not as good as civ 5  but it is still a great game
CSGO is a great game but unless you are willing to play competivily and put time into this game there isnt much point of playingthe comunity is a toxic bunch of 12 year olds including me
it has dragons, unicorns, satellites, meteors, killer fish, giant squids, tornados, giant bats and spiders, jelly fish
great game,killed monsters for no reason got more stuff to help me kill monsters did that again went to another place to kill more monsters and eventually got more people to kill monsters with 10/10
