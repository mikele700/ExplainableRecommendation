Good game. Hard as ♥♥♥♥. Played it as a kid, loved the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. Loving it even harder now. Seriously, buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game.
First time playing it took me a while to understand the mechanics of the game, then once I had assembled a decent crew and vessel I set sail into the open sea... Only to be killed by Chinese Imperialists.10/10
