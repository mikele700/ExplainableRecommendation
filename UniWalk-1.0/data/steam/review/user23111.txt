Uninstalled and hid it from my library due to being against the idea of large paid content being released before the game itself is even fixed and ready. The precedent it sets is gross, and has cemented my decision to not purchase an early access title again. Being unable to refund it is a giant bummer.
YOU'RE A WINNER MAX! A WINNER!
Peaceful, lovingly made binding puzzle game. Really soothing music.
Quality platformer for those wanting time-sinky simple puzzles. Deceptively straight forward levels keep getting more expansive and difficult, sometimes requiring quite some time planning and executing.
Still my favourite point and clicky.
