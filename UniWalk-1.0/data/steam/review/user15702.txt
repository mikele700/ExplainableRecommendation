OH. MY. GOD. I LOVE THIS GAME. seriously this game is worth every dollar. Every single dollar. This is possibly the best game I have played in a very long time. The mechanics are easy to understand and I personally found it really easy to pick up and learn.I have built a house which transforms into a car, ive built a spider car, i plan to build so much more in this game.I cannot wait for the updates to this game and everything new that they add to the game.Graphically, this game is beautiful.I think something that could be cool to add to this game would be the option to customize the characters a little bit, make them more personal to the person who is playing the game.Honestly I love this game and its developers.
