Love it! I've known Tomb Raider for a long time now but never had the chance to play it, but thank GOD I bought it, it is AMAZING! The gameplay is smooth and not too hard, great puzzles and lots of intese scenes. They really nailed the game, it's simply impressive and gorgeous! The requirement isn't so harsh either, I can run it on my MacBook Air on low with barely lag, not sure for my gaming PC but definitely buy it if you are a fan of adrenaline-pumping action and First-Person-Shooter!It's kinda like Assassin's Creed mixed in with Last Of Us, but I might not be correct (please don't hate), it does have stealth and good amount of gore n' blood. The storyline was told to be crap but it isn't but lots of clich√© here and there but not too much.Overall the game is magnificent, lovely gameplay, great fun and lots of heart-stoppers. Haven't finished the game but planning to finish it soon!9.2/10
Great for -wasting- your time in this spectalluarly-hilarious game. It-'s great for multi-player, it works without having internet AND 2 computers ! Perfect ! Get it, but im not sure about getting the packs. But still a excellent game. 7.5/10 :D
