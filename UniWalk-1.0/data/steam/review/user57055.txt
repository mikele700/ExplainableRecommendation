This game is the best around. Nothing is ever going to bring this game down.Ever.Never Ever.It's good.Get it.
Great game, I played the demo for atleast 5 hours.It has great music (But sometimes it does get kind of repetetive) And the gameplay is smooth. I am really looking forward to the next update! The only thing i would say that is wrong is that in the patch im playing, Pressing T Will spawn a boxing glove to the mouse location allowing unlimited gloves and everytime a glove is fired it will do 2000+ damage. Although i know this will get patched, It's fun while it lasted.Definately pick this up if you are into rogue-likes.
Chicken loves her sword.
I haven't even bought the game on this account and steam still insists i write a review for it.10/10 would buy again
This is possibly my favourite game. Ever.I absolutely recommend this game to any one who enjoys any rogue-like games, Has a fettish for weather or loves to stack different and awesome items and become a beast. Don't forget artifacts, those are cool.Also, this game has good strats such as Boar Beach.Get. this. game.That is all.
