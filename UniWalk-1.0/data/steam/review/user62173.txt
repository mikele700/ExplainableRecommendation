Company of Heroes 2 is a fun game, for the brief time i played it, as it had a feeling of actual WW2 warfare and a sense of the years tactics, armies and weaponry. The graphics were amazing, but i had to set it on low to play the game! :(. Overall i had a fun time playing the game and it was immersive and impressive, id recommend it, as it was a awesome experience. In conclusion, im giving it a 9/10.
