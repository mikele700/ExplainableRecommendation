Horrible game, Running is like walking, walking speed is even worse, Combat is ♥♥♥♥♥♥, FOV is zoomed in way to far and no way of changing it. Walking Dead? But they can walk at a jogging speed which is faster than your run! 2/10, game should be valued at about $1
Brilliant game, 10/10, 1 really cheap really fun game that you will be playing for ages, even if you stop playing, in a couple weeks you will want to play it again!!
