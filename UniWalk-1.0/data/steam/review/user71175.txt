I can understand why Aero's Quest brings out some comtroversy. The game falls in the genre of puzzle-platformers (maybe more platformer than puzzle) which is full of good (and bad titles). It's hard to stand out in this kind of genre.Aero's quest does the job to me, I see why somebody can say that few aspects of the game are outdated but I believe that for that peice the value is there.I personally enjoyed it a lot, and I will play it till I beat it.
