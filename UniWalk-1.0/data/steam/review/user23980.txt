This game was awesome. Minecraft with Wot. Pretty sweet. You could get so many things, at such early levels. I was a tier 2 and I had an awesome jet fighter plane thing with 12 wings and some awesome plasma launchers. But now when they updated it they changed the tech tree and I lost all my wings and my guns which I had been working on for ages. Okay, fine you updated the tech tree and we have to play a bit harder to get the things we need, but don't get rid of the things we had already. I have been reduced down to tier 1 because I lost so much. It was an awesome game but now it is really meh. Ruins everything you were got and everything you did. -99/10
