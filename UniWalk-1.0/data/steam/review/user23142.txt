First Review of H1Z1:This game is in Alpha. But one problem that bugs us all is the loot respawn. Honestly until the servers and loot respawn get better I would not recommend this game at all! But overall I have enjoyed the game but it needs to improve in the next week.01/29/2015 Review:Now after playing this game so much. The respawn is too op. Making it fun but too easy. I am now recommending this game because everything is going great with the game. Loot times all good (needs fixing because its too op) bugs have been fixed. Only problem is some zombie bugs and the servers being so packed. I still recommend this game.02/04/2015 Review:So we find a car. We drive the car. I kill my friend by accident. I try and find him. I flip the car. BOMB, It blows up. H1Z1 experience 10/10 senpai03/29/2015 Review:Now everything has become a ♥♥♥♥ hole! Zombies everywhere, toooooo many bears and its like almost impossible to find ammo and you find like 20 AR's, 10 Rifles, 3 Pistols, 1-0 Shotguns and like NO M9's.....like ammo is ♥♥♥♥ed atm and guns are everywhere!!!! Where is the ****ing competition HONESTLY! My 10/10 rating on 02/04/2015 went to a 3/10......All they added that was helpful and good was a bloody ANTI-CHEAT! Good for them, they can catch hackers now but what about the people playing the game!!!!!! It's honestly the shitest minutes of your life. Okay, my friend wants me to play but how are we suppose to know where the ♥♥♥♥ friends are if there isnt a friend system. Only if you could send friend requests in game so you could see yourself and them on the hand drawn map. Okay too many bugs and requests from me just letting you know its in Alpha and TO WAIT!04/09/2015So I go for a couple of games of Battle Royal.
