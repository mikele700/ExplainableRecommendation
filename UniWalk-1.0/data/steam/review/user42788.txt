Ok, I'll admit it. I almost gave up. I'd never given the first Witcher game a chance, and when I upgraded my GPU I thought I'd skip it and start the second instalment instead.I very nearly stopped playing at the end of the first chapter, more specifically, during the boss battle with that-other-Witcher in the game. I'm not kidding, it took me almost 30 attempts and I realised that after a whole chapter, I'd learnt very little in terms of fighting technique. For me, the game was hard. Incredibly so, not least because I'd made the mistake of not exploring enough and looking for/crafting the best gear.In the end, I persisted and the game got easier insofar as my Geralt character improved a bit. The game can be unforgiving in parts, and there is a real sense of progression when you do advance.I've finished the game, but feel I've only scratched the surface and I'm keen for another playthrough. Only this time, I think I'll give the first Witcher another go.Oh, and sex scenes.
Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a relatively short game--it should only take between 3 to 4 hours to complete--but the experience it offers is fantastic. The gameplay is simple in that the puzzles aren't overly difficult (although controlling the two titular characters can get confusing at first), but the world you are cast into is both evocative and mysterious. Not much is revealed about who the brothers are, or where their world resides, and I think that adds to the experience.What I loved most about the game though, was the beautiful art design. Forget about ultra high definition textures, the environment in which you play is masterfully realised and is certainly a sight to behold.
