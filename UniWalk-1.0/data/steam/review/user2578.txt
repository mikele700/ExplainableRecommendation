If you are reading this, and choose to not get dishonoured, there is something really, really wrong with you...
I was wrong to buy this game, personally, it doesn-'t reach the expectations for reddigit-'s comment..Character Customization is terrible, there is barely one natural hair colour..Confusing Controls..Only one -Tip-..Being a little too powerful from the start..All the tools and weapons look pretty much the same..The fact that you dig materials to become stronger, when you are already pretty strong..Stuck on a single planet or boring-ness..Boring in general.
