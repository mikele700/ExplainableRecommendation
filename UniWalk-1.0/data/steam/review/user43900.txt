It'd be a great game, it really would... If it would just get past the developers credits, stop freezing, and all round ♥♥♥♥ING WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!! So no. I dont get to be a gangsta Bruce Lee in Hanoi, or wherever the ♥♥♥♥ it's set. Instead! I have to take out my fury on streetfighter, tho only OTHER place where I can be even remotely close to all that martial-arty criminal-syndicate-takedowny stuff!
