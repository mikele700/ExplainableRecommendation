Dota 2 is a fun multiplayer online battle arena game (MOBA) that requires a lot of thinking and teamwork to be on the path to victory. At first you'll pick a character that looks cool, but later on you will realise that there are other characters that are  more different and better for your playstyle. It's a great feeling when you find a character that you're good at.Every kill you get you feel like you deserve it and you earned it (unless you steal someone else's kill) and that is awesome.I haven't gone in to too much depth on this game but i feel like it  is an amazing game that will be enjoyed by so many people.Also you can eat trees sooo there's that too
One of the best online multiplayer shooters out there. Counter Strike Global Offensive actually has some skill and strategy involved unlike other shooters. There is so much you can do you would be hooked for hours.Overall it is a really great game.(i play this too much to not recommend it)
