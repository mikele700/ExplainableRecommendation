It is too unstable. The gameplay is great fun and the level of customisation is a amazing, but the instability will make a grown-♥♥♥ man cry.
Played for 2 minutes and closed it.Steam still thinks I'm playing it. In fact, Steam thinks I've still been playing it 16 hours after I closed it.It's that broken.Could have bought a gumball for what I paid for this.Gumball doesn't have commitment issues.
It's fun, but incredibly hammy, which not everyone is in to.
I like the music.
This game recognises that you're stuck and will put you back on the beaten path.That makes this game at least 100 times better than any Bethesda game.
Buy it. Now. And if you already own it, buy it for everyone you know. Its ace.
Slicker, cheaper and much, much better than Counter Strike Source
Every kill is earned, every death is justified, and more loot than you can shake an elaborately decorated minigun at. The most fun you can have with a shooter without getting arrested.
