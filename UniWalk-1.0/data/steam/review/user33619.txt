A amazing game. A most have for Christmas gamers and gamers who like a bit of a challange and humour. This will keep you entertained for hours.
LOLOLOLOLOL.This game is shutting down guys. They closed the Australian Server so now I can't play without lag. Spent real money on it just to be let down....
Masturbated and ♥♥♥♥ed my pants whilst looking at a female zombie.10/10
Killed a chicken with a $50 AWP. 50/10
Had a little bit of fun. Certainly relaxes the soul. I got it for sale for $2 so I would say money well spent.
