As much as I would like to recommend this great title to you folks to show your appreciation to the efforts of the developers, I cannot do so at the moment. For me, the game appears to be plagued with some awful game-breaking bugs involving the NPCs. It appears whenever you exit the game and load up one of your saves after opening it again, the AI of characters such as Vortigaunts and Marines seems to stop functioning. I don't need to elaborate how much this ruins the experience.As for the multiplayer, pretty much nobody really plays it at the moment. This is especially for Australian gamers like me. I do like the new character customiser, however.But as for that legendary singleplayer experience that everybody's been raving about, you might just want to stick with the free version for now until either Xen comes out or maybe a few more updates to the Steam version.
