Hey you, yes you. Come and play CS:GO, addicting game, great, freandly community. Is what valve wants you to think. When you go to play CS:GO there will always be one guy who calls you ♥♥♥♥, another that continuosly plays really bad music and if you are the unluckiest guy or girl on earth (Wich is 99% of the time) you will discover a rather peculear specimin, and their most common name is: The Sqeaker. Ah yes the CS:GO fanboy who always rushes with a sniper rifle, the person who never lets go of 'V' and somehow makes so much noise, you'd hope they would finally run out of breath and kill themselves, but no the endless fun and enjoyment out of that match will be immeasurable. Also on the last note, CS:GO has no meaning, no not the abreaviation. I mean the reason why the terrorist are planting a bomb that does absolutely nothing in the first place, beasides kill or damage players in a 100 meter radius, also there are no civilians there so the bomb has no effect. along the effectivness of the bomb only Gaben knows what the purpose of it all is, since once the bomb detonates the landmark stays intact, with just a black mark where the bomb was placed, if the maps had dynamic effects even if you couldn't alter them in game and the bomb is the cause it would still be asthetically pleasing.and good luck unboxing guys, because we all know how praising gaben with our money still won't get you that knife you've so desperately been wanting.Salty game, Roasty Meme, Review: ten out a ten for fresh salty memes. Kill yourself!
