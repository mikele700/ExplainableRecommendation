A fairly well made bullet hell shooter, not anything ground-breaking, but the roguelike elements and brilliant metal soundtrack are what keeps me playing
The gunplay is very skillful... 1% of the time. Every time I have an encounter I get shot in the back, and because of how much damage a single hit does in this game, I usually die, if not I die a few seconds later while trying to fend off two enemies.
I think if you've watched the trailer and don't have the game yet then you don't have $15 to spare. 10/10
This is not for the faint of heart, and sometimes you get cheated, but when you get the perfect run and feel your skill and confidance build it is satisfying.
