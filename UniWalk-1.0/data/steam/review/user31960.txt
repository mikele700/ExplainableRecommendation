Approximately 4.58 billion years ago our planet was formed, its name... Earth. Eventually organisms started developing and evolving to the point where humanity was sparked. Over a period of 6 million years we adpated and changed our environment to our fitting. From stone tools to the ipad we have developed many wonders and monsters. but that all changed in the fateful year of 2009. No other monstrocity or wretched idea could outrun this game, this program makes Auschwitz look like disney land, The black plague was just a prank, The Hydrogen bomb dropped upon hiroshima that killed thousands upon thousands of the innocent isnt even relevant when it comes to compare with this game. Not even lord gaben himselve can bless this demonic sin to humanity. If you desire to open pandoras box and have half of your body go into an epileptic fit that has the power of 15 frieght trains then this is the game for you.Yours Sincerly, a lost soul...
a jolly good game where the meaning of friendship and love is taught through the impalement of a razer sharp tail through your torso
This is game is an experience that cant be re-created anywhere else, i really enjoyed it from start to end. Its beauty is what i believe to be its brightest feature, along with the well thought out dialougue and the crisp sounds of the wilderness and its inhabitents.10/10
A game that features both puzzles and great ambience, this is something that relieves stress and is the perfect cure for boredom. (In my case anyway)
A game or should i say 'story' that never fails to sastify.
