I wouldnt reccomend this game until they make it playable, for me at least it has crashed my computer 4 times and reset my progress till the last time I had saved which ofc is an annoyance but still wasnt that big of a deal to me. Then after like 6 hours waiting for patches with none so far I start the game back up again and I was on a new world with a different character. BUT ANYWAYS this game when it wasnt crashing and restting my character was a very fun game and ill be back as soon as the game is playable which I hope isnt to far away
