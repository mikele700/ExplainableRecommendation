This game (so far) is an extremely fun rogue-like that may compete with Binding of Isaac to be my favourite. The controls are solid (even on keyboard), the soundtrack is great and the gameplay feels just like Megaman X, which this game takes inspiration from. To top it all off, it's an early access game. I can't wait for the game to get a fulll release, and I expect it to be quite successful and popular.
