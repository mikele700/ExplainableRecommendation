This is a great game but it is the most addictive game i have ever played. i found it very hard to get out of. Every time i started playing another game i would just go back to it within a couple of days. i think its so addictive because you wan't to get the best items you can and be better then everyone else, max your character so you can say your better then other people. i wasted a lot of time on this game but i had a lot of fun doing so.
