it makes me sad
game is so broken it broke me
It's a great game, I just suck at it.
rolly rolly rolly
For so long I was trying to find a good Diablo II style RPG, I had seen torchlight 2 but never considered it and when I finally gave in and got it I played it for days straight, it gave the feeling of Diablo II with a whole lot of new content and addons through steam workshop. I absolutely love it. 10/10
