Just bought the game maybe an hour ago, have played a few rounds of it and love it. The environments are fantastic, looking forward to more when they come out. The sharks are amazing, the look of them, the movements amazing. The game is lots of fun, intense, heart pounding, you actually fear for your life once the music starts haha, and I'm so excited to be apart of it.  For game at this stage it is amazing. Definitely a game everyone should get their hands on. survival mode absolutely amazing sharks literally keep you on your toes, but pvp (sharks and divers), and the heart pounding intensity goes to a whole new level.All in all, a game for everyone, definitely a must, and definitely a game to keep and eye on. 10/10
