does not look good and the person maker just has 2 options and even the controlls suck its not worth the download let alone buying stuff in game
great game its hard but you keep coming back (though i may suck at it) it took me 24 days to get out and usely i give up but i keeped comeing back so great game and im readdy to take 48 days to get out on the next also i love what they are gonna add 1st they will add mutiplayer if posssable and 2nd prison editer 3rd person editer so i say buy it if you have the money.
this is a awesome game it is like assasssins creed but with out assassinenting peaple you have guns and out REALLY soon is a mutiplayer mod its free(the mod NOT the game) and now i'm gonna play it have fun-max maker
