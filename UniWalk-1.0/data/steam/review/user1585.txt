This is possibly one of the best games I have played even though it is so simple. If you have $5, buy this game. It is one of the best invesments you will ever make.
THis game has way too many bugs that need fixing. Sometimes you can't even start a match. There are better MMO's out there than this.
Game is very fun for most of the story line but gets very repetitive. The free running is very annoying sometimes but good game in general.
