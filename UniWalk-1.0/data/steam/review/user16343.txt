At the time of writing this i have 57 hours sunk in and i will continue to play it, this is my summary of the game: (will change review with they fix game)i love playing the killer, mainly the trapper, it is by far the most enjoyable part of the game. I make a lobby and imediatly rank 1s and 5s join becuase evan though this game has a rank system, it doesnt do ♥♥♥♥. The game runs on player to player connection based on the host, the host is always the killer, and because i live in a poor internet area of Australia isnt good, so 2 people disconect from the game imediatly, which makes it less fun for me and probably the 2 other people. The last 2 people are rank 1s and they both have a skill which COMPLETLY destroys the trappers class, so by the time they do there 1st generator, I only have 1 bear trap left out of the 12 i started with. -play a different killer- some people are probably saying, but the only other 2 killers in the game dont suit my kind of play style.My only options to play the game now are play as a laggy survivor because of said internet location, evan though i dont really like survivors, or dont play the game. You see a problem with that?
