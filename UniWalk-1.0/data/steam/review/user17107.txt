As-Steroids. That's pretty much what it is. 10/10
Great racing game. It's kinda like the Wipeout games on PSP.9/10
Dafaq is this brain dead piece of crap game.I'm glad it was free, so i didn't have to waste my damn money.
If you like zombie games, then i would not recommend this one cos the controls are ♥♥♥♥ and the gameplay is dull. You are better off playing L4D1&2. 2/10
Finally! A game that runs perfectly on my macbook! Awesome game by the by. 10/10
Great game to play if you bored and wanna play a cool liddle puzzle game. ^-^9/10
