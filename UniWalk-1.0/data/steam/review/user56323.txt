Everyone loves this game. :P So many things to do.WORTH IT'S MONEY
I got the game whilst it was on 75% off so I got it for $10.Not sure that I'd want to pay the full price for this game though.Around $30-$40 would be ok. But for $10, great game. :P
Obviously one of the best games on Steam. ;)And it's fweeeeee! :P
Apart from the long wait times to get into a server and for the games to start... and the short games... and the fact that it-'s pay to win... it-'s a pretty good -Free to play- game...
This game has a bright future I think.After 30 hours or so of playing theres nothing to do though. But I'm sure after the months pass there will be more and more to do.
Decent little game. Worth it's small ammount of money. ;)
