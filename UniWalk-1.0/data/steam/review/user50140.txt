You join the game with ONE purpose...To earn yourself some sweet hats.So what do you do?You pwn noobs for hatsYou play with 12 year olds for hatsYou pay thousands of dollars for hatsYou rack up countless hours just grinding and grinding....All of this you will do for your grand quest of owning ALL the hats.Will you succeed? Probably.But there's one thing I know for sure. You'll absol-SPY SAPPIN' MAH SENTRY!
Things you'll learn when you play NMRiH:- Teamwork is rarer than decent loot in Destiny, and that's saying something.- There will ALWAYS be people who'll horde all the ammo and weapons instead of taking what they need.- 3/5 times you'll have some guy in your team that plays the badass and runs ahead of everyone before getting killed at the other end of the map by a kiddie zombie.- People don't actually know how hammers and planks work.-Trigger discipline doesn't exist.-When your name goes red, you know someone's bound to take a swing at you.- THE PILLS, I KNOW YOU HAVE THEM.- Favela is the haven for stockpilers.- Half the players don't get the references to popular zombie movies and books.Overall it's a good game with terrible players. 6/10 for me.
