I rather throw 50 dollers down the drain then let these lazy, money grabbing developers have it. this is the most expensive and worst game in my library. it has sh*ty AI, the combat is horrible. all of the statues eh i mean zombies are always in a line facing behind you so you just stealthy kill them all... you might have 3 or 4 -zombies- that you actully have to fight which is just light attack x2 heavy attack x1. the graphics are fu*king horrible (at full settings). do not be fooled by the name it is a fu*king horrible game
1) jump2) die3) cry4) repeat but for real this game is awesome
