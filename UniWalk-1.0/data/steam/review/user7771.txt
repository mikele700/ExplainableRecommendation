Originally bought it for the Playstation and out of lazyness bought it for PC too. Slightly different to Dearsiders 1 with more plot holes and similar gameplay and  the controls aren't ported for PC very well. If you enjoyed Darksiders 1 more than a little bit you'll enjoy 2, if not you're better off elsewhere
