This game didn't get me hooked like dark souls did. the first game had better mechanics, better atmosphere and better everything really. if you want a good experience get the first game not this.
I don't know why I really really enjoy this game so much. Is it because i enjoyed the Borderlands games? is it because it paid me in cocaine to like it? is it becaused it isn't so overhyped like Overwatch? the answers being Yes, 1kg a day and Probably.
This has to be one of my favourite games ever.yeah its a bit buggy so who cares.the graphics are not the greatest so what.the game is difficult who cares.You get to mow down the cast of jurassic park.i could make a whole list on why i would recommend this game but i don't really have to play the game and youll see why i think this is a great game
The Stanley Parable is insanity yet sane, chaotic yet planned, confusing yet understandable in other words Perfect.
When Dark souls 2 was released i was so t5hen i played it and then got so disapointed that i told myself i would never by another dark souls again, then a saw this on sale and i thought to myself 'surely it won't be bad' and now im so so glad for getting it now. this is without doubt a great souls game and probably be my best game of 2016 (Suck it Overwatch). this game is so great that i broke my headphones over it. really no other game has made me brake something before and this is the first to do so, therfore it is a great game.
A pure masterpiece of gaming RPG. If u are even remotely interested in games this is a must. Garunteed addiction to it.
this is one of the greatest hack n slashes of all time.do you enjoy slashing your foes to bits?do you enjoy destroying a horde of super soldiers?do you love slashing gaint mechs while listening to epic music?if you answered yes to the above then this is the perfect game for you
