Life just became more complicated... I can not wait until the multiplayer games start and the screams over the channel appear with.-You #$!!@@!!% seduced my wife !!!-Thanks Paradox....
I have always loved to burn my time on Paradox games. But this one is really great.. Change history and make it yours.
Well its Europa Universalis from paradox :) If you do not know it by know your not part of the hardcore conquer the world team !Its a great upgrade from EU III It has  several DLC now but you do not need them to play the game.
First I love the game, it has a fun storyline and loads of humor.Its a good game to play with buddies You can shoot and loot all the stuff you wantDisadvantage, the loot is shared so when you play with other people they can pick up the stuff you want.
