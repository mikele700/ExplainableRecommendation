If you've played a game, you should know that Skyrim is amazing. Definitely a game to play before you die.
Awesome game, fits me perfectly. It's got the rogue-like feel of the Binding of Isaac but it's an FPS. I love it.
It's free, quick download, it's about an hour of fun (if you go for the hard mode victory). Yeah, I recommend this. Nice music too :)
