Its pretty good but it would be WAY better if it wasnt just Multiplayer like maybe some AI and even a campaign would be cool.
I love it when zombies clip through walls -_-But really, this game is good, fun and all that good stuff (top memes) it runs worse that arma3 and thats pretty bad don't buy this unless your keen to lose $50 or whatever this costs -EDIT- After 0.60 the game is enjoyable, but it took 3 YEARS for that to happen. It is slowly turning back into the mod and all its greatness. The game is good, but the devs... not
because i have the game
Bain decides to buy cheap drills... He shall pay for this, oh crap, be right back, my drill is broken.11/10 would repair drills again.But truely, this game is amazing, some people say it's repetitive, but theres a lot of ways you can do things, One thing i recommend about this game (apart from buying it) is getting a mod called hoxhud, it really improves the game in lots of ways. compared to PAYDAY: The heist, this game is amazing, theres heaps more heists customisation, and all out fun! BUY IT FOR THE GREATER GOOD! spelling is good in this review...Edit:It's all fun and games until they add microtransactions
