Never have I experienced such grace and beauty from a video game. The action, thrills and comedy instilled in this work of art is just too much for someone to experience within even hours of playing. Absolute joy and happiness is brought forth by this work of art. I can't go on, i must return to the Mountain. 10/10 would become a mountain again.
