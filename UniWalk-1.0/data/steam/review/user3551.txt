Very fun game loads of modding and custom maps to be played.
Very fun and enjoyable game with loads of content and hours of fun gun blasting enjoyment.
After finishing this game i have to say it is one of the most story driven games out there. All of the decisions you make can either set you up for a decision later on in the story or could mess you up and screw you over. whatever choice you make will be your story there are hundreds of ways to complete this game was fun, funny and sad at times overall great experience.10/10
