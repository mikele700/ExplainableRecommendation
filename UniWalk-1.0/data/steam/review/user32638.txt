THIS GAME IS A CLASSIC, END OF STORY!THE SECOND OF ITS KIND, FPS WISEID SOFTWARE AND JOHN ROMERO WORKED ON THIS PRODGECT, SO YOU KNOW ITS GOOD!
I haven't played any of the other Saints Row games, but I got this one because of Angry Joe's review, I thought this was the type of game to just do whatever you wanted to do in it, and I was right! You can do (almost) anything you ever wanted to do in GTA, but with super powers, who can go wrong with that?!
