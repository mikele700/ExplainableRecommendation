I would recommend for sure. This game is a blast for those who like puzzle games. Theres plenty of levels and new thing on each, I loved it. only problem is once you beat all the levels there isnt much else to do, you can go for all the collectables but after that I you may or may not lose interest, I dont know, not everyone is the same as me. regardless, I loved the game and the only two things that I have thought of that would make the game better is if you added community made maps or have updates with new levels.P.S. - I havent played the game very recently and dont know if there have been any updates so some of my info might be wrong, Sorry.
