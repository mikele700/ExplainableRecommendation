This game WAS one of my favourite games of all time. I just enjoyed it so much. I may not have been very good but it was fun. I supported overkill by buying all the dlcs (no regrets) and encouragng friends to play the game. But now something has changed. Overkill has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off an entire fanbase with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t microtransactions. I have this review to help show Overkill see that even there die hard fans are done with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and they need to fix their ♥♥♥♥.
I am happy that the first dlc isnt payed. I hope this continues, not too much dlc and not too expensive unlike some simialar games (payday 2). Please don't ♥♥♥♥ off your community if you want this game to have one.
This is not worth the money. I dont know what game these people were playing but this game is shocking. No reload animations, arguably bad gun sharing machanics, gun shots sound like bb guns, music is insanly loud by diffualt, weird volume changers (no slider, clicking to change volume), one zombie type, terrible zombie pathfinding and terrible models.
Isn't Overwatch
