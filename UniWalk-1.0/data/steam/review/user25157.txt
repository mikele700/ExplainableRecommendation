This project does something rare. If you allow yourself to be taken by it, you feel like you're part of something larger than yourself. All of me wants to believe that Coda is out there and that what i played is real. And i do believe that, i really do. I hope i play this a hundred times over, and each time i hope to notice something different, think of something different. Because every pixel in this project has something about it, something i just can't put my finger on yet.
