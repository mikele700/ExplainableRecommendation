A very unique game with a steamPunk(Or WhalePunk more so)Vibe so it.Featuring varied ways of combat and traversing levels from running atop victorian-esque houses to skulking below guards in dingy sewers with them none the wiser.The gameplay benefits from a varied range of powers at your dispoal such as Blink,a power making you capable of swiftly teleporting forth to traverse the envrioment or swiftly dispatch a guard with a sneaky neck slice.The real star of the game is the Stealth aspect though lacking in some aspects(Non-lethal options such as weapons are generally lacking),there are so many ways to go about the levels as each area is multi-leveled with plenty of dilapidated houses which hint at a life gone past.The only real let-down is the story that is somewhat generic,you're the meperess's guard that gets framed for her murder(Hence the title dishonored)You then must go and clear your name which involves 'dealing' which various people of importance which opens up the question;Will you decapitate them in a bloody display of utter brutality or will you dispatch them with a well thought out non-lethal way?The length of the game is about 11-14 hours depending on if you choose to be a ghost unseen by the enemy or a menacing murderer(The latter usually cuts the game down to about 6-8 hours).I spent around 40+ hours on the game as i played it on Xbox 360 first and did a non-lethal,Lethal and ghost(No detection or kills) playthrough.I would highly recommend the game as it's a gem in an endless sea of generic FPS and MMOs,especially if your a fan of Deus Ex and Bioshock.
