When I got this game, it looked as though it would be very fun, but as I started playing it, I found that it was quite boring, and the gameplay consisted of clicking people so they didn't die. At $20.00 I thought that this was a riduculous price for the game, which in all honesty, should really be a tablet game, the way you play it is just not good for a PC.

I strongly reccomend it, if you-'re unsure, you should try one the initial flash games before deciding.
