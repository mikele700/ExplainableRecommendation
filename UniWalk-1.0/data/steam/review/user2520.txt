I belive this game has lots going for it however the one big negative is that with out other/ friends this is no where as fun as it should be. The recent update has brought out paid for DLC which yes is annoying to say the least howerver people may its ealy accses but i can not agree less this game need thing like paid for DLC to survive it isn't minecraft where addons costed $10 to make it takes at least a $100 for each feacher in this game so mostly positive is a good review for this game.
