Was fullly developed in the first hour, a tornado rocks in and destroys everything. People starve to death because of now food. 11/10 would worship the tornado gods again
Threw a stormtrooper into another one10/10Would throw again
10/10 really good game
Quite fun for a RPG, Worth playing if u find skyrim and cod fun
