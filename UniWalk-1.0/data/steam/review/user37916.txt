DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IN CURRENT STATE. SO INCREDIBLY AWFUL. there is potential but this crap should not be in early access yet. I know what early access means before you try to remind me, i know what I signed up for, but you at least expect some kind of quality of gameplay when a developer allows consumers to play their title. this game is a sham and a cashgrab at its current state. DO NOT BUY EARLY ACCESS, WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT PROPER. whenever the hell that will be.
Do you fantasize about taking long strolls on abandoned russian highway for hours at a time with little to no reward?I have just the game for you.
Create ♥♥♥♥♥ forts for all your ♥♥♥♥♥ friends so you can run around the ♥♥♥♥♥ forest looking for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There are also bears sometimes.A fantastic childrens game, My kids love it.
piece of unoptimised buggy sh!T. avoid like the plague.
Insanely fun, and refreshingly original take on a very tired genre. GET IT!
minimal flags and only one black person, false advertising.also johnny depp bleached his hair.
If you like bioshock, then you will probably feel indifferent to this game as this game has nothing to do with bioshock.Its a groundbreaking new game that dares to go where no other game has gone before, by having zombies as your enemy in a survival setting.  BUT WAIT, its also minecraft.What a time to be alive.
