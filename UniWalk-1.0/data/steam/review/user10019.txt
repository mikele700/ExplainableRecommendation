I just released how awesome grappling hook's are.
This game is fantastic.So when you need to reccomend a game to friends, people always ask about the gameplay and always the graphics, controls and the plot.Gameplay:It's a beat-em-up 2D, which has some details from RPG games. The way the game work is pretty simple, pretty simply awesome!!You have 4 characters to start off with (those shown on the logo, red, green, orange, blue) Each characters have the same skills (attacks) but all have different appearances and magic skills. Such as, the red character is electric, green is poison I think, orange is fire and blue is ice. There are other unlockable characters but these are the main ones. For the abilties to come into place, each character has unlockable magic levels (to level up magic, strength, agility, and defence) the player must gain XP by defeating enemies and once leveling up gets 'points' to spend on those levels. So by leveling up strength your player is more powerful and can unlock more combos, defence the player doesn't have a higher health level but takes less damage from attacks, agility makes the player run faster and makes the bow more badass. The trick is to balance out the things you level up, otherwise you will have a character with too much defense but not powerful enough to kill enemies etc, or a player who cannot use the magic powers for the character he/she is using, which is bad, since the magic in this game is what makes it good too.The game is a great co-op, I played with a friend and there's also other gametypes apart from the storyline arena and stuff, the only problem with the co-op is that it always shows waiting for players because of lag and has to pause the game which is annoying if you're playing with someone with bad internet.Another cool thing is you can play as other characters and level them up, unlock a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of characters by playing arenas + levels + beating the game can unlock a new character.Graphics:They are really nice on this game, I think by default its medium but the games graphics look nice and another thing to note is I haven't had any problems with lag, apart from one level where it lags a bit at one point, but the game runs smooth and yeah, the graphics look nice.Controls:PLAY WITH A PS3/XBOX CONTROLLER!! My PS3 controller, unfourtantely didn't work so I had to use keyboard, I love keyboard but it's so hard to get used to the controls, they didn't even show the correct controls for keyboard just the xbox controller ones so it took a while to figure out what they were + getting used to them but after playing for a few minutes I got used to them. A handy tip is to go on the options menu.Story:I won't ruin anything but the story of the game isn't one of those full on plot ones where the whole game is all about the story, even though all the fights go up to the story but they don't go oh the story here all the time which I enjoyed, but it's a great story.Op:This game is cheap, but gives hours of enjoyment and fun on co-op, I can recommend this to anyone.
Who wouldn't want to ride their music, In Audiosurf you do :D
A very enjoyable game, who said teleporting through Portals isn't fun.I used to play the original Portal, that was until I beat it really fast but Portal 2 is alot different from the first Portal.Get Portal 2 and Portal 1 go on a marathon and see how fast you can beat both of the games, that is what I've done :) :)
One of the most fun games I've played, but one of the shortest in different ways, but there's backends to that statement.Uplink is a game where you're an Uplink agent and must do missions on 'hacking' for money and gain ranks, with this money you can buy 'hacking tools' which you use on hacking missions. You can also buy upgrades for your gateway.The game is really old so it seems really fake (logging into systems using a password cracker and copying, modifying, deleting files and deleting your logs.)Even if you do finish the game early, basicly by reaching top status and hacking into the bank accounts of people and getting rich, upgrading your hud to the best and grabbing the Uplink agent user file and putting them all in jail or saying their all dead, you can get the alternative storyline, which is, very fun.This game is really fun even though it can be hard and boring but I've enjoyed playing it.
hats yeah
