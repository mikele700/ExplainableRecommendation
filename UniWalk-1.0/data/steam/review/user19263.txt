Ok, ive reviewed it before, but i feel like i should review it based on a perspective of a Marvel fanboy & an avid gamer:The game is really fun to play, especially when you play this game with friends, yes, you either need to pay or work your way to a new hero, but games like these expect you to work hard for rewards, and working is better than just buying your way to victory, graphics are ok for me on my laptop, I like the fact that their adding more & more heroes as the game grows, I also like the fact that their adding more & more to the story of the game, making the game much more hyped for new players, you got heroes voiced by some of the most talented voice actors ever, like Deadpool, voiced by the great Nolan North, the gameplay itself is enhancing, you get to experience different movesets per hero & get to really play your hero more in order to perfectly master their moves, with PVP soon to be out of beta, the in-game dialogue and the fact that heroes can actually have conversations with each other is down right awesome, more heroes, great story, hard work, just wat you can expect from MMORPG'sAnd also, I also saw a review that a person does not recommend the game because he wants the game to be optimized to Xbox controllers, try playing DOTA 2 with an Xbox controller, then update your reviewOverall, yeah, get the game, it may be high in memory, their may be big updates, but throughout all that, its all gonna be worth itScore for Marvel fans/avid MMORPG gamers: 9.5/10Score for non-Marvel people: 7.3/10
