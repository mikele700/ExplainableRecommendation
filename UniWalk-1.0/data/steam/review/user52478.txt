At the time of writing this review I just finished the game about 30 minutes ago. Now, when I finished it, I felt amazing, and this game makes you feel amazing, both with its story (which I won't spoil) and gameplay. But, I finished it in 14 hours, which I didn't have that much a problem with exept for the fact that I finished dust:an elysian tale the day before in also 14 hours, and that was made by 1 person, which got me thinking, thinking about why there's such a similarity between game completion rate and such a big difference between development. However, this greatly redeemed itself when at the end of the credits it said that I completed 2% of it's entirety. Now, the gameplay is very good, from perfect platforming (alliteration!) to a well made third-person shooter, this game trully makes you feel like a badass and at times a genius when you finish a puzzle from a tomb. The only problem I had with the gameplay was the QTEs (quick time events) which got repetitive at times and made me die too many times. Another problem I had was the community for the multiplayer, the problem? It didn't exist, no-one plays multiplayer so I cant really talk about it much. to conclude, Tomb Raider is an amazing single player game with the problem of annoying QTEs and a non-existant multiplayer community, I recommend it for the single player, not the multiplayer.
I weep for all the people who were mislead in trailers. of all the games people could have gotten on steam, they were unlucky enough to buy this trainwreck, don not buy at all costs!
