A great experience. It really tests what you think is right and what you think is needed for the survival of the group. Clementine is a great character who you will try to protect with your life. Every Decision matters and most will stay with you throughout the rest of the game. If you want a zombie game that is more about choices keeping the group alive then look no further than the walking dead
Terraria is a fun and easy to learn game. it involves key building elements similar to minecraft but also includes great exploration and customization. This game is a great game and i highly recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable different game
