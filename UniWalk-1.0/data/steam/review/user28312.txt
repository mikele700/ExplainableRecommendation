Dota flippin 2, by a long shot my fav game to play on the good ol pc. (not like i play anything else though) This game is prehaps one of the best freetoplay game ever. ok correction, is the best freetoplay game ever. Dota 2 has a very sketchy begining for most players. I really didnt see what was so good about at the begining, it felt........ bland and not very exiting. but after a few matches with my friends and a few good wins, MY LIFE BECAME DEDICATED TO MASTERING THIS GAME. And now ever after 503 hours i still have a very long way to go. Dota 2 has a big learning curve at the begining, as you'll here from every other player. There are so many aspects of the game to learn. But even at the begining it is insainly fun, and as you develop your skill the game becomes more and more enjoyable. And if you get really good you can assemble a worthy team, and if our teams got the skillz to pay the billz you can run for the Dota 2 International championships, however that an very very long shot. but hey the prize money is 10 million flippin dollars this year, and next year it will grow even bigger. So why not try hey.So go flippin get this game and waste thousands of enjoyable hours of your life doing no much.(And please please what ever you do, dont play F**KING RIKI)
its fun n'stuff
