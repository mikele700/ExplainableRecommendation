It has created a game so challenging, yet satisfying that you never want to put it down. You will always be coming back for one more run. In that run, who knows what awaits you. All you know is that a new challenge will be there and most likely strike you down and kill you. But it is for fun aye?The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth - 10/10
Banished is the kind of game that teaches you life skills of persistence and to never give up. Especially when I plague comes over your whole town and kills everyone. Banished is a great city builder that doesn't contain a large amount of micro-managing. By no means does this make the game any easier. It is brutual and will cause you to think of different ways to approach each new town. The music is incredible and sometimes great to just relax to. This is the kind of game that keeps bringing you back, thinking that the next town will be better. A style in which the more you player the greater the knowledge you will attain.9/10
