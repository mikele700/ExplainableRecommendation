Made a robot with 4 hailfires, things that shoot barrages of dynamite. It was the most horrible thing I've ever done..do not do what I did, people suffered, lives were lost, wives were widowed. I can't sleep at night anymore. Don't do it..for the love of god. 11/10
Buy this game, listen to Sabaton and set up the MG nest! LET THEM BULLETS FLY!11/10
Get it! don't ask! no time! just download this! the fate of this planet depends on you to play this game now in all its awesome silly glory! it just over the top in regards to how I can customise my characters, Helga is hot, my weapons are hot! my favourite would have to be the pulse. 8/10, would Helga again.
Good fun game if you can find a match. The AI are outright ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so I wouldn't captain unless you have actual people that will repair ♥♥♥♥ not wander about the deck like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ starfish. With that, the game is fun if you can find a match and crew that aint AI. Trust me, Brinks AI? are smarter..thats sayin' something I think.
