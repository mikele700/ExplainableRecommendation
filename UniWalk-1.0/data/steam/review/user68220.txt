After seeing this game on steam a while ago I thought, -Hey, A WWI Trench Shooter, That Might be fun.- And Boy was I right. Verdun is an absolutely brilliant game and if you are in the least bit interested you should give it a go. The Unity 5 engine has been used to great effect and it has a smooth and immersive gameplay. Some maps will lag for about 1-3 seconds, however this is a rare occasion [New Updates seem to have fixed this]. This game is worth every cent of the price and is far above the Call of Duty for a game of this type. The Battlefields are amazing and it now has medals, Like the Medal of Honour. 9/10
