Overall this game was a unique experience that is not your everyday type of game, but is worth playing and I would suggest this game to almost anyone. It is a game that simply tells a beautiful and tragic story. It sucks you in emotionally and does not let go. i have not played any other game that has got me to care about video game characters so much.
super hexagon is a fantastic blend of arcade action, unforgiveing difficulty and is just so so addictive. the description of this game isnt very clear so i'll explain what it is in a bery brief decription. it is a very fast pace game where you a a small shape dodging other shapes comeing your way(there is an example in the vidio).  i would recomend this game to almost evryone and for just $3( $0.60 at the moment) it is most definitely worth your time and money.
