from what i have played this game is really good and its free but there are somethings i don't understand. i haven't played long enough to do a full cons and pros but here are some:pros:-the maps are well designed and spawn placement is reasonable.the guns sound real and work as they should.fun to playfree to playcons:-no australian servers (hopefully there will be some in the future)weird glowing things that kill you are placed in the most stupid locations often causing no access to areas.
SO MUCH GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
When i first tried this game its was dificult i died almost everytime i met a zombie.But then i found something... a gun... full of ammo... Nato ammo... i shoot zombie in head... he died.. I shot more zombies... they died... i had fun.The point is this game at a first glance is boring, difficult and frustrating but when you get some good items you can start having awesome fun. I haven't tried multiplayer yet but it looks really fun.10/10 would bang again
This game is ♥♥♥♥ing horrifing. All thanks to the atmosphere (dark and scary) and the lighting (dark and scary). If you want -CRY OF FEAR- then this is the game for you.
