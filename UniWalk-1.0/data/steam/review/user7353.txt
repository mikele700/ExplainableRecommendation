I love the game. Although some people say -IT-'S PAY TO WINNN!!!!- Not really. If you want the good, juicy stuff, you-'re gonna have to get it yourself. Everything that you can buy is completely and easily (With some grinding) obtainable.So, in the end... I love Warframe.
Got a 390, overclocked 4690k. Running at around 60fps with massive dips of 20 or below. Planet textures look like A**. Wouldn't recommend at it's current state.
