Shallow storyline, poor gameplay mechanics, many bugs.This is without a doubt the least entertaining WWII shooter I've ever experienced.Extremely repetative gameplay; pick up your gun, point and shoot towards the Nazis. Poor dialogue and the AI works in mysterious ways.The only positive aspect about the game is pretty scenery and good visuals in general.
Interesting and pretty game, however gamebreaking frustrating controls.Quit the game ages ago as I was stuck because of controls - reinstalled again much later and I can't even get through tutorial because of it.
Fantastically captures teenage years/drama. Lovely soundtrack. Immerses the player in the interesting story, easy to get hooked. Very much looking forward to the upcoming episodes!
-So we need someone to cook, someone to keep watch and someone to do some heavy lifting... little girl, how -'bout you help me with these crates over here?-This is a great game full of nerve-racking decisions and rich story.The only downside is the strange dynamics; the main character is a little girl and some of the tasks/decisions assigned to her make little sense.
