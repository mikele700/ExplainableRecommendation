Not sure if a recent patch has broken these trials but the challenges and achievements have become a ridiculous matter of luck instead of skill.I have spent hours restarting the Bend Time Massacre with character's dying on opposite ends of the room, bullets hitting targets but do nothing and exposives go off when now wanted and do not when needed.Kill Cascade is bugged as prompt appears but clicking to drop assassinate does nothing.Entire DLC is a mess and needs fixing.Need to get off this game before the pure frustration leads me to smashing my PC.
