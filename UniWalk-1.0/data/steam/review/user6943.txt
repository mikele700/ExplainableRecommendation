Some say it's not as good as Supreme Commander (1) or Forged Alliance, and I think I'd agree with them. However, Supreme Commander 2 is still an awesome RTS which lately seem to be fewer and further between...If however you thought SC1 / FA had too much micro-management (with units AND resources), you'll probably enjoy SC2 more!
F2P MMORTS. Haven't personally played any of the Stronghold franchise, but this particular game is good. Not a huge time-sucker (doesn't require whole hours of attention, just small consistent bursts to keep it going strong), and there's a bit more tactics to it than some RTS games, and a LOT more diplomacy ^_^
If you think your FPS is a bit too much of a run-and-gun, give Planetside a go! It adds a fair bit of strategy to your basic FPS formula.So if you want your chaingun to capture continents, jump in - it's Free to Play, so it's not exactly going to cost you anything but time...
It's DOTA, it's Valve, it's free. 'nuff said.
Ye old'e Class warfare! Great fun!
Good puzzler, short value but. Portal 2 should be better with multiplayer, although they should consider adding a map editor too...
Simple fun mayhem!
