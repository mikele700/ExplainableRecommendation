I got this game through trading and it's the best thing I've bought using digital keys.This is the only game I know in existence (aside from FALLOUT: NEW VEGAS of course) that gives you the ability to talk a loser out of shooting you, make said loser feel guilty about their life choices AND extort the poor sap while you're at it. This game showed me that there are indeed other ways to solve your problems aside from shooting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the face... namely getting everything that person owns along with interest and then leaving them to rot in the nuclear wastelands of Washington DC.10/10
Nothing spells teamwork better than charging at an infected horde with a melee weapon in hand to save a friend who got barfed on by a Boomer while another teammate of yours flings a Molotov Cocktail in your general direction and the last guy plays SNIPER ELITE with a hunting rifle miles away from the main conflict.10/10
I've been fighting on the battlefields of Dustbowl, Bad Lands, 2 Fort and god knows how many other maps for the past 5 years (the first 2 being in an internet cafe) and I still get the adrenaline rush of slaughtering everything and everyone in my path while using my handy dandy (Strange) Black Box.With experience accumulating to 5 years and counting, I'd say this is the only online FPS that matters.
