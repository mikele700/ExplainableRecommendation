Yeah... Umm...I really didn't intend to spend so much time playing this. Actually that isn't the real confession.  I really didn't intend to spend so much money on virtual hats. 11/10
Jesus Christ give me the next one already!I've had enough of sunlight and social interaction...MY BODY IS READY
This was the first game I ever bought on my Steam Account. Purchasing it mid 2011, i have watched it grow from a small, well done sandbox game with 4 bosses to a brilliant, bar setting work of its genre with thousands of items and over 11 bosses.Pros - Dedicated developers- Mounds of content- A high skill cap- Amazing MultiplayerCons- A possible downside, alothough not for myself, could be the particular art style- Some bosses challenging difficulty- Incredibly rare drops that make you farm for hours.This game is amazing, 9.9/10, and every hour ive spent on it has been worth it.
i liek it cos i injoy gmaes that is fun and i like trucks somertimes becuss they're can be somantims cars
i spent 22 minutes of my life playing this before i realised i could have gone fishing in real life. no regrets.
