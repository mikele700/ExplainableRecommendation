i highly reccomend borderlands 2 as i has a good jump in jump out co-op which makes it a good game for me as if you need some help in a quest or just want to play some borderlands with your friends and just being able to leave whenever you want. i also like the full controller support as if you were a console user you can still use a controller or use a keyboard like tradditional PC gamers. I also love the style of the game simplistic but elegant and uses the cartoon graphics to its advantage. i also love the gameplay so many missions to choose from with many side quests to keep you busy and also the open world to run round finding all different types of weapons and loot to help you in your quests. All over a wonderful game to play and waste hours with friends. I highly recommend it.
