I'll give you a good idea of what will happen during the first hour of the game. Firstly you will wake up on a sandy beach scratching that tiny misquito bite on your arm. You look around and realise you are surrounded by a bunch of dinosaurs, but don't panic not all of them are out to eat you, except for those Dilos those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s would eat their own babies if given the chance. First thing you need to do is punch a tree, yes I said punch a tree. Then collect some berries to eat. Oh no looks like you are thirsty, go take a dive into the water to have a drink. Run away there a giant shark thing chasing you. Oh you just pooped, it's edible but I wouldn't recommend it. Oh look a dilo just killed you.Until you get the hang of this game you will die, a lot. But it is definitely one of the most fun games I have played in a very long time. It's still in Early Access so a lot of the content hasn't been implemented and there are still a lot of bugs. Even so there is heaps to do and the developers are amazing as they release a new patch everyday.
