Team Fortress 2 is a very fun and fast-paced game. It is different from COD I hear and it may take a while to get used to but it is definitely worth it.What I liked is the classes in generally and their funny personalities.Each class is different in such a way, it's hard to see how they work together so soundly.What I don't like about This game however, is the players. Actual people. Some people can be really nasty and mean. It is rare to find nice people and many of those mean people have the same people; Noobs wearing gibus shouldn't be playing... Fortunately, I'm not a 'gibus noob'.Also, the fact that people don't know how to play the game properly doesn't really help your chances of success.There is a training course but that doesn't teach much. Just how to play to classes. Not how to play a gamemode, the value of teamwork and it doesn't give any tips.But above all that, Team Fortress 2 was, and is a great game that should be played with friends.And it's free.FOREVER!!!!
