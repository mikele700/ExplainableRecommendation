After playing this game for so long it pains me to write this review, however i feel that it is my duty to write this.1st point TF2 is becoming stale, the community is slowly dying as people find it harder and harder to enjoy the game caused from a miriad of reasons Reason one: The game's deep class based gameplay is somewhat ruined by the people who play, EG: when you join a server and everyone is playing spy or heavy or whoever the point is that although there is 9 classes most of the time people will all gravitate to one class such as the spy or the engi or if the other team collectivlt becomes the antichrist and stacks pyro.Reason 2 HALF OF THE SERVERS ARE EMPTY AND 3 QUARTERS ARE TRADE SERVERSReason 3 TF2 has basicly become and economy of hats and wepons, this is good if you like buying things in the game rather than playing itReason 4 THE SMISSMAS UPDATE IS A BETA?!Reason 5 Some wepons or classes can be a pain at times 2nd Point: a game can only last so long and im afraid that TF2 is on its last legs so enjoy the game while you can RIP TF2 you hold a special place in my heartPre bumber cars 10/10 after smissmas 6/10
