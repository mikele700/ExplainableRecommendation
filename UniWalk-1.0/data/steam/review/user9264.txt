TF2 is a fun F2P that is surprisingly not a pay to win, unlike some other F2P's ...There are micro-transactions, obviously, how else are they gonna make money but you can totally live without it. All the classes have their own attractions and almost evey player will be able to find their play style pretty easily. The community is okay, the servers are good, nothing is to OP. There is really nothing bad with this game. I mean its free, give it a shot.
