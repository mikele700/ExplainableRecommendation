This game is a rollercoaster. This 2013 released finale(?) in the Bioshock series holds up very well. The best part is that playing the first 2 isn't even really a necessity if you're just playing it to play it. The ending may be a bit confusing without a little background on at least the plot of the first, but if you're just looking for a good time where story doesn't really matter, this is a good game for you. BUT, IF YOU DO PLAN ON PLAYING BURIAL AT SEA I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU PLAY THE FIRST TWO, BUT IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD BOTH AT LEAST PLAY THE FIRST. If you don't even play the first, the plot will go straight over your head. But in conclusion, I think this a fantastic addition to the already terrific Bioshock series. Do buy. Do play.
