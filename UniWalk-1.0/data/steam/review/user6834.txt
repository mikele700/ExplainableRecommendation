love this game if you are a person how likes strategys this is one of the my personal fav is etw and rtw 2 but this one is still the best ancient era it is lake a mixture of civ 5 and age of empire and the auto resolve make the game soo much better (empire total wars auto resolve wasn't that good) and the greek pack makes every thing better (if you like greeks that is) so i servely remmound (and i would'nt call the grand campain accurate)
i've played most of the air simulators and most of them never appiled to me as much as this on did
same poop same backet with a diffrent label on the fron....
awesome
GRATE GAME!!!!!
if you like creepy, scary, mystery, adventure and extiment games then this is really good for you and good graphics good animation not extremly scary just mainly jump scares
awesome game remmand it very much because a very rich story line (mind you i love AC) but i do love french so a bit bad that they made the french the main bad guys becausew the spanish where more into slavery than the french where talking about 1700's but still very good game
