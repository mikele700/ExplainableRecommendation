Enjoyable cover based shooter. Modern Warfare meets Gears of War. Loved this game from the minute I played the demo years ago, although took me a while to actually buy it. Wish there was more of it, great ride...quite serious themes of war/death. The book 'The Heart of Darkness' was used as inspiration for the game. Probably going to play it again on Fubar difficulty.
AWESOME Game! Totes different to 1.6 and Source, but HEAPS of fun none the less, I can see myself sinking hours into this.
