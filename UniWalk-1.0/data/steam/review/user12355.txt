I never got into any Mortal Kombat games before and I decided this would be the one. Of the 5 or so hours I played I thoroughly enjoyed it and was looking forward to putting many hours into it. I was especially excited to hear about KP2 and the GGPO netcode fix coming only to discover today directly from NRS' mouth that they are dropping support for PC. If this decision was based on WB's perceived notion that they wouldn't make a profit off the PC player base currently the irony is that fixing the netcode I'm sure would have brought back many players who in turn may have bought KP2 and any future DLC. I'm glad I only paid $15 for the game and that they didn't get any of that money. I will not buy any of WB or NRS games again. Vote with your wallet if you don't want this to happen again to the PC community.EDIT: The more I play MKX the more I love it but I wonder if continually playing it and building my skills is worth it in a game that for a lack of a better metaphor, has effectively had it's throat cut and is slowly bleeding to death.
