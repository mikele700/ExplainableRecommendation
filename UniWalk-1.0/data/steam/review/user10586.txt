Terraria... where can i start...Firstly, if you havent already heard of it it-'s a 2d sandbox game with RPG elements. Some say it-'s -2D Minecraft-. They are stupid. This game isnt even close to Minecraft, far more loot and armor and much less emphasis on building. A must have game. 10/10. Go on, what are you doing! Go and buy it now!
-Started wid a Gibus now we-'re here-Seriously. It becomes more than an FPS when you get a premium account.BEST GAME EVER
Before I bought KAG, it been looking at it for a long hile on youtube and I thought it would be AMAZING, but although it is still good, it's not AS good as i thought originally, so still a good game.
