I played on TAnd just thought...♥♥♥♥ da police
I love this game. It was awesome when I started playing and Kabam keeps making things better and better. The biggest faults I have with this game are lag and Realm gold. With the addition of the mystery boxes and the alchemist, as well as the items being sold in the nexus, new players started buying items and becoming great players, without putting any real time in the game.But that being said, it's still a great game. I love playing mystic with it's new buffs, and the update just proves Kabam's actually thinking about the game. So all in all, This is a game definately worth playing.
