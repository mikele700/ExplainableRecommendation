Have you ever found a game, That literally just gives you so many good feels, then rips them from you and tears you to pieces, Before building you back up again? This game has so many feels, It is literally the best game I have ever played. I didnt want to stop playing once I started, And going through the game I was assaulted by a army of feels that tried to make me happy, sad, shocked, amazed and overall - CONTENT with the experience I had.(Even though I still wish for more)
Ive played not very much of it, The gameplays pretty good but what got me hooked was the amount of detail in the story. You have to notice alot to read it but damn.. Theres alot. People rage debate over what could be right or wrong about their ideas. 10/10 mysterious.
