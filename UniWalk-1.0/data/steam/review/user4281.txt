The best game. there is nothing else to say
Best fallout
Heaps of fun with friends and randoms, Great game !
Love it so far!PROs:                   CONs:-free build             -mini missions get annoying (but theyre optional)-no handholding-immersive OST-Doesn't take itself seriously -Boss fights are actually hard and intense-weapons do not feel over or under powered-easy to lose 5 hours and not realise it -Can create your Base HQ on any planet -Main story seems intersting so farIn summery: i cannot beleive a game built around 8-bit graphics has me so immersed(Sucks to be No Mans Sky)
Awesome game, awesome story and awesome visuals. Although the acheivments stop working halfway through the game :(but it doesnt matter still well worth the money
