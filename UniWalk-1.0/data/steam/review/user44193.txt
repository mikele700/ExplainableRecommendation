An excellent little game that should take between an hour to an hour and a half to finish.  It's a fairly simple puzzle game that goes from quite simple to complicated (at around level 37 if you're playing and wondering when its going to get hard) (insert obligatory ♥♥♥♥♥ joke here). Very nice game that you should definitely drop a buck on. The puzzles are very intriguing in a 'if I press a button, how do I only move what I want' and are usually quite challenging in a neat way. Some of the later levels get a little convoluted and I found myself having more problems understanding the puzzle than I did solving it. All the mechanics are simple to understand and typically have one introduced every 4 levels or so, apart from one point where you have 2 more difficult mechanics introduced in following levels which is when the difficulty ramps up, would've like 3 or 4 levels inbetween to truly make the most out of each,Only a few small things that affect gameplay in no way. First, theres no menu or ability to edit noise volume (that I saw anyway). The music is nice, but I would've preferred just to have rainymood.com going in background. Secondly, a Level selection option seems mandatory in a game like this, but the only option is to go through levels one by one, even if it is a single playthrough sort of game it can be exasperating, I was hoping to look back on simpler times by level 46 and found I'd have to go level by level, no thanks.Well worth the slight thinking induced haze im in right now9/10, buy this game its only a dollar
Great game, and an awesome example of rogue-like games, would be much better with more modding tools available.
:D Love this game
