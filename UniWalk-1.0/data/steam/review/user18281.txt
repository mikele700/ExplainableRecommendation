This is one of the best FPS games I've ever played. Even though it is a freemium game, it is not as obnoxious about all the things you can buy with real money in it as other freemium games. It won't trap you, and it is not Pay-to-Win. Sure there are items that are really overkill in some areas, but it has quite a lot of consequences in other areas too. The game is beautifully balanced.Even though I personally have used real money to buy a few things, it's not the items that makes you win, but how well you use what you have - I have had level 12 players beat me when I was using the items that I've payed to get. So I highly recommend that players who are a bit cautious about freemium games, jump into this one, because it's unlike any other that you've played before.
