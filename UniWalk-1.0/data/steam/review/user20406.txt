Played as America and made them Jewish 13/10
This game is actually beautiful, looks amazing, plays smooth on my rig plus the ai aren't complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s if it goes on sale I highely reccomend it as I believe $39 for the steam version (AU) is a bit too much. Also with the steam workshop content the things that can be added to this game is crazy, another positive is that it doesn't require the base game Shogun 2 to play!Reccomend/10
Though it may be a bit old Total War: Rome is still and amazing RTS title and relatively cheap for the addicting hours that you can put into it, there's also some great mods such as darthmod which add so much into the gameMultiplayer is still and alive and some pretty interesting battles take place, no co-op unfortunetly but, it is 6-8 years old. The historical battles are a blast and some of the mods add more and even build upon pre existing historical battles such as the Battle of Tutenberg Forest from Darthmod itself Highely reccomend!
If you were to describe this game to a song it would be Getting Better - The BeatlesFantastic development, the addition of workshop adds double the fun!Well worth $15AUD
Had a 99% chance to hit my target from point blank.Misses.11/10 would shoot again
Looks great, lots of fun in co-op and many different heists and ways to performs heists. This game will keep you busy for a long time, especially if you have friends who have it.Highely reccomend it.
I'm really over people complaining they have either been scammed or that they have wasted their money in purchasing this. The store gives plenty of warning and even Rocket himself has his own reccomendation into purchasing the Early-access Alphahttp://forums.dayzgame.com/index.php?/topic/155089-is-it-worth-buying-dayz-standalone-yet-rocket-response/ Not to mention buy making this purchase you will not have to pay anymore for this game you will have it for life and all the updates included which will pick up after Christmas/New Years, plus the price will increase later down the devlopment path (that will be awhile away however).Personally, I think that as an alpha release it worked quite smoothly, only real issues that affect me personally are the lack of zombies and respawning of loot, which are going to be fixed very soon which makes the player engagement strong in this game at the moment, I mean what else is there to do? Holding people up, force feeding them, cuffing them and shooting and breaking their legs or leaving them to bleed out or if you're not that much of an ♥♥♥♥ instead interact and help other players who knows you might even make some new friends :)Running off the Take on Helicopters engine which is pretty much between Arma 2 and Arma 3 the game looks beautiful and in my opinion performs more smoother than the mod I've read alot about people experiencing major performance issues on killer rigs but I know later they are looking into optimising and making the game run better for everyone which is understandable I play on medium to high with my 660 and i5 3570k and 8Gb ram I get around 20-30 in major cities and 50-70 in other areas of course it's not entirely stable but it's playable to say the leastOverall if you've played the Arma 2 mod you may find playing this game alot easier with past experience and might be a bit of a struggle for new players, despite that there is plenty of tutorials online and probably through the discussion in the steam community if you're willing to dig through a bunch of cry babies and their ignorant comments but yeah if you have some friends who have this I guarantee you will have a great safer and probably more confident in moving around and doing thingsWith the open world there's plenty to explore until the lack of content is improved - but hey it's alpha for gods sake :PI reccomend 10/10
Prison Simulator 201413/10 would tunnel out of prison with spoons again.Worth a drop 80% off get itttt
I can drive around Europe listening to real European stations.Winning.
This game just disgusts me, one major issue I have with it is the respawn timeDo not buy.
