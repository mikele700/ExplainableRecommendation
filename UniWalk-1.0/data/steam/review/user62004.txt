Do you want cancer? No? Then don't buy this game.
EVER WANTED TO BE A FLYING ALIEN NINJA GUNSLINGER GUY? NO? WELL THIS IS FOR YOU!
EDIT:  If you want me to give my honest opinion, I don't mind the game itself, apart getting extremely boring on the early nights it has a pretty creative storyline, gives a good scare and has a bit of strategy to it.The thing that murdered it? The fandom.I won't go too in-depth but basically the fandom is absolutely horrendous and shares too much in common with the Minecraft fandom.Gameplay: 6/10Fandom 4/10A simple game with a good concept... that got ruined by hundreds of thousands of little children. gg
