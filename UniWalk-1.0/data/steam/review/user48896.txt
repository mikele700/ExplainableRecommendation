The most unfinished, unballenced, glitchiest game since battlefield 4. When they say -Early Access- they litterally mean that jack ♥♥♥♥ works. I spent two hours grinding for wood, built a log cabin and was about to place the final TWO blocks of the ninety required, and suddenly some mutants randomly spawned infront of me, killing me instantly.Overall i would rate this game a 2/10 the only reason its two and not motherf*cking 0, is that it lets you slap mutants with their own f*cking arms.This game is NOT worth $14.99 in its current stage and should not be on steam. In my opinion this Early Access game realease  is comparable to the release of -The War Z- Or -infestation: survivor stories- as it was renamed.The developers of both these games should have thought long and hard before releasing such a sh*tty unfinished game onto steam, and valve themselves should be ashamed to have this in their library.To sum up this review, You should SERIOUSLY do some solid research before purchasing this. At the time i purchased it you could not even save the game, which was not clearly stated ANYWHERE on the store page and was clearly a gigantic flaw. I realise this has now been adressed and in future perhaps the many flaws in this game will be, however in its current state it is unplayable unless all you wish to do is slash mutants appart and build trophies out of there body parts, or atttempt to go swimming and end up flying above the entire map (Because F*ck logic). This game was advertised as a REALISTIC SURVIVAL GAME. Im not sure about you, but i dont consider walking over a rock and suddenly falling to the ground dead realistic, however if thats what floats your boat i suppose this game would be an excelent buy.
Pretty good game, need a beastly computer to play it though
