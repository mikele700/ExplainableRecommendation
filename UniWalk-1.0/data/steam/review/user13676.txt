Yes, it is true that there are some technical difficulties with the PC port of this game but I've actually managed to run this game almost flawlessly with my GTX970 (I thouroughly enjoyed it). If you are a Batman fan and have played all the previous Batman Arkham games, then this game is definitely worth the price of admission once it get's discounted in one of Steams Christmas sales at 75% off, which it is then, most definitely worth the price of admission.
-I really like the game, but I couldnâ€™t find the stupid cake.-
