amazing game!when I first bought this game, I thought I had lost my money to some crap game, but as I got more into it, I figured it was well worth it and now I am hooked, not in a bad way though. The graphics have so many effects and the game play has a wide range of things you can do, from taking 60 mins lost in your world perfecting ships or going through worm hole after worm hole looking for other players ships to fight.97% of the people like it any ways, that's a review itself
Ring runner has one of the best visuals for it's genre, highly entertaining and incredibly good value for money. The only downside is the small playerbase, otherwise a stunning game and highly reccomended.
Stunning graphics, combat and contant updates is what this game boasts.
With 400 hours of play, I do reccomend.
