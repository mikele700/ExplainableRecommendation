I would highly reccommend no more room in hell to anyone who enjoys an FPS, Horror, Action or survival. With ailments such as infection and bleeding, and other such things, makes this not only one of the best, but also the most realistic, zombie themed games ever made.
i would reccomend this game for older kids that are older then 12 because u will want your kids to sleep and u dont want them to rade Lol.
the best f2p game ever ,3
Awesome game 
awesome game.
awesome game but the only bad thing is its the same as tf2 but just re-skin of characters. so im putting it as a thumbs down. sorry for the people who like it.
