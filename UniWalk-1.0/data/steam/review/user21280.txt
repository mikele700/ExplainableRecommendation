All aspects of this game are just amazing, the game is easy to catch on to and there's a lot of flexibility in gameplay. The graphics are terrific and you can make a deck to suit your type of gameplay. In most games, it's Free-To-Play but you need to pay money to ultimatley progress, however, this game is unique and only quickens the progress of obtaining good cards. However, if you have good cards at an early level, you may encounter expeirenced players online more earlier in the game, so in all honesty, it's not recommended. This game is addiction and fun and can be played for hours on end. The game is less than 1GB in storage (811 MB to be precise) and is quick and easy to download. I recommend this to anybody who likes free games, honestly.
