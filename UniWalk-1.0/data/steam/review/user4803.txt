Owned my server and played  1002 Hours on Rust now called -rust legacy- compared to the new & improved  -RUST- I call it rust detrimental it has ruined it for all rust fans. The new -RUST- is nowhere enjoyable -'some work & some don-'t..?in question it-'s totally screwed to allow a transition like rust to completely switch from good gameplay to looking for a barrel for a couple of hours.The gameplay may be smooth but that-'s about it.I could go on but consider the so many fans out there who still like -'rust legacy-' im sure your one of them..keep on keeping on.P.S. Will have to update my server...really...not
Recommended Game of the Year..Awesome in every sense..I liked it
