Extremely pay to win.  Lv 1-2 is great, hit Lv 3 and your in on giant maps with the tank spam and wallet hero weapons.

Panzer/bazooka rocket ammo like 800 credits per shot, with 2-4k per match, killing all those tanks pretty much ensures you cannot progress towards any better guns.tl;dr: Cash for power.
