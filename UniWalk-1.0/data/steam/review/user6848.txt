whenever i play portal 2, i reach a certain time of gameplay, then it freezes the screen! the only to stop it is by ending the task through task manager =( still prettyh fun though.. ive even tried installing and uninstalling again and again, to no avail....
scribblenauts.. haha ! the game is damn fun ! basically, you have this magical book and whenever u write something in it, it becomes real life (not everything) highly recommended if you have an imaginative mind and a playful mind too
