In this game the ranking will murder you, for example your in a silver elite game and you rank up then play another and you suck because you are silver elite master, guys welcome to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
Well this game has it all: Gore, sex, good story line, swords, crossbows and Nvidia hair physics (Jokes it is kind of useless, just kills 20 frames - fps). Good game actually very good, clocked up to 30 hours playing like 6 hours a day. One problem with it but it may be hard to run considering I have a GTX 760 and get 40 - 50 frames on low and medium settings but the game still looks good at low and medium settings.
Really great game with much potential but holding back on it is all the bugs and glitches. Great game otherwise and a great port.
This is not a guns blazing game because you will die as much as going fists only on skyrim on legendary. Just get the game if you know what your doing otherwise *Wasted* (GTA V reference)
It is a damn good game.
This game is really good but it is too much of a mess right now, it would be wise to wait for it to get less buggy. I was loving this game but all of a sudden when about to play the game it ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥ on me and says nope your playing 30fps now and I spent hours searching for an answer and tried everythimg I possibly could but no luck.
Positive things:Simple yet fun gameNot many controls making it easy to playFun with friendsGets very hardAdictiveVery cheap (I got it for 50c on a sale ;) )Negitive things:Small mapNeeds more varity of structuresNeeds more varity of maps rahter than the one gray map
This is what Payday 2 is:I was told to rob a bank and survive, and what happened; friends screaming at me, cops belting everyone.IT IS A GREAT GAME FOR A BEEFY COMPUTER REMEMBER THAT!!! 9.5/10 -AI a little bad
