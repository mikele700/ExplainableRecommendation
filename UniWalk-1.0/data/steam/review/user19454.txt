It's like pure Nintendo games in FPS form. It works strangely well. I strongly recommend to anyone who likes challenging FPS games and can appreciate the subtle humour in the art design.
The people who made this game can count to 3. 10/10.(Also it's really fun if you like meaty FPS's)

Probably the closest thing you'll get to Smash Bros for PC. Pretty good art quality and and very amusing humor.Great game to play with a controller in Big Picture mode.
