If you plan to play this in any country other than North America (Where the Main Server is located, wait... the ONLY server is located) then i suggest don't play the game.Constant server disconnects, dropping connection, the list goes on.The controls feel like you're driving a sluggish passenger ferry and there's no individuality that the game has to offer. Steel Ocean doesn't set itself apart from any other Naval Strategy game apart from adding submarines which is the main factor i downloaded the game in the first place.Graphics are decent and the controls are alright i suppose. But i suggest if you want to play a fun, enjoyable and immersive game. Either wait a year for the game to get some major updates or move onto similar games like WoWS (World of War Ships) if you are looking for something a little more immersive.I currently have about an hour and i can already tell it's Pay2Win, and the tech tree isn't complete on many sides/countries.
So good a game that it's in the Winter Sales as 75% off even know it's Free... If that doesn't explain anything, then what will.
