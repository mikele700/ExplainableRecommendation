My hours show the love for this game r8 10/10 m8
Not worth $60. In my opinion get this game if its $20 or under.
I really like this game but theres one major problem.... the servers are so laggy. If just to load a chunck takes around 30 seconds and by the time its loaded you would of probably died from an enemy hitting you and you cant do anyhthing back because your stuck loading. This gets me so frustrated when the hour quests are on... Getting from dungeon to dungeon takes way to long and I am usually a few points off the reward when the time runs out or get disconnected.As I said this game has a lot of potential but just remeber you will get frustrated from lag.
Only played 1 hour of the game and can already tell im going to be putting in many more.
