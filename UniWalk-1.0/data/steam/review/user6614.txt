Payday is a very nice game and all but the gunplay lacks in the way of sensitivity and user friendlyness, when I was a lower level I could not aim the carbine unless the guy was directly infront of me so I went with the pistol because it waqs accurate and easy to use compared to the terrible iron sites. The AI are decent but at times they can pull some fancy tricks to catch you with your pants down (in normal difficulty). Unfortunantly, to my annoyance, there are only a couple of levels that allow for stealth approaches (whats the point of surpressed weapons), and that the stealth sections were badly made, splutter splutter diamond hiest, and the friedly ai dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about stealth.I found that the game is great if you liked L4D2 and like L4D2 it is largely based on teamwork but it is the best to play if you have a crew with all your mates in it. Dont freak if you dont have a mic and most of all get a bunch of mates and do OVERDRILL, it the best way to level up. 9/10
