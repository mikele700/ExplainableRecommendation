Great game, very derpy at times. I really enjoy this game and if you get it, I think you would like it aswell :]
Overall a really good game. My only problem is the amount of russians, and squeakers in matchmaking. 9/10.
Great game. I would 10/10 like to ♥♥♥♥ calradia again. Lots of mods, and 2 amazing DLC's for you to play. Graphics may not be the best, but the gameplay is amazing, and getting a kill is satisfying, even if it's only a peasant. 69/10. Amazing game
