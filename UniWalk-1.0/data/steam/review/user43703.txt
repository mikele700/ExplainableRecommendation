My opinion of Pros and Cons of the game so far.Pros:- Old school D&D style true to the core.- Loot changes your abilities- Shops to purchase more cool gear.- The adventure so far doesnt seem like a grind, but is intriguing and fun.- Can play single player,coop, or against other players.- The game is setup like it would be if you had the board game.Cons:- Can be deemed as Pay to win.(although multiplayer sets you up against people of similar gear sets)- To get a good start, it can be hard if you dont pay to be a member ($19.95)- Can't have more then 3 classes/characters at one time.
I haven-'t Played it for very long compared to other people on here, but for a free game it has a mobile phone charm to it. It hooks you in with its simple mechanics, and the greed of men causes you to forever want more and not accept -angel investors- too early.Pro-'s:MoneyMore MoneyEven More MoneyAngels that give More MoneyCons:Not enough MoneyAlways want More Money7pm ->Million -> Billion -> trillion -> quadrillion.... -> 3am.in all its a great distraction and i give it a nice 7/10Beware it is extremely addictive.
I liked this game so much that the 6.2hrs played was from the day that i bought it.. yesterday!this game is soo much fun and has alot of promise and potential. i love how it is so basic to use but at the same time it can be extremely exhillerating when you make some massive evil seige contraption of death just to kill 10 guys. Only cons i can think of was that there is no tutorial on what each item does, some items like ball joint and such i dont know what to use for. i guess if i look at other peoples online i can see how to use them, but i'd like to see some sort of a demonstration with each part with maybe a voice over. that would be great.keep up the good work.
