-Needs more Void Wall-Amazing fun in co-op, great base game, runs well on my 3 year old alienware laptop, plus adds great combo-'s in killing enemies, especially with physics.9/10 No Elsa skin for Enchantress
What can I say? Payday was a solid staple game for my friends for about 5-6 years. We all preordered the criminal career edition, and had a blast. I even stuck through it when a bug deleted my entire save af about 3-6 months work. Now, ♥♥♥♥ it. It even isn't worth it on a free weekend. Reddit had made jokes ironically about us becoming the next TF2, or the next CS:GO, and now that it's here, I think it was the final straw. This has made me incredibly sad, to see one of the game studio's I admire to sink so low.For those out of the loop, anfd want a basic overview of why there is so much outrage, Overkill have ♥♥♥♥ed the weapons up to make shotguns more than twice as weak as pistols, and added skins you get from 'safes' which you open with 'drills' for 2.49, that give stat boosts.{Edit}Figured I'd edit this review now, especially given whats happened. Now, drills and safes are free. Now that everything is attainable without spending money outside of DLC, I feel like I can recommend this game again.
