I ran with my rifle, and died.8/8 IGN-
WARNING!only buy this if you want to play singleplayer!dont bother with multiplayer because its just way to hard to work out.if your browsing for servers on the web, they dont give you the username or password to the server making it impossible to join. It might be a personal problem and im stupid, but if you know how it works, please tell me!over all, great game!(for singleplayer)
The life of a slice of bread who's sole wish is to become toast. Which would be fine if the things he needed to get toasted on were not on the other side of the room.An amazing adventure/physics/simulator that will engage you for hours of flopping a slice of bread around the room in funny ways.12/10
uuuuh. controls please?EDIT:they added controls, but i still cant play because i have no friendssure its a great game otherwise!
