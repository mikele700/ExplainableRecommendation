Man, I will NEVER forget the Pacman song! This game has a lot you can change thus making it fun for everyone! It keeps you entertained all the time with its funky music and awesome visuals!
If you like minecraft or The legend of Zelda, you will LOVE Terraria.It's Like minecraft but on crack!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Many Bosses to defeat and a wide range of weapons and armour. (You can dress up as Link!)Highly recommend this game. 10/10 
For a free MMORPG this game is great! Its membership does not offer much and is not needed to keep this game fun for hours! only issue is that there is a lot of grinding to keep your levels up. If you keep doing the missions then no problem!! Partying it as fun as ever and a wide range of classes to choose from. This game really tries to make you learn boss patterns and tactics.very fun overall.note that this takes quite a while to download so be prepared!

Very good game overall, was surprised when I put my username in it unlocked a Zelda icon and that was really cool XD. The game can be a bit depressing but fun overall XD, worth the time to complete it !
