I would have started this review with a recomendation but turns out the automatic banning system they have set up is flawed online. I recieved an automatic ban until the end of the year while I throwing grenades at police helicopters. Disputed it, explained my story and asked for a reason for the ban. My post was edited to -This is a complaint about ban-, responded with an automatic message explaining that they have an automatic banning system in place and the terms of use then deleted a day later. Tired asking again, demanded a reason for the ban. I then got an email that my account is now flagged for breaching terms of use. I wish there was a way to get my damn money back because they can apparently ban you without notice or reason. Not happy >:(TL;DROnline mode monitored by a flawed automatic ban hammer and will never get reviewd or get a response that isn-'t a pre-typed message
