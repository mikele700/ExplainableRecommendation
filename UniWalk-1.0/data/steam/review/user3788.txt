This game is quite frustrating, mainly due to the fact that you often do not have control over your own demise nor enough vision on the surrounding environment. Instant-death traps are often just off-screen but fire as soon as you see them (not giving you enough time to dodge), damage is dealt by cheap hidden enemies, and you very often take fall damage as it is difficult to judge where you will land (again, due to the limited vision).If the camera was zoomed out just a little, this might be a much better game - as it is, I would not recommend it, even to fans of roguelike platformers.
