Absolutely brilliant! Played the second one and this one is a major improvement. Great story line and characters, and brilliant scenery. 10/10
Best game ever
BEST GAME EVER!!!
THIS GAME IS UNBELIEVABLE, A MUST HAVE IF YOU LOVE THE SERIES
Great Game. A hell of a ride.
THIS IS FRICKING AWESOME.......nuff said
Great game, graphics remind me of borderlands. Reading most of the negative comments before i got this game, most people haven-'t recommended this game for 1 reason...the -matchmaking-. I don-'t see the problem i have no trouble finding a match. In case you -negative people-, who are against this game, haven-'t notice have you tried moving closer to your modem or internet source when matchmaking. I only have 3 bars on internet and i-'ve had no proble in the matchmaking session. Guys this is a really good game, you won-'t be disappointed.
looks epic
Being a game that takes up 15gb of storage, downloading it was slow. Although, this is a epic game especially if you are a fan of rpg's.
