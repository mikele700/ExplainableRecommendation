This is simply one of the best games i played.It has everything and i do mean EVERYTHING.Murder,a jackass villain,replayability.when you first actualy play this game,you just cant stop,the amount of side quests is INSANE.Plus you can play the game 32-bit so you wont really have prolems playing it.Another good thing about it is that there are 4 classes,each one unique in its own way.Axton:sentry turret,Maya:phaselock,Salvador:gunzerking,Zero:Deception?
