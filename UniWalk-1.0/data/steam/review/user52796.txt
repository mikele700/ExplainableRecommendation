FEELS THE SAME as the first one
Would Recommend if you love updates that ruin the game complety and make the doors un-openable.It used to be good then it turned to ♥♥♥♥....
Pretty fun....and hard.
Would recomend if you like to fly on Log Sled's.
10/10 Would get rid of Australia Server Again!
Awesome
This is funy
good oneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Pros -Good Graphics (For the time)-Fun to steal cars and kill innocent civilans without going to Jail Cons-Runs Horribly no matter what PC you have-Car driving is hardSpent most of time trying to get the game working or the mods installed...6/10Would recommend if like game's that take forever to work.
