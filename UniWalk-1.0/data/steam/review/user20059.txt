i found this game very enjoyable buuut when i got 2cnd in the world the 1st was a guy who obviously hacked(he had 5Xall the other people) the worst part is that you dont get cheivs if you enter in a different name to your steam name but aswell money is absaloutly useless other then revives witch i dont use much... if there was differently shaped tubes that would also be more fun and if you get past 1300 there is just endless yellow which didnt help make you want to go thurther
with great cartoonish elements this funny game has so many collectables and lovable characters you can play for years
this game is quite fun but it is quite moneygrabbing to do anything other then just the default game after already paying for it
