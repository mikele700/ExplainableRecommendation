-=SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW=-If you have got patience, a passion for physics games and a great computer, then you should be able to enjoy this game.Octodad: Dadliest Catch wasn-'t one of the usual games I play. At the start we open with controlling Octodad, as you will throughout the game. This was one of the easiest sections in the game. Finding bowties, opening doors, and throwing objects at glass panes. It was a great way to do a tutorial, but as you walked down the carpet towards your bride, it became difficult. -Don-'t let people notice you-'re an Octopus.- And by doing so, you had to avoid breaking things. And after each level there was the small chase with Octodad and The Chef. While running you-'d have to continuously switch between leg and arm control as you moved objects out of your path. After mastering the switch the game starts to flow easier.Later on the game became progressively harder with it-'s challenges, such as the obstacle course in the aquarium. Moving across unstable platforms with lag was quite a tricky challenge, so I had to experience the game with my graphics set low. Also some people might notice the game glitching now and then. Items would mysteriously tear apart when you tried to grab them, or they-'d get stuck in walls. It-'s a good little game, sad to see it finish so soon. The script was funny. I purposely took long periods of time to hear what some of the people had to say. . -This is scarier than an ocean full of spiders. . And Tommy!- -Dad, if you left me here, fish would adopt me!- I also really enjoyed the story line, which it-'s always good to have a nice story line for your game. So when you look past the glitches, the challenges and the odd physics with the default settings, It-'s actually a rather good game. Just I recommend the game for people who have good patience.
