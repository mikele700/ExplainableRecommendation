Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first-person shooter game, multiplayer is a major part of the game as there is really no story involved but it's one of those games you can play from time to time for enjoyment to let off some steam maybe. Casual is a nice way to enhance your skill cap and to get better game sense and knowledge, the competitive aspect of this game is really reliant on teamwork, communication and skill which is why I really enjoy playing this with friends which is recommended. To get to the point, yes I recommend this game if you enjoy playing teamwork-reliant, competitive games by yourself or with friends.
