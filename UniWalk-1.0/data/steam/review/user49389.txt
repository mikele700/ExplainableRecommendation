spectacular game! but the down fall of the game is the new health systom where when you die your health is at the minimum not like DARK SOULS I and II where each time you die you loose little by little and then you use a humanity to regain it all back. but in this it has a default health set for when you go undead. another downfall is the servers are still ♥♥♥♥ and makes it hard to summon players. but over all the game is amazing to play!!
Grate and fun game to play!!
