Nice game. Like Guacamelee (Which is probably derived from Metroidvania originally). Really nice graphics.Flaws: Slightly repeditive music; No fast-travel; Some mini-boss levels (Usually ending in a race of some sort) can't be revisited once you're through them (No 100% if you don't get things first-time through).
I kept waiting for it to suck... It never did... and THEN some!
Is Good!Has the teenage angst + mystery feel of Twin Peaks and Veronica Mars (Minus the humour of the latter!)... plus a time-travel schtick!With very atmospheric visuals and music.
This is a tight little platformer with cool style.Highly enjoyable.
