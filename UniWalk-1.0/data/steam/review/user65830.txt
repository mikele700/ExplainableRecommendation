The game is quite good but it needs more potential, more atmoshpere and maybe add the option to run aswell your protagonist moves extremely slow and your first objective takes hours to complete and the map seems quite large for beginners, where do we even know where to go? The brightness for this game is very low making the player struggle to see, the flashlight isn't as bright infact it's brightness is very low, the weather and biome make it very difficult to see, sure the games free but needs improvment the game is quite glitchy and buggy making the gameplay very difficult your sensitivity is low and the graphics are very bad and require improvment aswell the games atmosphere isn't great and i expected to meet into your antagonist aka Slenderman while doing your first objective the games making it like Slender isn't even included it just reveals the vandilism he's caused ,it's difficult to find him infact he doesn't even make an appearence in the game that much as said it just reveals the vandilism he's caused, in conclusion to make this game better it just needs some tweaks and improvments to advance it's gameplay a little.
