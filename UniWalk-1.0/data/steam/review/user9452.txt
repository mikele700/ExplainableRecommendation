NOTE: This is an early access review. will review again after full release.I am a fan of this genre of games, I have spent many hours of my life on 2d sandboxes and edge of space is no different.Edge of space has all of it's own ideas and artwork which I like and I also like all of the little references to other games and things in everyday life. I haven't had much of a chance to play it but the time I have spent on edge of space has been well enjoyed, Edge of Space is definetly worth it.10/10 love it :)
I was plaing this before when it was in alpha and beta and it is a good buy i highly recomend it you will have lots of fun
