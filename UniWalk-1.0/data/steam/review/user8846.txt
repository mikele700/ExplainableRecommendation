I only just got this game, have played 3.2 hours as of making this review, I enjoy the game, I've gotten to the level cap with Ruby and Blake. I would recomend you wait till the full game is released to buy it, but hey, that's just me
Goes all in with the best hand in the gameLoses because Ash happens to have one higher card10/10 would get destoryed by a rigged system again
I like the game, I just wish it had servers located in other parts of the world besides US and EU, like for example, an oceanic server would be great for players from Japan, Australia, New Zealand, etc. Then they wouldn't have to join other servers and experience lag and teleporting in certain areas of the world.
This game makes no sense, every time you have a good pair, the bots always have something 10x better, you finally get a good card, everyone folds on the first round.0/10 would smash my montior into peices again
Don't play it, not even for the free hats.

WARNING OPINION IMCOMINGThis game could be better if the community wasn't so toxic over one player using one different item and the gods were actually balanced to the point where you could vs a team and not get stomped because you have a team full of randoms I'm surprised people like that in a game (I understand if you're the one doing it, its fun)
*finds quote on a wall*-There are no songs written about the wars between Abraxis and the demon Ulixsteracktus. Ever tried to rhyme Ulixsteracktus?-*Stands there and tries to read the names for about 10 minutes**dies by one of those small clockwork suicide bombers*10/10
This game isn't fun anymore, its just hackers, smurfs, boosters and trolls (at least in Australia), I wouldn't recommend anyone to play this game, I've played 300+ hours and have hated the last week of playing it. If you do decide to play this game, be prepared to lose to smurfs, hackers and deranking teammates. Worst Community 10/10
