The Collider 2 is quite a fun, addicting reflex based 'endless' experience. Though as to be expected with recent releases, there is a plethora of bugs and issues with the menu system; from options not triggering any changes within the game, to purchases not updating within in the store and achievements not being unlocked, this game needs some serious refinement before it is worth it's $10 asking price. The actual gameplay itself is really well made and a lot of fun, if you can look past these issues present within the rest of the game, it is a good way to pass the time, that's if the game continues to give you xp for completing missions, in my case, I'm stuck at the same level forever now. Yay.
Payday 2 is an action packed, full on co-op experience that works wonders when it all comes together (A very rare occurence) When you're not fighting the nigh on useless team ai to assist in any way other than their designated role as meatshield, or the drill which has a nasty tendency to break down every other second, or the hacker infested community that kicks at the drop of a hat, the game is actually quite a bit of fun.Pros-Rich co-op based experience that provides hours of funImmersive gameplayProvides skills necessary to fix drills and throw bagsMake new friends (Who subsequently kick you once they see your reputation)Cons-Terrible aiHarsh communityDLC cash cowToo many pointless bonus charactersMicrotransactionsPointless tutorial that doesn't cover even the very basicsOccassional hitbox glitchesI've played this game for over 400 hours since it's release in 2013, while it's not the best game out there, it keeps me and my crew entertained. Buy only if you have friends to play with or you are willing to put up with the dodgy team ai.Get this while it's on sale, only a few of the DLC are really essential to enjoy the game, the rest are all pointless cosmetics that are overpriced.
Used to be an absolutely amazing game on the 360. Magnitudal piece of trash here though; the appalling tyranny of Games for Windows Live knows no bounds. Ruining game after game even years after their release.
