Once you get a hand of the controls this game is surprisingly addictive, it can be a little tedious at times but overall its worth the money and my son loves the big trucks in the mud. There is always a soft place in my heart for Russian machinery and this fills it :)If you enjoy Beam.NG for it crash physics, you will enjoy this for its mud physics... if only I could combine the two...
