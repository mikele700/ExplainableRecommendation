Br√ºtal Legend is fantastic! As a metal fan myself, I'm totally into the focus on metal music throughout the game. Jack Black does a fantastic job at giving life to the character Eddie, and the appearance of Ozzie Osbourne is very amusing too. Full of action (the gore option is hilarious) and great comedic dialogue. Awesome game, would totally recommend to anyone with a metal edge or a fan of Jack Black's!
