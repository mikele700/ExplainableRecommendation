Beautiful! Definitely worth the money (although I got it on sale). Amazing music, I love it! Fits the game perfectly, but after playing it I enjoy the music by itself almost as much.
Fantastic game; the multiplayer is tricky 2 set up, but once it is... it's probably 1 of the best games around 4 intense friendly retro gaming. I love it, & it's beyond a doubt worth buying.
