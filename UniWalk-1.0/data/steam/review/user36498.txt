So let me start off by saying I got this in a bundle and thought -Why the hell not? It could be fun right?-. Skip forward about six months, got 1.5 hours of gameplay and my friend asked me if he should get it for some multiplayer action. My response was -Why dont we go jump in a pit of fire and burn to death, it would be just as fun-. But seriously I didn-'t enjoy this and here is my list of pros and consPros-Large expansive maps with lots of people which could be fun-The graphics can be nice if you don-'t look at the textures to closelyCons-Game starts you off with a very poorly done tutorial that can teleport you every place you don-'t need to be. I had to noclip to escape some of places I was thrown into-The tutorial is also confusing and frustrating if it decides to work-Even after the tutorial I still had hope maybe the rest of the gameplay was differenand less glitchy and sometimes confusing, the game was littered with latency issues as well as the forementioned issues that appeared in the tutorial-Also to me the gameplay felt like it was just trying to board the success of other modern FPS-'All in all this game was a disappointing which is saying something cause I went in with 0 expectation. It felt unfinished and like a rip-off of an already overdone concept.
