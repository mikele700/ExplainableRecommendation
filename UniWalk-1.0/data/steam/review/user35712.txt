really well done game, lots of fun weith friends but the only think that was a dissapointment would have to be that the graphics didn't change from the last payday but still is a great game to play.
Spooky
This game was full of drama and never ending twists. It was a fairly long game but it was worth every hour. A highly recommended game to play.
Pretty KEWL game. Needs more titttayyyssss. But seriously its a very well done game with lots of mods to play around with. 10/10.
This has proven to be an outstanding war game. Plenty of day's to roam around the streets searching for loot and people to kill. A highly recommended game to play.
I highly recommed this for its never ending drama in the storyline and its never ending twists. 10/10 would finger bang again
This game would have to be one of my top played games of all time, i have spent many hours on this game and it never gets old. I suggest that everyone buys it.
This game is so fun and packed with adventurist things to do, that when i finished the game i was so upset because there was still so much to do around the open world. I highly recommend you buy this game and i personally think Assassins Creed Black Flag is ten times more funner than the past Assassins Creeds. You will not be disappointed. :D
This game will keep you entertained for hours. Its fun for the whole family.
i can't even begin the tell how much i love this master piece of a game
