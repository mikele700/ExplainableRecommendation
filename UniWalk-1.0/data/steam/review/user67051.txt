_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-Half life.The game that started it all.Even though it was made back in 1998,it is still a gem.I don-'t vote games by their graphics,but by their gameplay.This was an immersing,wonderful and addicting experience for me.I lived another life.In this game.The game has everything a gamer asks for: Immersing Gameplay,Indulging story,A Nice Selection of Weapons,and graphics that were thrilling in the year it was made,but are all old now.Even now this title holds up till today,shining its glory as the first game that Valve ever made,and a game that changed Gaming itself.Now I will have a look at the main aspects of a good game.WARNING: A little bit of spoiling ahead.Gameplay: Excellent.Either you are blasting monsters from an alternate dimension or just trying to pick off those squad men who just don-'t seem to put you in peace.There were a few places where it did get a little bit boring,but that was because I couldn-'t wait until I would experience something new.The terrain in the game is nicely made,even though it is pretty old due to the date it was made.The places you travel through are pretty different,you won-'t be bored of seeing the same old place over and over again.The game itself is nicely balanced;except that they could have put less ammo in the game,so you wouldn-'t always have a gun loaded. 9/10Story: A nice story is told throughout the game,and that is guaranteed to keep you hooked until the last moment of the game.Even though it doesn-'t have any cutscenes,it tells its story just wonderfully.It keeps you in first person mode all of the time,so it makes you -live- the character all the way through the story.All the stuff that is happening in the game seems kind of logical,as if could happen in real life.The characters are well done as well,for they act as normal people would act.They are as they should be,they speak,fight,help you and do other stuff.And there is a wierdly acting character which stands out in the game;but I will let you figure that out for yourself.There aren-'t the same scientists all over and over again,but we can-'t say this with security guards.The enemies are widely assorted and won-'t make you think that they are dumb,but play as they are real and trying to get you.No dull moment will get you in this game,so don-'t be afraid of experiencing any in this game.  10/10Weapons: There is a wide assort of weapons to fit you in this game,but do not expect too much.There are the main weapons you would except from a game like this,and maybe a little bit more due to an -Monster Invasion- going on all around you.The game has its own signature weapon: A Crowbar.But that is also the only melee weapon that you can use in this game.While you progress through the game you will find weapons,but there aren-'t many,so every weapon you get,you make use of,because all of them are unique.As I won-'t spoil much here,I will just tell you that there are weapons from the pistol even to such weapons like a rocket launcher,and a few of alien techologies are found in the game as well.You will find yourself exploring all around you to get some ammo for your favourite weapon,because it gives you tons of ammo for a wide selection of weapons,and the ammo that you need may not be findable anywhere.When you shoot a gun it feels like you shoot a gun,meaning that you will find the gun bouncing back in your hand when you shoot it,and you can hear the sound for gun firing is well done as well.But when shooting a rocket launcher you will not bounce back,but if you move while shooting it the rocket will go wrong and hit another spot,depending on which way you moved.Even if you don-'t have any ammo,you get to use a alien techonlogy which has unlimited ammo.Even though it recharges over time,it doesn-'t take much of it and it has special abilities.  8.5/10Enemies: From the headcrab even to the final boss,the enemies are nicely balanced.You are slowly introduced to each enemy and its tactics,so you know what to use on it and what to do.You probably won-'t find yourself facing a unnormally big army of enemies if you aren-'t well armed.Once you learn the tactics the enemies use it is easy to defeat them,just keep a look out for them,or otherwise you might find yourself in quite a pickle.I wouldn-'t say that the enemies are hard.You can use the terrain to your advantage as well.Luckily,one group of your enemies is fighting another,so you can use that to your advantage as well,if you find the right moment.*wink*.But I wouldn-'t rely on such stuff,I would just get myself a nice arsenal of weapons and go defeat that crowd of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.There are a few weapons which have unlimited ammo,and I feel that is unbalanced.Don-'t go prancing around as a pony as well,you will get your ♥♥♥ kicked.There are flying enemies,crawling enemies,walking enemies and big enemies.The crawling ones are easy,just keep a look out for them so they don-'t get the jump on you.The Flying ones need the right weapons,like a zoom in crossbow,for they fly around and shoot at you and when you get close to them they just fly away.The walking ones are easy enough,just keep a shotgun on your hand and you will be OK.But the big ones need a plan,a strategy and a assault of weapons. 9.5/10Graphics: From Black Mesa labs to even Alien fields of doom,this game is amazing.It now has its own HD models,so a few things look better when the models are turned -ON-.Any computer will be able to get this game running,so why not jump in it already?And as this game was made in 1998,don-'t expect modern graphics.But that couldn-'t stop you from playing this game,could it?The terrain is kind of blocky and the characters as well,but if you look past that point get ready to indulge into a game that made gaming as it is today.And the graphics aren-'t that bad,everything is quite understandable.They have made the graphics the best way they could,and I don-'t blame them because I don-'t vote a game by its graphics.And if you can-'t stand the graphics there is a Source version of the game,made by Valve as well.There is a version made by fans as well,but I wouldn-'t recommend that because it is modified a bit.But the original is the best in my opinion as it is the completly unmodified version of half life,and the best out there.Of course,that is if you look past the graphics.There are even little details specified in the originl game,but they won-'t be seen so good and will be kind of blurred.But be sure to keep your eyes lit,for there are many levers,buttons and things like that throughout the game,that blend in with the enviroment. 8.5/10Overall look: Even though this game is dated,it is definently not dead.Be sure to pick this game up on a sale,or even buy it at its full price,because this game is worth every cent you pay for it.I loved the game,it really got me pulled in and the story was just stunning.I loved every place I came upon to in this game,seeking new adventure and traveling on into the deep unknown.This game is filled with interesting moments and is guaranteed to keep you aroused until the very ending.This is a great classic and everyone should play it,it is an experience not to be missed.It changed gaming as it is now,and was a hit in gaming and it still is.A wonderful game. FINAL SCORE ::::::::: 9/10.Reviewed by Ultrix.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
