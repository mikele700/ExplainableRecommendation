GOD, I JUST LOVE ITEM RUNNERS ONE OF THE MOST AGONISIING, ARTERY POPPING, RAGE INDUCING GAMES I HAVE EVER HAD THE HELLISH EXPERIENCE OF PLAYING. IF YOU DONT LIKE CAUSING HEART ATTACKS TO YOUR OPPONENTS BY GRAPPLING THEM FROM ACROSS THE MAP WELP THIS AIN'T THE GAME FOR YOU. AND THE FANBASE OHHH THE FANBASE IT CONSISTS OF, WAIT FOR IT......NOBODY. THERE ARE ABOUT 3 MABYE 4 PEOPLE PLAYING THIS AT ONE TIME AROUND THE WORLD. SO WHY DO I KEEP ON PLAYING IT? I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
