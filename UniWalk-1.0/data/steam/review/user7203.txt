Great game as is with so much more potential. Obviously dedicated support and developement team making improvements and fixes regularly. You will loose sleep over this game
Great game, worth owning. Has many good mods. The native game is very playable and has a strong community for multiplay battles. Realtime map, cities and strategy would be awesome with this style of gameplay
