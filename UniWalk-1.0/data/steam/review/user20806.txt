I like playing dota with my mates in the Philippines. I play in Australia and without WTFast I get 140-150 ping. Now with WTFast? Playing in Australia? No change. Playing with friends in the Philippines? 180 ping. Just what the ♥♥♥♥? And you guys want me to post a good review for your application when it obviously does nothing? I tried various settings to optimise the connection but to no obvious advantage of using the application. Uninstalled. And this isn't a troll WTFast developers! You guys have no respect for reviewers!
