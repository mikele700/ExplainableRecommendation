This game is simply amazing. The story is so well structered and takes you on an emotional trip from Pandora to Eden-5 and back. The amazing story along with their intos with a song and so many other things make it a memrable game. Listening to the songs takes me back to all the emotions I felt while playing. 10/10. only problem is the wait to season 2.
