This game is like, Meth had a baby and named it '3079 -- Block Action RPG', and they had to be on crack to call it that anyways.
Now, this is my sort of game.A game where simply, the game is made pretty much by the community in most aspects.There's no real way to grade it,It's made in a fairly outdated engine, but still graphics hold up fairly well, and the possibilities are infathomable, this world is literally yours for the taking, or even to make your own world.But does not mean it is without guidelines.If you strip back the game to it's minimum basics, it's dull, and boring, I imagine the only people who could enjoy playing Solo sandbox are 10 year olds who still watch stick figure fights on the internet.Since this game has no real moderated gameplay or multiplayer, besides from the VAC anti-cheat system, the game, and your experience with it depend on who you play with, and your interest in the game itself.I'm not giving it a rating, that's for you to decide how you feel about it.
