Being an apprentice mechanic I tend to be taking in alot of information all day while at work. I come home, sit down and fire up Car Mechanic Simulator 2015! This game is not only entertaining, challenging and fun. But is also educational! Being a youngster and not knowing much about v8's or carburettors this game extended my knowledge. Ripper of a Game! 10/10.
