**THIS IS AN AUSTRALIAN REVIEW. EVERYTHING MENTIONED IS ON AUSTRALIAN SERVERS**Dont buy it. It will just make you mad. The community in this is possibly worse then Ebola, and it gave me autism. Occasionally you will have a game where the outcome is not influenced by lag or unbalanced builds/characters but the majority of your games will be laggy cluster ♥♥♥♥s of overpowered spam.I have played 400+ hours and have become thouroughly addicted. For your mental and physical health and safety i dont recommend this game.*EDIT*Every patch they break it even more in the name of balance. There is no balance here..
*Edit as of   01/2015*If you havent got it already, and if you havent already dedicated a lot of time to this game it is EXTREMELY hard to establish a foothold in the game. You will be facing people with one shot, long range weapons that are just hours and hours of painfull chain dieing gameplay out of your reach.However:Great game. Strong mechanics and ultimately a smooth gameplay experience. Graphically demanding but it runs smoothly on most computers on low graphics at around 25-40 fps. No problems until it wouldnt verify my game and had to install but to be expected after the sudden influx of players they received. Thumbs up and please for gods sake add Australian servers..
