This is really the only mmorpg i would play, it is really worth the time I put into it :) Check it out even if you aren't a star trek fan its still one of the best mmos out there imo.
Great space, turn based stratagy game plenty of mods to make it more interesting aswell soo plenty of reasons to get this game if your are looking for a good way to pass the time.
This game is better then fire and sword in many ways
