I have enjoyed ark since it was first released but unfortunately there has been recent buzz about a new update which includes payed dlc for the early access game. A lot of people are giving hate to this dlc release as the argument goes 'its an early access game, why would you release dlc'. I know this is an extremely bold move and I agree with the argument other people are making, but I believe that this dlc actually looks promising based at looking at the trailer. So do I think the dlc is bad? No,Do I think that it was stupid to release the dlc in this stage of development? Yes
