I recommend this game to anybody that has a sweet tooth for first-person shooters, however, i also recommend to only play competitive. Why? People actually care about each other instead of kicking them as soon as they get into the game.Casual games are filled with nothing but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that just want to put you down for anything you have wrong with you:Bad Ping? = GoneYou like something that most people don't agree with?: GoneCan't clutch cus you aren't a pro?: GoneMeanwhile in Compet, People are only kicking each other only if they were trolling the entire team by throwing the game on purpose or assisting the enemies the sickest way they can.So please, buy the game, enjoy it while you can, play compet, but casual, I recommend avoiding that mode until you can pull off the meanest of tricks. Overall, fantastic game with no problems except the community putting you down for just trying your best, not the best impression on new players.
