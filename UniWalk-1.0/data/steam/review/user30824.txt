It is a very good game as I went into it thinking I was gonna be bad but if you get used to it you should have a good time. I also thought that I was gonna get smashed in the online, but it turns out that possibly everyone could win? I'm not sure but it was the case for me as I am not that great at these games. I hope this stays alive!
Really fun team-based game and I say it's the best one out there! If you want to play the game it's completly free!
