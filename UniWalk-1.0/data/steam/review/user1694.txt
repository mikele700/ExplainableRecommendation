This game, Is Amazing, The satisfaction of killing someone with your own creation is just.... So magnificent, I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.... This is one of those games where you will get on at 6pm then next time you look at the clock its 3am.... I have had a few of those already.I rarely review games. So that in it self is should say enough.9.75/10(few bugs eg clipping through floor if rammed hard enough by teammates)
