This is Simply Chess, and this is simply my review!-----------------------------------------------------------------The multiplayer is just great. You can 1 v 1 people just with one computer and battle randoms! The multiplayer does'nt have anyone on there, i know the community is'nt dead but why is this?-----------------------------------------------------------------You can change the chess peices and the look of the game over general. Alot of variation and is very good.-----------------------------------------------------------------Playing against bots is as great as playing against another human player!There are a selection of levels and you can pick which one to verus!----------------------SUMMARY-------------------------------So for people that dont wanna read here is the summary.8/10 Amazing Chess game with many ways to play but not much online matches.
So this is emily is away!Its quite meduim but i just have to say no.So i wondered if the dev made more chapters and maybe more scenarios before and after what happend here. There was not much good endings and i tried really hard to not be with emily and stay with emma but that didnt work. Valve please fix.

Completely bad. Its not fun when you have a good pc and the best way to run bo3 is ♥♥♥♥.The zombies was enaging and quite fun.Multiplayer felt like they thrown you into the game. --Campain was, fine but it didnt feel like the other cods.Overall i'll give it a 3/10. It didnt feel like the cods i played.

Single player (no friends) = ♥♥♥♥ this gameMultiplayer (Screaming 5 year olds) = Sell's it for cs:go keysThis game is just boring unless you have friends to party along with. Selling this game BTW just to loney :(
Hmmm, its hard but i got to say i dont. The 1.6 style is very amazing but zombies is not the type to mix with.
