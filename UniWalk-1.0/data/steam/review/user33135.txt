Interactive demoscene rubbish that controls and navigates like crap due to poor clipping and an absence of texturing. Fortunately, it comes with a collectible orb counter so that you have some sense of how close you are to finishing it. About half an hour long max (if you can stomach it). Further proof that the availability of Unity is killing gaming.
