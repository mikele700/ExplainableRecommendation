This game is amazing, if you have ever liked Animal Crossing or Harvest Moon, you will definetly enjoy this game.This game is some kind of portal through space, time and reality. It has simply switched my real life and game life to the point that my real life feels like a game and the game life is real life to me. Not sure whats going on but at least my crops are doing well. right? RIGHT!?all seriousness good fun game, almost through my first in-game year and looking forward to heeeaaapppss more
