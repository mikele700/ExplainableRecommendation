Probably the worst game I have ever played on Steam. Unlike Depression Quest where you at least get a few different endings, this game is a mixture of poorly drawn DeviantArt material with boring text. Unlike Depression Quest, no matter which option you choose, it's usually the same ending.
If you like Valve-related and you like something fun to pass the time for a few minutes, this game's for you.
