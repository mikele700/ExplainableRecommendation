It's Good. Nuff said
Very Fun 9/10
Pretty good for a free gameBlacklight: Retribution has very customizable characters and weapons with different barrels, sights, ammo and the list goes  on and on. Different camoes for characters, helmets for your agent (character), armour like boots, body armour, helmets and more.Good Elements of gameplayLots of game modes, balanced weapons, good sound effects and alot more make this game awesome. Nice sountrack too.
Such a fun life simulation STEAM ESSENTIAL! But the price is too high =) Still a fun game though!
This game is a great game especcialy for a first game from the new but awsome developer Green Heart Games. Such a great game for a first for GHG!
A great installment of the Hitman series brings 47 back to assasinate even more idiots and with more levels than i know exist XD my little brother plays alot! and the newly introduced contracts mode! the physics are better than Blood Money's but if you play on easy mode so if you want a challenge even on easy buy Blood Money instead (but Absolution is still fun XD!)
I just LOVE this game everyone should have it. It can be hard to get used to the controls but other wise it is fun! Especially the uber heart surgery with TF2's heavy and medic.
It's really fun to play I think you should get it although if you dont like survival sims dont buy it.
