This game has some of the finest multiplayer networking code ever to come out of any human mind. Proof:10:28 PM - Manifold Curiosity: should we try and play a game of 'waiting for other players'?
I chose to play the princess in this game and as Pwny points out she has rather ludicrous assets.  The game play isn't bad either. :P
Saints Row 2 is totally worth the $3.75 I paid during the Steam Xmas sale.If there is one thing I have learnt is that its awesome playing games 2 years after their release - Steam will flog it in a Xmas sale and the game will be just as great as it was at release.
