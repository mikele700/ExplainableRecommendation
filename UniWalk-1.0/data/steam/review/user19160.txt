Highly recommended for those interested in open-world and stealth games. You will be thrilled with so much actions before you know it. The game itself introduces a strong focal point in naval exploration for the first time in the series, which is something quite unusual. Another relatively similar game to this is the newer Assassin's Creed Rogue. Like all games in the series, the game incorporate both present modern-day events and a fictional history of real life events based on the 18th century Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, featuring three major cities of Havanna, Nassau and Kinston. The plot is long lasting and quite overwhelming as you progress further in the story.
By far one of the best MOBA game in the world with thousounds of players worldwide tuning in to watch the most popular esports major tournaments each year! DotA 2 is also apparently ranked 1st for the highest prize pool in esports scene. Free to play and definitely worth getting as it is loads fun, very addictive and requires much more skills than usual to master this challenging game. I have played both League of Legends and DotA, however overall I would recommend this game over League of Legends.Here is the rankings that is updated very regularly of all the largest prize pools in the history of esports scene with DotA 2 apparently ranked 1st: http://www.esportsearnings.com/tournamentsHope this review inspire all the players out there to play DotA 2!
