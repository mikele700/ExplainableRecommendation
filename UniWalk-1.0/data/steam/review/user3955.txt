Actually a lot of fun even with a Driving Force GT Wheel (which aint going to win you many races up front ;)).  Not about the winning for me - its about the fun factor and if you can get a lot from that from this game.  Server browser and creator needs work. The developers really need to think about having a server that can be left on and rotate through maps.  clicking ready and ♥♥♥♥ is a pita.. I understand that having someone join a race midway is a stupid idea, so that needs to be mitigated but the servers should be allowed to have timers for hosts to leave their servers on, have map rotations and also have the ability to manually change the current map without having to disconnect everyone.. also the host leave should revert another avaiable on the net machine to host the game in progress.   other than this the actual game play is a winner. everything is destructable (well 90%) and that equates to a lot of mayhem.  top job. can't wait for more development efforts as if this is what it starts off with I can't wait to see what you do next.
Don't. Buy. This. Game. Ever.
