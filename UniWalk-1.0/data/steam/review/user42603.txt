Long story short, this is the best game I've ever played. The universe and atmosphere are so interesting and lively, the story goes from cutesy highschool drama to really dark themes very quickly and finally, and most importantly, this game made me feel something. I genuinely cared for the wellbeing of the two main characters which is more than I can say for any game I've played previously and this only adds the the emotional devastation that comes from some scenes. The only one thing about the game I could say I dislike is the endings clearly limited by time constraint and budget but otherwise, the experience was one that I'll not soon forget. If you're thinking of buying this game, stop thinking. You're only wasting the time you could be spending playing it.9.9/10
I punched a guy several thousand times and was labled a psychopath before climactically leaping to the roof. Thus it is a fun game for the three hour maximum it takes to finish and quite good value for a few hundred megabites worth of funny, quirky videogame
I absolutely hate how terrible i am at this game. Play this with something to attack in anger close by.
