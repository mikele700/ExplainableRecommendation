This game is as if Double Fine Productions(The people who made PSYCHONAUTS,which is already a reason why you should buy this game)spent 3.3 million dollars on a game and spent a whole year on it......which they did.It follows the seamlessly combined story of Vella Tartine and Shay Volta,and thats all I can spoil for this game cause it's that good.If you want an adventure filled with comedy,puzzles,SPLARGH,an amazing atmosphere,a giant monster who eats girls dressed as cupcakes and a wolf that lives in the bowels of your ship that watches whatever you do..........Then Buy This Game.
