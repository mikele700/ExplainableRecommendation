I'm a huge fan of survival horror games and The Evil Within is up there with my favorite horror game. The story line and game play is nightmarish thanks to it's gorish atomospher and the more you play the harder it is to stop. It defitnaly sucks you in by the pervasive sense of dread that sets your mind racing at every crunch of glass beneath your feet and every distant groan from an unseen enemy and possible death around every corner.Not to meantion the boss battles they are suitably terrifying, twisted monsters capable of making you shiver at the mere sight of them.Definitely a worth buying game to add to any horror surviving/horror game collection. If you don't belive me pick up a copy for yourself, you wont be disappointed :)
If your a fan of the Resident Evil franchise like myself, then this game is right up your ally.
