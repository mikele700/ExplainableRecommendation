Okay, I-'ve read a lot of hate for this game, and would like to throw my voice in.First I-'m going to state my honest opinion.I like this game.I think it is a step in the right direction for the franchise.I don-'t think it-'s as good as Black Flag, but it improves on many aspects of it.Note that I-'ve played many AC games on my Xbox, but this is the first for my PC, therefore I can-'t comment on controls.First off: Pros - Fluid and interesting parkour -Interesting storyline, I recommend you read the official novel while playing, as it helps to flesh out the characters a lot. -Lots of side misssions -I think it-'s wonderful that the side missions all have historical links to real life -Story missions are a return to the franchise-'s roots: you get a feeling that you-'re building up to the big assassination at the end of the sequence. - Co-op is very fun, yet there are often problems with matchmaking (which Ubisoft are working to fix) - THE STEALTH SYSTEM. The stealth mechanics in this game are amazing, as this game has lacked a dedicated crouch button for ages. - Mission design. Assassination missions are MASSIVE with dozens of ways to get to your target, completely non-linearly. Cons - Buggier than Black Flag. I haven-'t had any major bugs, but others have. The worst I-'ve seen are co-op bugs due to                     connection, however I-'m used to that in my country. I have confidence that Ubisoft will work hard to fix bugs quickly and effectively. - -Stickyness- to walls and objects is often infuriating during chase missions but this has been around since the first game. - I can-'t remember how long the sequences were in the past games, but the ones in unity are generally 3 missions long. - I very much enjoyed the out-of-the-animus first-person missions in Black Flag, but they are not present in Unity (I think they-'re in Rogue, though) I do not like the replacement for these missions, being the -Server Bridge- where you are transported to a different time period of Paris (14th century, WW2, etc.) because although I liked seeing Paris in different ages the gameplay was a bit -arcadey-So there you go, my review for Assassin-'s Creed Unity. I enjoyed it a lot more than Brotherhood, Revelations and AC3Now, I assume my review is going to be downvoted to hell by haters, but at least I wrote it.9 out of 10
NOTE: In the next patch, scheduled for today (I think) the previously HIDEOUS Med. Portraits are getting a massive revamp, and will look far better, therefore I give this pack a good review.
Pretty good, it's free. Made by a 16 year old. Zombie spotting mechanics are a little derpy and its basically impossible to get zombies off your tail without a good weapon.
Pretty good old-school RPG with good graphics.Be warned that the puzzles take no prisoners (Pun intended) even on the lower difficulties
