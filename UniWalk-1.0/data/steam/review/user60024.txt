It's a pretty solid dungeon crawler, and it's well thought out to capture a large audience. Beginners in the genre, such as myself, will find an extensive tutorial and pick a easy level of difficulty, allowing them to get going without frustration, while seasoned players can skip the tutorial and choose a much harder level (there are 6 level of difficulty if I remember correctly).Of course you'll find most of the genre's commonplaces right there as you expect them - from the visual style to the types of objects, the gameplay mechanics, etc. This has caused some people to blame the lack of originality, but at the same time, had the game departed too much from these standards, people would have complained about it (or simply been turned away) as well. So I think the developer made the right choices.All in all, a solid recommendation if you're attracted to dungeon crawlers, whether or not you're skillful at them.
I like the arcade(ish) feel of this game, allowing even a noob like me to play it. I have some way to go before I can catch up with even the lowest pilot in the high-score table, but at least I can finish a race without difficulty, and enjoy it!The game works well on a low-end PC, provided that you choose a low resolution and the lowest graphics settings (which, while obviously not as good looking as higher settings, is not bad either).
That's a neat strategy game! It's easy to get into, and I like that there's a tutorial and a solo campaign before I get to go out there on my own, it will save me the unpleasantness of being owned like a noob while I am trying to figure things out.Great job, guys!
