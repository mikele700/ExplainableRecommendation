Great game 5 stars :)
An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community.The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot.But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that.
One of the best ''Boots on the ground'' call of duties out there.
This is a great game to play with friends.
Amazing game, The music fits this game really well.Made me tear up at some points in the game.
This game is great and all but.. where is the Jumpscares!?
Great game to play with friends.
Lets be honest, you bought this game so you could spell something on your Achievement Showcase.
Don't buy this game for $30.Wait for the price to go down and then buy it. But above all, This game is amazing especially the boss fights and the music.
This is So Awesome
