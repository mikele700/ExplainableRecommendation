Woof Woof Woof... WOOFThis game has it's awesome aesthetics, the jazzy atmosphere also completes the deal.Completed the normal story mode in about 3.5 hours (without hard mode)If you have played games such as these before, it's definitely worth a try. Weapons aren't too varied but that isn't a problem as you will tend to find a combo that suits you immensely.
