A good looking game, Handles well in my opinion, gorgeous scenery, Amazing graphics, Impressive sound, and a really challenging AI for those who love the sport.I personally would like to see some DLC featuring Classic Cars and Classic Tracks.
Very good game, I especially liked the -Zombies- mode. This gets a 8/10.
I remember when I first joined -Quake Live- it was not on Steam, It was in Beta but was just as good as all it-'s previous games. I definately would like to see either a Co-Op campaign added or an ability to create non pro servers for non pro members. In my opinion this game deserves a 9/10.
A very Interesting game to play, that's enough from me.
Despite the age of this game it still stands tall among other FPS titles.The atmosphere and gritty SFX still leave you guessing and on your toes.I reccomend this title for gamers young and old and of course the purists out there.I give this a solid 8/10.
A good game, though its missing the -Free Ride- feature from the previous game. I give it 5/10
A very challenging game indeed. My rating, 6/10
One of the funniest FPS games I have ever played. :D
