I have to be Honest, this is probaly one of the best games I have ever played. You can fly Planes, Steer Boats and Cars. This game is  really fun if you like Simulation games and racing games. This is also good because you can see and be some of your Favourite characters like Sonic, Knuckles, Shadow and many more. There is even a DLC for this game that involves the Yogscast! You get to be Simon with a awesome Jet, Car and Boat. I don't know why you shouldn't get this :D
