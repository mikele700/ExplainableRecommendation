Fallout 4 is exactly what I expected it to be, but more. Being able to customize almost every aspect of your character, it makes the game very unique, and giving itself replayability. Being able to customize your power armor, weapons, base & more makes it very exciting to play. The story in Fallout 4 is entertaining to follow and play. It incorporates many new things that no open world RPG has brought before. Combat situations feel like Battlefield, the scenary feels like Skyrim and the game itself is very flowy and original.But there are some negatives regardless that I will talk about. The game is buggy, resulting in loss of framerate, getting stuck, unable to continue at some points (needing to reload save) and other bugs that make the game irritating to play at times. But these are all things that Bethesda can definitely fix, as they are minor issues which already have fixes available online.A great game in total, great story & gameplay.A+
This game is a great idea made by bad developers. Spent hours getting my character looted only to be killed by someone with a wooden shank with god mode. Hopefully developers can fix this and I would buy it again.
Was a pleasure to work on this fantastic game!
