Michael Bay The video game.
Ok mass effect well its hard to say what I like about this game but what I can say about the intire expirence in a whole I love this game i am on my third play through right now and again this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. I persononally say this game is worth every penny but I suggest you wait until ME 1 and 2 are on sale becausae once you finish this one you will want to play the second and third. The reason I havent gone into detail is because you need to buy this game for yourself and play it. I am The Radish and this is my favorite game on steam.
great game recommend if you like gore and comics and point and click
Let me just change this review it was a bad review before now its a good one it turns out it was my computers fault but this game is great the graphics are meh the gunplay/gameplay is fun it kinda has a intresting plot if bother to follow it and playing the classic dooms is just great seriously just go ahead and buy this if you enjoyed Doom 1,2 and 3 and the dlc with it but probly wait until its on sale cause this doesent really improve much. I would give this a 7/10.
this is quite good
this game is alright
