Honestly this game has amazing potential, it is fun to play, you can just sit down, and drift, its fun, of course this game is ever improving and it will eventually (Hopefully) become a really popular game. The biggest issue i have is the fact that the controller support is bugged, you try and drive the throttle and brake are constantly being used even when you arent pressing the buttons--triggers, hopefully this is fixed very soon. all in all, a great game, keep it up guys.
