This is amazingIt-'s just plain funny which makes it amazing. But under that layer of jokes lies an amazing game with currently epic gameplay. I found 2 bugs so far and they aren-'t gamebreaking just a graphic error which can be fixed by changing the resolution down then up. The main screen is slow to repsond to your mouse which might put people off but ingame there is no delay and for a game which is amazing to play to waste an hour those bugs i would not worry about. And when i thought -what else could they add?- They gave me a torture chamber! I haven-'t even unlocked all rooms, cunning units and adorable beasts yet so theres alot of that. I do love the unit pictures that they have created, it feels like a banner but it works.Just a great game 9/10 Did i mention that they are adding in map editor?With Moar stuff?
