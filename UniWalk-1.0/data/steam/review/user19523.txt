Where can I start with this game. I came in having minimal expectations, and this game blew them out of the water. Coming in with a traditional -Need-for-speed- style racing experience, I had no idea what I was in for when I picked up the game. To be honest I bought it when it was on sale and the screenshots looked nice. I launched up the game and set the difficulty to intermediate -For racers with experience-. It was a step up from casual, where they basically drive for you. Next thing I know I am careening at 130 km/h into a Finnish forest. This game was hard. Infact I decided to sit down for an hour and practice getting the controls right, because off-road racing is hard. But by the time I finished my first event and came second overall, my agent said to me -Wow! A podium on your first event, I didn-'t expect that.- I realised that this game was meant to be a challenge, and I wasnt meant to go as well as I did. I think in my trials I killed my assistant driver several times due to taking a corner too fast, or turning for a fraction of a second too long and smashing sideways into a tree, door flying off, windscreen breaking exactly where you would expect it to. The physics of the car made the crashing far more realistic than any other game I-'ve ever played, and it made it feel so much more immersive.All up, the challenging yet fun racing, beautiful environments, and detailed car damage make this a must have for any racing fan.
