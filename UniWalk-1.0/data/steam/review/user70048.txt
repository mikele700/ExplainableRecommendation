Awesome and extremely satisfying FPS game. The game revolves around tactics, stealth and teamwork. 10/10
Good game, great gameplay both in the campaign and on Multiplayer. The game does have a slight element of horror in it, like when you're trying to explore an abandoned base and you don't know what's around the next corner. Awesome game.
