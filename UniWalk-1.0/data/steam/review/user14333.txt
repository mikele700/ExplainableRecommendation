Dota 2, arguably the steepest learning curve strategy game you will ever play, yet none more rewarding. A highly competitive game that is now played by millions (for millions, TI4 winners took ~5million USD), that is hugely satisfying.Pros:* Variety in hero builds and teams* High replay ability* Real-time mixture of RTS and MOBA elementsCons:* Brutal learning curve and impossible to master* Demanding community and poor tolerance thresholds* Huge, huge, huge, occupier of your time! (Some games last more than 60 minutes)Otherwise, what are you waiting for... At 805 hours total, I am beginner/intermediate level, and have no plans on stopping now...
