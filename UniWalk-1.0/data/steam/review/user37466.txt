Massive world to explore, Nice fighting scenes amd all the crazyness you would exp[ect from Mad Max. Suprised to see the cars are RH drive nice work guys keeping it to the movie :) Definatly a great game and i can see myself replaying the whole campaign once i have completed it.-n-nPros: Lots of things to do-nPunch on scenes and fighting tactics-npersonalaties of characters-nopen world feel-nweapons and enhancements-nlooks amazing-n-nCons:-nNone really only that there is no MP or Coop (Coop would be wonderfull to have factions etc)-nThe car revs wild everytime you get into it, considering Fuel is a valuable resource that does not make sence. not mention it is anoying after a while.-n-nMust have game in your collection.. And if they would allow modding tools so people can make there own coop mp that would be a bonus..
This is great fun, Pretty fair also :) Easy on system Specs and hasavery smooth frame rate. Makes me laugh when your running around with your bones showing :). It is amust have in your catologue and currently i am swithcing between Ghostsand This. Enjoy I am sure you will. It does look and feel a little like TF2 but this one has bettery hit ratings and makes it a but more fare for newer players against established players.
