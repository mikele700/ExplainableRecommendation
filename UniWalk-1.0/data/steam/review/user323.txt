On one hand it's definatley the type of free-to-play that tries to ♥♥♥♥♥ money off you, what with the repair system and going straight to the store page on pause, and it can rely on a controller.On the other, the combat is simple but fun, the equips/appearance/setting is suitably ridiculous and you play as a giant who gets to kill even huger giants. I like it.
