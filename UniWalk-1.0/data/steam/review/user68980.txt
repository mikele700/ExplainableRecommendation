THIS IS THE PERFECT GAME!There will always be people online and in my experience they're nice people with 2 being my friends.I love the maps, servers, gamemodes and the seemingly endless amount of achievements.The game has an amazing set of characters and actually has awesome lore behind it.There's multiple ways to win not only with different gamemodes but by knowing the map (finding good sniping positions). You must have a good strategy for this game [teamwork, switching between weapons (actually a very good strategy) etc.]. Or playing a class that you're just plain good at (e.g. I am the best with pyro amoung all the classes).I most definetly missed some but these are some of the reasons why Team Fortress 2 is a perfect game. 10/10*HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*Wait a second, Team Fortress has 12 letters and 9 classes 12 - 9 = 3 and 3 is the first number of 3201, if you rearrange those numbers you can make what looks like a Half-Life 3 logo.HALF-LIFE 3 CONFIRMED FOR THE YEAR 3201!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
