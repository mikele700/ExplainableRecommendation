I have not played enough of this ame to tell you if it's ♥♥♥♥ or not. What I am here to say is not to buy the steam version. After a single play session, where I bumped the video setting to 1080, I can no longer open up the game because it is telling me I don't have enough system memory on my video card. I have an R9 380 which can run the Witcher 3 at 50 fps on average at low - medium setting at 1080. Enough said.This is not just a problem I have expirienced as many others on the forums and others sites expirienced this as well with no fix by valve.Go support (censored by valve) because they actually put effort into making modern computers be able to run old games.Note: comment not censored by valve I'm taking the ♥♥♥♥.
