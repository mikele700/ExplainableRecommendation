If your a superhero fan, especially if your a Batman fan or even you just like games in general, Batman Arkham Knight is amazing!* It has superb graphics.* It's easter eggs are everywhere yet very clever.* Story is deep and complex.* Gameplay is responsive and fluid.If you dont want a chance to have an occasional frustrating experience on this game do not think of purchasing this until the bugs such as 30fps cap and some texture popping (etc.) are fixed for sure.Also, if you don't already know and are not buying it at all on PC because of the mixed reveiws on Steam, there is nothing wrong with the game itself! The reasoning for these negetive reveiws are for the bugs!The game as you probably know is being suspended from being soled on PC for a bit till Rocksteady fix it up, as the PC port was done by a third party company.You can change the fps lock by changing the ini files.If you do I recommend you back up your game first so it doesn't screw up.Over all this game is awesome and is most likely the best Arkham game in the franchise!
