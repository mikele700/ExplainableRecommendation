AMAZINGLY GOOD FOR A FREE TO PLAY GAME!!!
Amazing game for something thats only in alpha at the moment but does need to have a lot a bug fixes like Zombies going through doors, walls, gates and almost anything.
Loving this game after only playinh for 7 hours.It does have some moments in combat were you think -What the ♥♥♥♥ happened?- but other than that this game is what a RPG should be all about.
