An absolute masterpiece from the Gameplay, to the Music and design. AN ABSOLUTE MUST FOR ROGUE-LIKE/ACTION GAMERS!!
Undertale caught me completely off guard. As someone who enjoys a traditional RPG, and a story rich game with so much hidden lore, and a great soundtrack, I thought i'd give it a go. To be honest, I wasnt expecting much.This game, however, is EASILY one of the greatest games I have ever played, and it's truly deserving to be ranked high in the all time greats.The charm, the humour, the puzzles, the story, the finale (oh dear LORD the finale...I cant stop thinking about it), the philosophical nature of the game, the various pathways to take, the music, the fleshed out characters you genuinely care about...It's all somehow very beautifully tied together in this 4-6 hour game.You'll be replaying this game just like I did, and I imagine you'll see gaming, and the medium in general, in completely different ways.10/10 without a doubt in my mind.
