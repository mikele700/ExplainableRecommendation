Four months later and 3-4 teams of people still can't fix this PoSA strong indication that no matter how much you tweak and optimize a broken game, it still remains broke.Shame on Rocksteady/WB/IG/whoever is responsible for such a monumental f*ck up.Will never buy another RS game after this debacle.
