Tired of fighting players in PvP? Star  Conflict offers PvE, where a squad of 4 people are pitted against bots while they complete objectives.Smooth, clean, and engaging.Star Conflict has something for everyone to enjoy.
I highly recommend this game.From the simple mechanics and gameplay, to the highly addictive playstyle, Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is a very enjoyable game. There is no clear upperhand with any weapon, as each weapon is balanced perfectly. The classes all have balanced strong and weak points.This game is definatly worth your money.
A very fun Free to Play game, like D&D. People who spend money are still equals to the people who have not spent money. Very addicting and fun!
I was rather disapointed in this game.On the lowest settings, the game War of the Roses had a bad framerate. The controls are not very user friendly, and the game is hard to start off on.I do not recommend this game.
A classic turn based strategy game that tests your wits. From Barbarian raids to full scale wars, and from Warriors to Giant Death Robots, Civilization 5 will test you in every way imaginable. I highly recommend this game.
