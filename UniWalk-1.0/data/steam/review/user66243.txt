It is good because it is compatable with mac and it is cod. But i still dont understand why they couldnt of just made black ops compatable with mac and not have to make a whole other game!
Things i put into CS:GO -- Money- Time- Effort - SkillCounter Strike, if your not a cod player is for most people the all round best game franchise. You cant really complain with CS:GO's amazing graphics, SKINS, teams, ranks and high skill cap. Until skins game out on CS:GO, or i atleast found out about Em' i was never interested in the competitive aspect of it and just played for fun. Soon after I started finding out about Blue gem case hardeneds, slaughter patterns or the later found dopplers and this intrigued me. I started my CS:GO life of as a Silver II as my first rank. As i started working my way up the ranks, fighting to get past red handed hackers and blue handed smurfs i found many friend that are on a daily basis influential to me. Whether it be a school friend, someone who lives close to me or someone that lives half the world away from me i kept finding myself in banterific relationships with all sorts or people from everywhereBest game if ever played ,                                 LuX
First of all its got quite good graphics but not the best. It is better than the previous borderlands but not by much. its a good game:-)
Its not the best zombie game but its pretty good. I also admitt that the graphics arent the best but all together its a pretty good game.
Its AMAZINGGGG!
It is one of my all time favourite games. i find it very fun playing with your friends or on your own. P.S you should get it.
