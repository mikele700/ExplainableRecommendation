I played this game for 53.4 hrs on record. Was fun while it lasted. Pick it up if you got nothing to do.
From start to finish this game was nothing short of amazing. A morality system taken to a new scale, and one of the best OSTs I've heard in a long while, on top of an amazing story and character cast. 10/10
South America is Satan and Russians can only play pudge are just a few of the many lessons Dota 2 has taught the world today.
