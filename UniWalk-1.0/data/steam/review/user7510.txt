this game is awesome! no doubt about it. i like it for these reasons.-they fixed ALOT of the problems in vanilla isaac/wrath of the lamb such as Spoonbender being a piece of crap.. which it is now useable and overpowered as fk if used with the right items/powerups.-they upgraded the graphics of the game while somehow making the game run smoother on older machines. -the music is deff a step up from the original game.-BIGGER ROOMS!-more enemies!overall, a worthy remake of the original game and well worth the money to get it.
