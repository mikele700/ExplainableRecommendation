So far this game looks like it will be really good when it is complete or atleast with a few more levels and features added to it, and it-'s less of a game and more of a eye opening first person movie, which reacts to ur inputs, which is probably the easiest way to say it.So far there are three charecters, which are more like three points through your life. Young child Grown (working) Adult ElderlyThe levels are very short at this point of the games early access stage, though the child level was a bit rage endusing, and took a little bit longer to complete, it is still very short. the biggest factor of this game, is the concept, and -view-by this I mean what the game seems like it is trying to convey, and what it seems to be about. The three charecters show how the three big stages of life, and how our perspective of life changes throughtime, the child turns everything into a challenge, and everything dull, into somthing bright and fun, then the adult, nothing is very fun, all the bright things in life are now gone, forgotten or ruined, and your only goal is to get to work and earn your paycheck, and then the last, retirment, the elderly, where every thing is a forced challenge, and is grey and empty, and your vision is hazy, the game does a great job showingthis, and is jut going to bet biger, longer and better, this is a game that you should deffinently keep your eye on, and you should also download it now and ive it a shot.
