If you-'re looking for a somewhat intense old school strategy game then you might like X-COM Apocalypse. In this game you control units and craft to destroy impending aliens, and as you go along you will get, better weapons/more ammo, access to disruptor and toxin technology, more agents and more money. However, the aliens get more advanced week after week, and you will commonly find disruptor guns at week 2, harder and harsher UFO-'s almost every week, new units and will sometimes attack buildings. In the -Overworld- you fight alien craft and have access to the different menus (Other than the main in-game menu). In the Tactical (ground combat) world you first have a debriefing (Tends to be the same) and the choice between Real-Time and Turn-Based combat. You control X-Com Agents in the field and go hunting for the aliens, but be careful! If you put too many in one place to hunt you might find yourself in a LOT of trouble. Hence were waiting come in handy. You want to pick off as many aliens as possible (UFO Crash landings bring out the most of this) before sending your units into the darkness to find the aliens There are different ranks for each agent, from rookie to commander and to get said ranks you must fight in Tactical. The game has its fair share of bugs.Summary: a very strategic and fun game. 9.6/10
