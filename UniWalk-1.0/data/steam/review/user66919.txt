A great fun game that can be mastered easily. If you put the time and the effort to get somewhere in it you'll understand how to play the game. Though I have no got there yet. I still love it, for me it can be trickie at times and I find myself circling around abit. Just a great game, GREAT. JUST GREAT!
A great strategic game that involves many different elements. How can I say it`s BLOODY AWESOME, it`s just I never got a feel for it ;-0
