Garry's Mod is an amazingly awesome game. you must I repeat YOU MUST GET THIS GAME !!! IF YOU DONT YOU WILL REGRET IT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. There are the ocasssion bugs and sometimes internet lag because of downloading mods and addons as well as textures but its all worth it. If I were to rate this out of 10 it would be 9.5
Massive rip off of unturned which is super ♥♥♥♥. Not even worth being payed to play.
