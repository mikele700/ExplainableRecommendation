For those who want to be a sniper.. here's your simulator.
D.O.T.A 2 most easy to be addicted with.... hehe. its not easy to learn but if you practice practice P.R.A.C.T.I.C.E. hard enough maybe you get your goal :D
Played it just a little moment since it lags in my pc :C i hate the maps. . they are H.U.G.E also its hard to control the vehicles :S But. . i think its the most played game ever. :3
This....is game absolutely R.O.C.K.S...I have no word for it.
Played it for awhile too like planet side 2 but i dont understand such a thing O.O the Vehicle control really hard to learn.. and its fun never tried playing like police or something
This game is absolutely A.M.A.Z.I.N.G it has everything =D got it on holiday where its F.R.E.E :D Im getting addicted <3 <3 <3
One of the most played game and my first online game =D. Thanks to Valve for making such a wonderful game. Sadly im still F2P player XD
