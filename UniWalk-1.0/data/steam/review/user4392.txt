This game is pretty good.
It's okay.
I played this on the ps3 and hated it, also, it took me way longer then it should've for me to get to sanctuary. I picked it up for free weekend cos why not? OMG this game is ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant I'm only lvl 11 and have a explosive blue weapon which can take out a players shield in one shot! With a LOAD more guns than the first games, this game is worth picking up if you like shooters!
It's just cause 2. On crack
It's like Valve had a baby with Gordon Freeman and this is minature Freeman still as good as his father(s).
One of, if not THE BEST zombie game so far! Valve has upgraded this from the first game by so much! They added new modes, new special infected AND the steam workshop, could you ask for more in a zombie killing game? NO! Also, it's fun to play on or offline, so when you have no internet you can play with bots. It throws in 7 new maps and the old 7, also, you can get custom maps by other players for the workshop! If you have the spare change (I'm sure you do, cause, it's only $10) than pick up this game, it's worth your ♥♥♥♥ing money!
Good guy overkill fixing their game since update 100
