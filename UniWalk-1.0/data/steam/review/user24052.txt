Rainbow Six is a very good franchise overall with some stand out games, and Siege delivers the classic Tom Clancy experience with intence gameplay and machanics, but most of the operators are very useless and i only use about five and the loading times for matches is painful sometimes. I would still reccomend this game to people wanting a new FPS to try out and thought it was worth the money.
