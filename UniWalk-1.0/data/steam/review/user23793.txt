Haven't played but looks like Skyrim w/ guns and tanks.10/10 would bang repetitively with everyone watching.-IGNAlso needs more Chanty
Apparently I couldn't carry a sniper as it was too heavy for me... I was then held up by a squeaker who was eaten by zombies which i tried to turn around and shoot but game bugged out once again and magazines left my invent as attempting to hold a sniper wipes your invent.Dayz is double the price but 50x better than this piece of ♥♥♥♥ and Dayz itself is only in pre alpha... Do yourself a favour and keep the money in your pocket and spend it on worthy games.So i say proudly, if you own this game uninstall it, if you want to buy this game or are even remotley considering it, look up dayz/rust right now.
Run n gun. lol
