*** New Update ***So after four months the game finally got an update, all it took was the game being pulled from sale on steam, seems very suspicious as the community was in uproar for months with no word from the dev Jig then within two weeks of the game getting pulled from sale we suddenly get an update.As for the content, one new dinosaur which was already in the game files and unlocked by modders months ago, stampedes which consist of 30 dinosaurs running around eachother in circles instead of the normal one or two, a trap mechanic which is poorly implemented and a couple of value changes. I doubt the dev spent more than a couple hours on it.Id hold out on any purchase of this game untill we get a steady steam of updates and a promise from the dev that they arnt going to just dissapear as soon as the money starts coming back in. The game has potential but I honestly don't know if the dev has the ability to finish it.***UPDATE***It's now been over two months, there have been 0 updates in that time, no ones heard anything from the devs and it turns out that the pr manager Governor Ostrich was a freelancer who's contract expired may 31st. No updates, no word from devs. Stay clear
Huge open world, loads of stuff to build considering its only been out a few days, decent graphics, much less lag than before they patched it. Ignore the negative reviews by people that don't understand what an early access is. These are honestly some of the nicest devs i've seen and they will work their asses off to make sure this game gets better and better, have a look in the community forum and ask em a question if you want, the fact that they'll answer it is an absolute breath of fresh air compared to some devs and your response will come way quicker than you'd expect.
