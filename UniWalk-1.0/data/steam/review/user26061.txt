Clandestine gives an amazing new outlook to stealth games, by not only setting up the view of the person in the field but also the view of the person who is behind the scenes making sure the field operative (field op) is in the safes of hands when it comes to navigating enemy locations filled with armed guards. Clandestine is fun to play singleplayer, having to switch between field op and hacker, however it is even more fun, yet easier, playing Clandestine in co-op mode. The co-op mode is where one person plays as the field op and the other as the hacker, working together, and making it much easier to play. Co-op really lets players get into the experience of being the hacker helping the field op or being the field op and using different tactics to take out or sneak past enemy guards. In all Clandestine is a great game for stealthfully navigating enemy locations as a sneaky field op with a hacker at the ready.
