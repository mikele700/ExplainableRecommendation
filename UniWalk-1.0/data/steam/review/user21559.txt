South Park The Stick of Truth is one of the best turn based RPGs I have played in several years. The game has well over 20 hours of content and the whole experience is like one of the best written episodes of the show. The feeling of playing an episode of South Park is present in every scene and every batlle. The fact that the user reviews are mixed is really dissapointing because this game is accessible and great to play. I did play the game with an Xbox 360 controleer so I don't know how the controls map to PC but overall I feel that the game is totally worht full price and that the player will have a great time no matter what choices they make in the game.
