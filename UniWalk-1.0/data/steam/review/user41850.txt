This is the best survival game I have ever played; not that that's saying much, as I haven't played many, with most of them being zombie-based. I don't think I've ever seen a game quite like this, in that it's just you in a wilderness with only your wits and some luck to keep you alive. Especially considering it's an alpha game with 6 zones and only sandbox, this game looks beautiful, sounds beautiful and can be both hauntingly beautiful and completely terrifying. The difficulty settings are pretty fair; the easiest difficulty makes it easier to appreciate the cold beauty and deadly serenity  of the game, the middle is harsh but fair (sometimes), and I haven't even looked at the most difficult.All in all, best $20 I have ever spent.
