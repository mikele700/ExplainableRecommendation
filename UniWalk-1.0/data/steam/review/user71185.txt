A great addition to the Counter-Strike series. Filled with many servers, players; old and new and the competitiveness of the people is just overwhelming. The game welcomes any player; beginner or veteran.I'd recommend it to anyone who likes strategic plays, positioning and a game takes incredible aiming and reaction speeds to beat your opponents.
Fallout, a one of many people's favourite game in the classic Fallout series. Fallout: New Vegas is just a piece of something much greater. Recommend this to anyone who likes a post apocalyptic game setting mixed with the times of the 1950's.
I recommend this highly to anyone who loves a game that makes you cautious of any player that gets near you and loves a  post apocalyptic game with the objective being who can survive the longest.
APB Reloaded which stands for All Points Bulletin Reloaded is a game about two factions fighting against each other in the city of San Paro. One faction are the Enforcers while the other is the Criminals. Enter either of the two combat districts; Financial or Waterfront and fight against your enemy faction in order to earn unlocks for items, cash and rank up. Enter the fight club districts to earn Joker tickets, practice your aim and enhance your game sense.Enter the social district and chat with other players even if they're your enemies or customize your clothing, vehicles or weapons.I don't know about other players but seems like a great game to me. The competitiveness in combat districts is challenging and the unlimited amount of customizing that you can do in the game is awesome as well. Vehicles, clothing, symbols, even the music that you play while you're in the vehicle, you can customize.I still wish there was a Australian server since a majority of Australian like playing this but overall, it's a great game for anyone who likes free roam third person shooters where you can customize anything.
Arguably still one of Rockstar's best creation to date and one of the best GTA's alive.
