Fallout: New Vegas is very interactive. Anything you do in the game effects your karma and how towns will respond to you. I recomend this to those who loved Fallout 3 or any of the Elder Scrolls series also made by the same company, Bethesda Softworks. Guns, Cannibalism, Theivery. Whats not to like?
