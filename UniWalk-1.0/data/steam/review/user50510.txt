Like Farcry 3 without guns. 11/10
Eh, I'll be blunt. This game is buggy as ♥♥♥♥ at best, and, that being said, can be pretty fun to learn and, hopefully master.   Because, this is a game that you have to know inside and out if you want any hope of not being tied up against an empty bathroomwall, forced to eat rotten kiwi fruit and then promptly beaten to death with snow shovels.

Unless you love being paranoid out of your ♥♥♥♥ing mind, this game isn't for you
