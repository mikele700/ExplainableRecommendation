I still believe that this is a great game, lots of great memories and still great fun. Everyone is giving this great, fantastic a -not recommend- because they took out 18 songs and it really makes me sad, just because they took out some songs, everyone is saying stuff like, -rip rockstar- and -i hate this game because of the new update.- If you-'re a TRUE fan of the game, this little change shouldn-'t bother you at all. I still love this game, and it-'s still up there as one of my favourites. In conclusion; yes. Yes you should DEFINITELY pick up this classic game.
