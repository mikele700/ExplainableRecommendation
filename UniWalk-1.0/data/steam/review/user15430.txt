#MakeBlacklightRetributionGreatAgain
A game where Ciri, Master cheif, The predator and Ezio Auditore fights teletubies
Overall, the gameplay is good, Ranking system is good and customization is good as well. But I do not recommend you to play this game if you have a slow computer or a bad GPU, you will have a bad time. Please make an option to disable shadows and lower resolution. because every slow players are suffering in this game.
