Yeah, it's neato I guess. Bought oberon feyarch and a lot of people hate me now, but uh, yeah pretty solid game.
Nearly cried because I didn't know how the game worked at first and tarr killed all of my slimes 10/10Real talk though, this game is amazing. It brought me happiness during a little bit of a hard time, which is amazing cause I sometimes stay in funks like those for a long time. They took an odd concept and executed it wonderfully for such an early game. There's a lot to do and different risks such as not having enough food, slimes escaping at the early net stage and those evil tarr slimes. There is also great reward, smiling slimes, a feeling of completing objectives you've set for yourself and just all in all happy times. Can't wait to see what else they add to the game. New slimes? New areas? New fruit? Maybe even different species of tarr. Buy this if you want a fun indie game to screw around with and can keep coming back to. 10/10 for reals
