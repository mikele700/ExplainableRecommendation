Ok so, the game is actually great but the review I'm writing is specifcally about the new update which to be quite honest was absolutely ♥♥♥♥. Valve brought in a new gun, the Revolver. This weapon on first glance is pretty cool although it might need a few tweeks. The area in which is ♥♥♥♥ about this game is the new way the game is displayed. A lot of my friends think that maybe the graphics are worse now as well. Also the crosshair is different and I'm speaking for myself and a lot of my friends when I say that it is so so so bad. Honestly the new crosshair is terible. If there was one thing Valve could take from this review it would be please oh please change the crosshair back. The old one really was much better in every way. Thanks for reading if anyone actually is.
