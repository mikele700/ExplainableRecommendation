One of the best games i've played in a long time! Heaps of content to keep you busy, incredible gameplay mechanics and of course amazingly fun! Buy this ASAP! You won't regret it!
Dark souls the rogue like, and its not fun
This game claims to be a lot more than it actaully is, Their is no offline training training, online is very laggy and it is only fun for about 30 minutes, the only reason I have more game time than that is that im forced 2 play it with my little brother. Another thing is that their are tons of maps but no difference in how they play
Want to play a perfect shooter? Then buy this game ASAP
