finally they patched the game and most bugs/glitch's are gone.multiplayer works but atm i have to say its pre dumb cant build a bridge to fight one another making knights and archers usless in a PVP.but over all the game is moving along very well and it is fun to make stuff and defend of waves in survival.the game is $20 atm it is fun but for the money u spend to where they are in the making of the game it is to much should be like $10 tops
Sacrifice was by far one of the best game of its time and i loved it to bits played over 1000 hours of this game form steam play to my disk copy that i still have.the game itself was kinda a combo of RTS, RPG, and FPS but also had a very good story and player picks the god they fight for with the option to change to another almost all the way into the story all i have to say is this is a must have and play
If you like FPS or TD games or hate how you do nothing in TD games but watch then this is your game build and hold your TD base from waves play 4 classes get towers wants not to like
i love this game
