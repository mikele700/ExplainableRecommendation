Reviewing is certainly difficult, I got the game after episode 4, binged the first 4 episodes and then waited diligently for the conclusion, I could go on for a very long time about the positives and negatives, and I really do wish there was an option to review each episode individually, because while the first 4 episodes really are exceedingly praiseworthy each in their own way, I can't in good conscience call the whole thing a masterpiece, because it stumbles so painfully at the last hurdle, the final episode is rather bloated and painful to play, most especially because in the end, it barely addresses many of the important things that earlier episodes foreshadowed, leaving significant chunks of the story feel completely gone from the end narrative, I would still say you should play it, because 4/5 being very good is enough, just, don't expect wonders from the ending
A 2D puzzle platformer, featuring a small child going through a really messed up experience in a mysterious setting, wouldn't be from the same people that made Limbo, would it?In all honesty, this game is an incredible platformer, brief, confusing, deep and very enjoyable, the puzzles strike a blend of challenging, without being so difficult as to hamper the incredible game itself, I really would say Playdead have bested themselves, proving that they can surpass their breakout hit Limbo, providing one of the best indie titles out there, absolutely worth the price, even if it isn't the longest game out there, unquestionably a masterpiece.
eh, it's ok I guess, the community is kind of dumb though
