Great Game with Intense levels, i did back it and play the demo a year ago and i am disappointed with the progress with only 1 new level and the graphics have not been improved noticeably. I do think this is a game suited for early access as the more people buy it the more time the developers can dedicate to improving existing levels and creating new ones. There is only room for improvement.Great game sober, Insanely fun game smashed.
