War Thunder is a WWII Online Multiplayer that aims to deliver a fun experience on all three types of vehicular combat, namely: air, land and sea (tanks are partially implemented, and naval combat is in future development.) This game is free (although pay currency and premium accounts and vehicles are present), and does indeed look spectacular as a F2P, and generally delivers a fun experience in its existing state. However, as with most MMO's and F2P games, there is a grind for higher tier vehicles and upgrades, so this may turn away some players.Unfortunately, there are some inherent problems that currently exist that can marr the enjoyment for players and/or those who are particularly focused on the realistic and factual aspects of this game.Various problems include inconsistencies with damage dealt or taken, factual errors of stats/vehicle specifications, matchmaking issues (various tiers/battle rating of vehicles intermixing to large degrees), and vehicle performances. Some of this can be attributed to the fact it is a player driven game, and thus cannot be 100% historically accurate unless specific constraints are implemented through player organised events or game mechanics.Some of these problems were present fairly early and still exist, (The developers seem to have its attention focused in pushing new content which has pros and cons) though patches may generally solve some of the issues, you can expect unfair tiering at times.However, I generally look past most of the whole 'pay to win' parts or grinding and simply squad with friends or strangers to focus on playing the game and having fun. the game delivers on that regard and is relatively easy to slip into and start playing, thus I would recommend this game.
Hurr durr Terraria. No really its a good game!
