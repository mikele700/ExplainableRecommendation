A classic from square enix, and while not close to being my favorite Final Fantasy game, it is still a great game which any fan of RPG's should play. however, as some people complain about currently the music of the game is in a low quility Midi file (the same as the original PC version) however when i started playing it i didn't really notice that the music was BAD, its just not as good as the PS1 version. there is currently a mod that can put the original PS1 music (or orchestral version) in. so if you don't mind modding then i recommend that you get the game now, if you don't want to mess with your files and mod, i recommend waiting for the fix, or buying it now and then waiting for the fix before playing it.
