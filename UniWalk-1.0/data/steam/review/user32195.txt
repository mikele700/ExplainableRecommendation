I had so much fun with this game it is insane to think I would enjoy a game like this BUT I DID! The combat is so indepth there is so much to learn and so many combos to use. The port was amazing compared to the third which is barely playable without the use of xpadder. The game ran really smooth and the graphics are still amazing for such an old game. The different skills you could learn was also great, I also like the fact you could refund and buy another skill so you could test out different types instead of upgrading something and not being able to change it later.I had so many laughs with the main protagonists (nero and dante) I couldn't even hold myself with laughing at some points not to mention they are both completely badass! I enjoyed all the boss battles they were unique and fun to verse. The story was fairly well done also and It really made me want to play more just to find out what was going to happen. Score:  9/10 was great and definitely worth the money and time I put into it.
