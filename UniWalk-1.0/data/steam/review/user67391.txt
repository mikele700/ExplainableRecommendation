This game has been a fabalisous experience
I think alot of things about alot of stuff like how do people think Miley Cyrus is hot she has no booty i mean its just skin and bone she is probably going to break something one of these days but back on the topic skyrim wow what kind of a name is skyrim its like pacific rim and sky i mean its weird and that asain girl in pacific rim is pretty badass but i think that she should have showed the blade sooner and when did she have time to install it anyway its a good game (skyrim) but it is so weird because their is a lust to get mods its like once you get one you can't stop its like chocolate mmmmmmmm... chocolate i love chocolate its awesome and i dont get how someting that taste so good is bad for you like no one has ever died from eating chocolate thats just a urban legand like how the migit from jackass died the migit in jackass doesn't do anything he is a ♥♥♥♥♥ i like migits especieally in movies but not game of throne that is a f***ed up show but got to give it pointers on the boobies oh god im off track. it there a movie called off track  ok when im older ima make a movie called off track its will be FABULAS but enought about me skyrim is cool il give it a 7 1/2 out of 8 thanks for reading you fat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
