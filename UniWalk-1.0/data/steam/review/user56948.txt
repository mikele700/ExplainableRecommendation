Love it, great conclusion(?) to the bioshock series, the time travel was a bit confusing but the graphics and gameplay of this are top notch!
Really amazing game!!!Few technical issues but there are many fixes availableThe graphics and story are nice and the fighting system feels really smooth to useAlso lightning is 9/10 waifu
Much Better than Batman Arkham Asylum! Good Game!
Good game if ur usally in a rush and if you only have a few minutes!
Fun game, i dont really like the other characters, so i just stick with the main guy, nice and fun, very cool to build a base and survive off renewable stuff
Most laid back, relaxing game ive ever played, just wait till you get to the end! its a doozy!
You wanna hack? this is the best game their is!Annoying when you lose all your progress and it does get a bit boring a few hours in, but still very good.Oldie but a goodie
Nice, Calm and Relaxing game, towards the end it got fairly confusing and difficult but it was nice to play
Amazing game, beautiful graphics and story, very well designed, playing it just feels so right!!
