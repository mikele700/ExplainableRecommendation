Really Really a Nice Game,on of the best shooter games out there
well there is a bad side and a good side but I honestly think that the bad side is too much I think the the Multiplayer is kinda bad and Maybe I dont play it well but you will die too quick so its not gonna be easy and many other issue that you will find in this game but the good side is the story mode is a pretty well done job  and the Aliens mode is pretty fun but If you are like me that finds game fun only in Shooting Other People in games I would think that this game is not that great of a multiplayer though its only my Opinion some of you might not agree with me because each people have a different opinion so yeah if your looking for a New Mode in Call Of Duty well you should try this but like i said if your more of a Multiplayer Shooting Players VS Players guy than I would highly recommend not to waste your 60$. Peace
