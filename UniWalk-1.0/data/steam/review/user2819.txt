senpai noticed me
you get to be Ghandi with the great wall of China and Angkor Wat with enough troops to invade/ take over the world. Realism at it's finest 11/10
it's like minecraft but not at all
WTF this game is ♥♥♥♥ #CallOfDutyForLyfe
its like LoL, but five times harder and five times russian.
you do not play the game. game plays you.
instead of getting an orbit around kerbini got an orbit around the sun itself.10/10
EPILEPSY WARNING! this is one of, if not THE best game in my steam library. you play as a square, triangle, and a sircle and you have to listen to the music to progress. well, it helps. yes, i know its a short game, AND you can finish it in less than an hour, but its still a grate game. the boss fights are like hell, but grey and black and all over the place. its only, like, 38 MB so if you can't handle anymore Russian’s yelling at you in dota 2, this game is for (you unintentional rhyme)
like the crazy brother of TF2 but on crack cocane. 9/10 pandas.
you can go pew pew and jump and your at another place and a white thing whith a lazer beam goes pew pew and you goes pew pew and it fall and its freind goes pew pew and you die. 10/10
