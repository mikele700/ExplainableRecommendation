I would highly recommend this game because it is alot of fun and is a great game.There is ALOT of epic weapons and different playing styles. There is the ability to buy (through the currency earned in the game) blueprints for new weapons and make them yourself. To do this you need to earn the resources through game play and by visiting different planets. You can play the game in solo mode which allows for a more leisurely game or you can play by inviting other players (through private mode) or play online with other players joining when they want to.I personally like to play online because this enables you to collaborate with other online players on missions. You can also set up a clan or you can ask to join an already established clan. Clans give you more support and great team work. You can buy (with game currency) special blueprints (not available through the store) from the clan research facilities through the clan dojo.
