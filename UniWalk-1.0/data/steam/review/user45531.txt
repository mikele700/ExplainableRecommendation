This game is simply amazing. This sandbox game has attempted to go over an obstacle that most sandbox games suffer from, the feeling that you have nothing left to do. And let me just say, the developers have done this beautifully, instead leaving you thinking of what to do next. The best thing about this game is that the developers are willing to listen to suggestions from the community, something as a game developer you need to take advantage of.  If you enjoy games like Minecraft and Terraria, you NEED to check out this game.
This game is one of the best free to play games on steam so get it NOAW!!!
