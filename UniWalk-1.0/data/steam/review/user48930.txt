Fun game, but like most free games there is alot of waiting for things, to get new gear and 'warframes' you have to wait between 12hours to 3 days. For a free game id definetly recommend it, if you like your games to contain alot of flexability in the way you play then you will love this. Get past the begining stages of the game and you will see why i have clocked so many hours into it.
Borderlands 2 is awesome and well worth geting. for single player or multiplayer, the experience is one that i wont be forgeting any time soon!
