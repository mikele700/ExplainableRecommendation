this game is soo funn when i bought payday the hiest i thought oh really good game very well made then i got payday 2 and wow the best game ever
ok i dont no why all the bad reviews this is an awesome game i love the jumping part of it with your exo suit that is fun multiplayer is as fun as can get i like the way you get supply drops and get customizable parts in those drops or weapons its always fun to see the awesome things you get in those supply drops i like the new weapons there alot of fun i love the fact you can show off your awesome avatar person and i like the way you can gget all the awesome looking body armours and helmets the campaing is fun honestly thats the only down in the game i wish the campaing went longer its easy to finish even on higher difficulty settings if your a hardcore pc gamer other then that the game is awesome one of the best cods by far first is black ops 2 then goes this one i highly recommend this game and i love the fact of exo zombies that will be ablot of fun
the game looks well made it is alot of fun but when i go to play it there rarely seems to be people online other then that the game is great really fun i like how it is set back in ww1 thats alot of fun enjoy the game
