Great Game,Cons:When trying to play online player you have to create a server which is frustrating. The game can get really laggy when there are loads of enemies.Recently I got an error whenever i try to open the game stopping me, still haven't fixed thatApart from that though, the game is well worth its price and is a great timewaster!
