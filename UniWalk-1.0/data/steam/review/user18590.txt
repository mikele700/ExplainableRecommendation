great game with great multiplayer. i normally get 300ping ongames but when i play this i get 60-70. easy to play, hardly any hackers (havent found one yet) maps are set out well. not as much nade spam as described by other people, definetly a run and gun game tho. only one con and thats those quick scoping fgts but that anit the games fault.
The base game is great. 10/10
