I haven't left my house for three consecutive days now
I've always enjoyed the whole idea of stripping randoms, but now i can do it in game too.
Princess Evangile is really a masterpiece. The plot is fantastic, and engaging as well as being really enjoyable to read. Combined with the artwork and the characters, it really accentuates how well made this -game- is. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this, as it can really bring out your emotions. Absolutely fantastic, and would recommend it to people into anime, love, strong plot, and visual novels!

If My Heart Had Wings is a an absolutely fantastic visual novel and by far my favorite. I have already clocked in over 30 hours in order to complete all routes within the novel, and I haven't regretted a single one. The novel can truly bring out all your emotions, and has constantly been engaging and exciting. The novel is really well made and the art and illustrations are fantastic, a simple masterpiece. Despite some spelling errors and English grammar mistakes. It really is a VS i would suggest to all those who enjoy anime, VS's, choices and simple reading. All the best in your play through!
