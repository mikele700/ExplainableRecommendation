Borderlands 2 is a game for people who likes looting and get special weapens or gain xp.Its a FPS and game and weapens won't be the same although the gun its same design or name but the damage and others aren't the same.You can choose the class you like but i think Siren and Gunzerker's Action Skills are more helpful, others also good.Best Co-op game i ever played,you guys gonna try it.Its realy that FUN :D
For those who thinks that this game is fun,well it's looks fun but not really.You will need to sign up for a acc to play it and it doesn't have a server for this game.This is A piece of ♥♥♥♥!Don't waste your money on this game, you will regret that.I can't even know how it's play and how good it's the graphic
Theres a meaning for this game but for me....i dont know what the fly is doing
After 3 hours of gameplay, I found out this game is pretty cool and awesome. By the way ya this game needs a stronger PC to support it, the connecting needs more time than the others game. But it's fun playing it with friends.
Best ACTION game EVERRR
