The Following is an amazing dlc for this game as it adds more compentents to the game. Not only that but it's a decent dlc that provides heaps of content for players to enjoy. The story is strong and the ending has a massive twist, but i will let you find out what that is for yourself. The customising your own car/buggy is amazing as it is not just the same old parkour that you have in the original game, it adds the concept of scavaging almsot every car you come by to make sure you just have those extra screws and other items that you might need. All and all really good dlc with plenty of back story and has alot to offer, so far i've added an extra 15-20 hours to my overal dying light playthrough.9/10
Let me just start off saying that this game has Stamper as the narrator, and if you dont know who this person is then you need to youtube him... Awesome co-op game to play together with friends, or even on your own. Love the set challenges in each level where you have to collect a certain amount of green gems, golden yarn and complete it in a set time. Story is actually a sad one if you look past all the joking around and stuff ;-; Hatty ;-;
no hats
No hats :^}
ehhhhhhhhhh
Just no.
Awesome indie game, spent alot of time playing this game even more than most new fully developed games. The game is actually challenging which now days is what games are lacking in. There will be times where you feel like crushing your keyboard/controller but thats all added up to the fun and challenging factor8/10 would recommend to play.
