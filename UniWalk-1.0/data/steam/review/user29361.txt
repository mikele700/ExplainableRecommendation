For me the game works just fine!I think it's an awesome game if you like games where you just explore, this game isn't for everyone but I still like it. It's a very interesting game. Awesome concept for a game!Maybe if you people didn't over hype it so much then it wouldn't be too much of a problem.
This game is awesome, Having trouble to find any faults so far. The graphics are amzing, if you dont have a high end computer, you might be able to play this game but not at full quality.
If you love Naruto, then you will love this game. Getting to play as your favorite characters is awesome and seeing fights that always wanted to see. All. In. This. Game.
