My mate from school gifted me this 'fine' creation.We're no longer friends.'Nuff said.
I swear to god, if you start playing this game and yank out a f*cking tryhard WM+1 gibus pyro combo I will hunt you down and cram your keyboard so far up your *sshole you'll be sh*tting out keys for the duration of the following week at the least.I really don't care if you go all out 360_xXx_QwikSC0p3z_xXx_360 with the sniper or a raging scout, just stay the f*ck away from that flame casting, rage inducing, slightly cancerous maniac.Then again, I play as pyro so uh...Yeah... Hm.Shut up.Damnit, the salt is real.Good game though...11/10, would get constantly roasted by a WM+1 wearing queer goggles again. :)
You know that when enemy knights armed with blades of various sorts constructed from a fine, cold steel are casually doing 360s and doing f*cking ballet are managing to place clean hits on you...You-'ve really, found something special.11/10, -Really don-'t know what to say here.-
So, you've owned your all so powerful gaming rig for years now. You miss the emotional strain,  the constant struggle of a low frame rate and you wish to experience it once more.Well, you're in luck! For this abomination is so poorly f*cking optimised that your beast of a PC will barely be able to run it with a solid 1 frame per f*cking second!11/10, best uninstall simulator ever.
