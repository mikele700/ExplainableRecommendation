There is no where to start with the review of this game. It is just unable to be explained. Play it to see what I mean.It's good.
A great game. I found the story the be fairly well written and easy to follow, despite a few certain twists. I found the fighting very basic, yet at the same time, you could chain all your moves and feel like a total badass. You do not have to complete any of the side quests, and most of them are pretty useless. Overall i found the game to be a fun and enjoyable title.
