Comparing to the old boots on the ground like mw2 or even bo2.... this game is ♥♥♥♥ but it is also not bad. As i am progressing through the game i am getting used to thurst jumping and the movement and if i try to go back to boots on the ground, it would take me alot of time to get used to that.I wouldnt say this game is realllyyyy realllyyyy!! good But i still recommend it ;)
EPIC! BEST MMORPG I HAVE EVER PLAYEDI RECOMMEND GETTING THIS
