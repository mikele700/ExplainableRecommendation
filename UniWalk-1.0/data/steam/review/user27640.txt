Heroes and generals is a good game. it reminds me of battlefield 3 but set in ww2. i do have extreme frame rate problems but have been able to tweak it so its playable, it did used to be majorly pay 2 win but a few updates ago mostly fixed that, it is quite unbalanced in some places and there are various things that should be fixed like getting a machine gun on the gaz 67 and sidecars for the Russian and US motorbikes and extra vehicle for Russia US because Germany has the kettenkrad. over all good game but needs to be better optimized but as it is still in beta so it has some excuses.
gmod is amazing and is filled with hours of random things to do but heres what i thibk about the most popular gamemodesTTT: ttt is a detectives type gamemode where innocents are trying to find traitors before traitors kill all the innocents, it is fun but on my first few matches i was killed randomly with in 30 seconds. it is much more fun if you have friends.sandbox: probably the best mode and the default one. just mess around thats it, so its funRoleplay: no... just no.Guess who: my second favourite gamemode hunters trying to find players in a mass of npc's fun, so yea.Prophunt: fun until you get killed with in 30 seconds and have to wait till the round time counter is up because there is a prop that is really well hidden, dontcha just love waiting?murder sorta like TTT so same things apply, the exact same things.if you want to have some real fun your gonna need addons and lots of them so be warnedover all its fun with lots of things to do but is always better with friends     10/10 would nuke everything again.
WOW played it for 900 hours! so much fun
