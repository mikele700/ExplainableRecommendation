This game was brilliant up until the newest patch and DLC, which has effectively ruined the gameplay. The heightened revolt risk makes conquering nearly impossible without an almighty army and AI has reached an entirely new level of brutality. If you do get this game, try and find a mod or something which will put the game back to an earlier patch.
