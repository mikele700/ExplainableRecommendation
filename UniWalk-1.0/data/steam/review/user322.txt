Nether is a terrrible game. the graphics are lower than advertised, there a low amount of servers especially im my area (Australia). making it hard to play with the lag. The game is glitchy i found myself in the air at one point only to fall from the sky and die, vendors bug out and close conversation and no one play this game anymore. I regret bying this game as i bought the gold edition ( which is 20 usd more ) and i wish i could have a refund
