In one scene our protagonist, Kung Fury, pulls the arm off a Nazi, attaches it to his gun, spins it around and uses it as a helicopter. And now my PC is having a meltdown because it could not contain that much awesome.
You can probably see from the other reviews that this game is good. But how is the music? This is a game that lives or dies by its music. I'm happy to report that the sountrack is absolutely stellar. I immediately bought it after playing through just one zone of the game. Danny Baranowky brings his absolute A game to this whether it be through the Electro Ice levels, the Heavy Metal Fire Levels or the Funky Garden levels. I highly recommend this game to rhythm gamers and rogue-like gamers young and old, new or hardcore lovers of either genre and just everybody in general.
