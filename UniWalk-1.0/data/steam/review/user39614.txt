Fantastic - really enjoying this. The attention to detail is definitely a plus; from the orcs and their personalities, the terrain, the lore and the sense of immersion is really good. Then there's the Nemesis system, which is hard to describe but, if I had to, imagine if you will The Sopranos with Meat Cleavers, a grudge bigger than the Eiffel Tower and more infighting than the Vatican on Pope Election Day. You can pull up a pew and grab some popcorn for sure, or...you can jump right in and lay down some serious execution style moves - I recommend the later as it's f*cking head poppingly brilliant.  Seriously, buy it now, it kicks ♥♥♥♥.
