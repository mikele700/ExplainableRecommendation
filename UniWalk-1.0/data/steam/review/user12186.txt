TrackMania makes it's way to consoles, expanding it's borders and supposedly bringing many new players to the game. But it seems that Nadeo has forgotten about it's PC players. There isn't basic stuff like control remapping and proper graphics settings. There also aren't customisable skins or dedicated servers. The new art style is cool but after playing a little while I've noticed tracks that are IDENTICAL to previous games.Really disappointing.
A fantastic mod. Although it was much, much harder than the original game at points, it was very enjoyable and the soundtrack is awesome.It occured to me at the end of the mod that since Aperture Science and Black Mesa were rivals- they were set in the same universe... Mel's gonna meet whatever is left over from Half-Life 2...
A game that's far too good for it's own right. In the age of broken AAA games being released nonstop and $60 indie games with triple A marketing this game is a beacon of hope for games. Stardew Valley is developed by one person and is a polished, working game (can't remember the last time I said that). The art is well done and 60 hours in I've yet to encounter a bug. This game is absolutely worth every cent,
What Rust battle royale wants to be. Even for an early access game there are basically no bugs and it's polished as anything else. Absolutely worth getting(Also there are Australian servers now!)
