Evoland has been an excellent game to play, going through the evolution of videos games from a gray colored pixels to 16bit to 3D graphics then to HD graphics, as well as the gameplay and other details that have changed over the years, and its great that one of the puzzles uses a time travel mechanic from 16Bit to 3D HD Graphics (Past to Present). The Story itself is a bit short, but really the main focus of the game is the changes of graphics and gameplay, It's also nice to see that this game is freely inspired by many of the great RPG games we play today and you can see the many references to those games, such as the Legends of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Diablo and more.Now I'm not sure what happens when you collect all of the hidden stars but I'm pretty sure someone else has collected them all so you may have to search for a video about that.Since this game came out ages ago (April 4th 2013) I was very late to play it so I cant really say about the flaws of the game because it would have already been noticed (and also I'm not much of a massive critic), but I will say if you do start to play this game good luck finding all of those hidden stars and prepare yourself as you may find yourself a bit lost in some areas.Overall I really enjoyed this game, it touches a lot on the evolution of video games from pixel to HD 3D graphics with that little story and change of gameplay elements, I recommend this game this game to anyone!
If you like A Dark, Intense and Challanging Zombie game, and you like or want to kill slow Zombies, then No More Room In Hell is a game that is worth trying out, its a Free Download and a stand alone mod of Half Life 2, and you dont need Half Life 2 to play.
