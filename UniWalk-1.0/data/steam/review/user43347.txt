Where do i start, you do need a pretty good computer to sustain a game with high frame rate but once that has been achieved its a heck of alot of fun, surviving at the time of dusk running around trying to hunt for shelter and food is tricky at times but manageable, the servers bring a great deal of fun and excitement. Only con is there is nothing to aim with early game you have to guess and get use to playing with out a cross hair.But worth the practice and patients in learning the ropes of true survival.
12/10 amazing game well scripted, brilliant combat system and the mods are wounderful will recommend
