Its fun. Very funny, Very short. Simon Amstell is as wonderful as ever.Tightly scripted, very clean, very well executed. Did I mention it was short.. Too short. I want to meet the tiger. Which is perhaps,representative of the developers' anxieties about making a full feature. bahahaha..NO, just a joke. So.. i think i speak for a few people when i say:this is a great intro for an amazing, yet missing Game.At any rate, If you keep making these short things frequently enough,thats cool! i will play them all!More Please !
