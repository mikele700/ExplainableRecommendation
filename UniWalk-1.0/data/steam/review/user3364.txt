for a early acess free game this is actually pretty good, it has a few bugs but should all change in the future.
so good cant wait until it is fully released and there are more maps
this game is so good (: the plot of the game is definetley one of my favourites as well as having a beautiful scenery and well developed characters. the stroyline is just so well developed and intresting, i had trouble exiting cause i was just so hooked.i've seen other people hating on the game sying that the choices are pretty much A) yes B) maybe yesC)noD) maybe notThis is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, every choice in the game you make matters. for example, a companian may hate your choice if its descriminating against there kind or being a ♥♥♥♥ to that person or maybe threatining that person and stuff like that but the people you talk to remember everything you do. there was a merchant that i ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of and never sold me stuff again which also linked to piper disliking it. but you can also reach romantic levels with companians, for example right now im at max with piper, so when i sleep i get a certain perk for a period of time called lovers embrace or something like that.the main thing is this game is so ♥♥♥♥ing good and if you haven't, you should definitely get it
great game, fun for the whole family.
