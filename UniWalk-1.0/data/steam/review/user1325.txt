-Oi gimme your shoes-.Lad simulator, 2013 10/10
This game is fun, I give it that. HOWEVER, this game will not run to a satisfactory or even slightly tolerable level if your rig is a bit higher than the recommended specs. My computer is fairly decent, not the best, but decent. It says that my computer can handle it on the specs info but it doesn't. I recieved constant freezing, crashing and choppy and generally terrible fps (with all settings down the lowest and some additional launch parameters, which was a desperate attempt by me). So if you computer is good, you're fine but please keep what I said in mind. Thanks.
Good game if youre a fan of the series.
GREAT GAME MUST PLAY IT AND ITS CHEAP
