If you've ever wondered how playing poker with a dog feels like, along with a wacky robot, a murderous psychopath and a TV star/bodyguard with girls naming their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ after him, this is your game.You might need some previous experience with poker, because the bots don't go easy on you. When I first bought this game, I was being wooped. Because I had no clue of what I was doing. At all.The graphics are a delight. Music, exquisite. Fun, all the time.And, a personal tip. Don't drink if you're gonna play this.
