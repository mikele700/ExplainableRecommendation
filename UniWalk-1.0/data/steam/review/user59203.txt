Me: I am so hungry.My friend: Why?Me: Because i spent all my money on virtual hats instead of buying food.
Get it.
I remeber when i was in prep, i would have been about 5 and my teacher said - What do you want to be when you grow up?- and i said - A goat- everyone would laugh at me and say mean things but i always knew i would achive my goal and that i would show them all that i am the greatest goat. Now i have, i would like to thank coffeestain studios so much for helping me prepare for my future as a goat!
Awesome game, I will definitely lose sleep over thinking about what the ending could be.
Words of advice: if you hate lag in video games get this game on a console. there is so much lag on the pc version it was almost irritating to play.
Being a half life fan it was awesome to have put hundreds of conbine soldiers in a cage and blow them up with a nuke.
Its a good game, there is alot of bugs that need fixing but it was free!
Be ready to get all OJ Simpson up in here because this game is VERY violent. This game is a fast-paced 3rd person shooter so this game genre has been done to death what could this game possibly have to offer? Limetless weapon customisation, Yeah thats great what else? Make your own classes, and its free. In my personal opinion i thought that loadout was better than TF2. You need to try it. WARNING!! Its very addictive!
