Best Saints Row game in this series. The most fun i have had in a game of this type. This will definitely beat the newest one aswell. I recommend
This is one of the best FPS games i have ever played, although it is a good idea to get a beafy pc before you play
AN ENDLESS AMOUNT OF EVERYTHING!
this is one of the most badass games i have ever played... do wish somethings from SR3 was added though
a really good game in my oppinion, gets boring quickly though (unless playing with friends)
its a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome game
