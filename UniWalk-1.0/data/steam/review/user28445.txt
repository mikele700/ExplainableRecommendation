bought this game at release and it ran horribly.having said that after buying it from the summer steam sale (june 2016) game seems to be fixed and runs amazingly. keep in mind this is the PS4 version of this game so if you dont at least meet the recommended may run pretty terrible for you. gameplay well i played this far too much on PS4 but the frame rate made it harder to play it for long periods mainly because of the random drops that happened alot. but on PC at least with my PC setup it runs amazingly and constant 60fps in all parts and can see farther (render more enemies on screen without frames dropping). gameplay wise its more about you leading a squad of men to fight instead of solo like other dynasty warriors. will say the lack of controller support is annoying although can figure it out after a while but still a bad thing thoughall in all great gameonly negative is controller prompts does not work in game as in it shows keyboard buttons instead of controller.
if you want a FPS MMO that has 2000 players fighting per continent (3 continents = total players = 6000 atm), 3 factions each of them having unique weapons from each other and lore for each faction, focuses on teamwork instead of lonewolfing than this game may be want you want. I Highly recommend this game if you can run it since it seems to be a pretty draining on CPU. As a note if you do play this game it is highly recommended that you join a outfit/clan/guild to maximise the potential of this game.
i love this series got all of them (on PC only) and now this.reminds me of dynasty warriors but with nep nep.also the games runs great and 60FPS in game (at least for me) and nice options for PConly partial gripe is not really keyboard friendly (altho i do use a PS4 controller) will say mouse works fine though.Basically if you like neptunia games but wanted it to be dynasty warriors game then you will love this game.
