I love this game.I have followed it from glitchy, no content, no storage,to amazing, still kinda glitchy (Which i have 100% faith in fixes being made), full of content and constantly better graphics.I give this game a full 10/10 in not only its concept but the developers dedication.To say, the other day a mutant tribe decided to go all -Stop cutting down our forrest.- on me and i ended up killing the-'re entire liniage.The game had recently updated and i was having a seriously hard time cutting up bodies for my effergies and bone armor.Where i hit and the place a limb was being cut off were getting further and further appart. So to say, i had to hit the ground 1-2m away from what i was cutting to cut it.The next patch had solved the problem soo well i barely had to think when cutting up bodies.just cuts them where you hit. (obviously fixed the refresh rate on the axe damage positioning.WELL DONE TO THE FORREST TEAM.10/10 110%
Okay... So i thought this was going somwhere but once you beat the first level its the same.the same thing over and over and it just eventually becomes impossible.If you want a real progressive game where your people actually have some sort of prospects of survival get godus..thats what i wanted when i bought this and i got this. but now i have godus.I conclude... Repetative
