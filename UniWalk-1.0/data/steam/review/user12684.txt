-don-'t shoot me, im friendy-- is my trigger word!
first 10 mins of playing, see a rocket fly past head, hears arabic slurs being yelled through the mcom9/11 would praise allah again
though i havent put a radical amount of hours into this game it has a awsome replay value. this game is like a rough dimond it dosent look good form the grapics department however its -indie- art style gives it a awsome look to  some of the landscapes wich you dont need an expensive computer to run it on (even a peice of ♥♥♥♥ macbook can play this) overall a very good game well worth the GOTY edition because the DLC-'s are awsome and fun to play with friends given it was made a little while ago and you can sometimes pick it up on sale for a couple of bucks.
just such a fun game to play if you dont have alot of time, the reward system is cool and makes you want to play more and more games to get new gear, its fun and fast paced and dosent require grinding to get the good items, also the graphics are awsome and the phisics add a nice feel to the game. :D
