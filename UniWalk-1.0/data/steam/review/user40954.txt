Great game. Running through the jungle playing as your favourite dinosaur is so much fun. Kinda disappointing that there are no Australian servers so everything is 500 ping. Would be great to see more active community in this game that is based in Australia and get out own decent server.
Logged on for the first time. Decided to raid a base and got banned. 10/10 would play again.
