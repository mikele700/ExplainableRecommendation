One of the best third person MMORPGS out there, a smooth storyline, great graphics and amazing gameplay, it's incredible! The only con is that the gameplay may seem a bit confusing at first, but you hang on to it after a little while9/10

Gory but fun!
Sort of fun but gets boring after playing it for long. Pretty mixed but I don't really recommend it.
