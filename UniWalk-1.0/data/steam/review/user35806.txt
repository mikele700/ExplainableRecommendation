pretty cool game, all it needed was a bigger storyline
This game is extremely fun!People can go cry because the servers don't work, but seriously, I find the SP way better than MP, with a PASSION!This game is so obscure nowadays, share this game with others.Once you get into it, it's actually really challenging.I give this game 10/10 - Awesome.
My friend made me get this game.We are no longer friends.
Great Campaign, Great multiplayer (excluding noob tubers), Great Maps, Great guns, What more could you ask for?10/10 would join a laggy game again.
Pfft, Forget Half Life 3, Act 2 Act 2 Act 2 Act 2 Act 2 Act 2 Act 2 Act 2 Act 2 Act 2 Act 2 Act 2
