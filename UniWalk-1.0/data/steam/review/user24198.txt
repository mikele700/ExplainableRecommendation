Undertale is one of those games that aren't even games, they are adventures, adventures that take you to another place entirely and give you one goal, to beat the game, but you have the option to do more than just beat the game, you can make friends, you can become a genocidal maniac, but the one thing that this game does the best is, it hits your SOUL in any path you take, you always have the feels, you always have laughs, you always love the characters, because undertale is more than just a game, it is an adventure.Graphics- Who cares about that?/10Gameplay- Spaghetti/SpaghettiStory- Sada&Crying/Sad&CryingEXTRA RATING:Characters- The best there can be/100000000000000000000000000000Soundtrack- BlewMyMind/BlewMyMind
This game is just repeating the same joke over and over and over again and do you know why that joke is not funny now???It-'s just random stupid stuff that is happening in a random stupid world so should this game be worth buying???NO!Absolutley not the same joke over and over again is not funny you know what the joke is and they told you what it is they want this joke to be known fully by the player and that joke is,the game is buggy...Woooo 10--10 best game ever.NO stop your terrible reviews this review system is supposed to help new people to find great games on steam,but then these guys show up and their like-,HEY WOULDN-'T IT BE FUNNY IF WE ABUSED THE REVIEW SYSTEM.-Well guess the review system backfired for steam now everyone gets terrible games by terrible reviews.
The stories of fallout are amazing there is tons of lore to the game this game just kicks all of that lore into this huge expansive game it has different DLC's wich cover alot of the lore of fallout like Old World Blues,Old World Blues seems like my favorite expansion i never got to expirience it but the lore around big mountain is so good this game has a great story it has great personality and great graphics i think the graphics are better than new vegas by a little scrape on a wall though.So overalll:Story=10/10Graphics=8/10DLC story=10/10Expansion=10/10
I have played this game months ago i deleted it for space for some reason but u cannot just delete this game and get rid of this, this is just a fun addictive game even though I cant go on multiplayer because ping is like 1000 for some reason it may be just my computer but this game is fun even without playing with friends you have to struggle, get lucky, find your way out of that problem you made.
Like pikmin and shadow of the collosus together The pikmin part are when u can command the people to climb onto you or defend you and the shadow of collosus part is the titans never fought a titan yet though i cant wait
A very fun,Fast paced,Thirdperson shooter With amazing graphics that should Blow a persons mind.
