Top reasons to like: A new story and is somewhat fun. This game feels really likeable and re uses the models from Halo Wars. The enemies know how to play as far as AIs go.  Also most (will  clarify in cons) feel fair and fun to use. If your up for a challenge, replayability is good too.Cons: It doesnt have the features of the xbox one version (add them now developers and not as dlc). i really would like to do the co op with friends. You can also -buy- into the campaign with premium weapons that are insanely overpowered. A 400 shot auto rocket launcher..... really ._. .
If anyone thinks I am writing this because i hate RWBY, just to clarfy i love RWBY [rip pyrrha :'c ]Will keep this spoiler free by putting [REDACTED] at points to censor the spoilersNow what I find good first:+ Beautiful environments, feels like I am in the world of remnant+ Characters look good, as do the enemies+ Fluid combat system but... [will put in negatives]Now... Those were the only good things, bad things now- Every character play nearly the same except weiss which she can be upgraded to range spam- There is no immersion in the characters as their semblances dont exist here [eg Yangs rage, Blakes decoys that take the hit for her etc]- Enemies are repetitive as well and once you learn their patterns its easy to get around their guard [if i could learn in my playtime, something went wrong]. Even the [REDACTED] is stupid as you can pratically stand still most of the fight and wait fo [REDACTED] then attack the weak point.- Short and easy campaign. The defense missions are a joke as you can just let the ones attacking the centre to attack it and it wont matter at all- All the projectile shots do the same damage [i would expect rubies 50 cal to do more than blakes 9 mm]- Boils down to the same comboes on most enemies [eg. Yang, Ruby and Blake use Light, Light, Heavy to take out the lightest enemies in one combo]Bugs t_t # Playing singleplayer will cause you to lose the levelling progress on your character# Counters and Finishers wont register properly sometimes leaving you vulnerableOverall: This game was not what i was wanting in a RWBY game. If they release a huge patch I will check it out and rewrite this review. At this point on a scale of 1-10: 4/10, Not worth it
Is good
The xbox version is a ton better than thisFor one it tends  to close off on me.. and even when it did load it didnt register acheivements. I would definintely reccomend the xbox version over this because its ten times easier to use voice chat too. It also sucks in a sense of bad facebook and twitter opens
