It-'s a game that takes a lot of time and effort to become the best with any help with the past cs games, csgo has improved and enhance the level of quality and gameplay so much that it makes you go - what about half - life 3..- In which Gabe will reply - I can-'t count to three- knowingly as he said three, anyways the game includes guns with camos called -skins- by 7 year olds even though there is no animal or human skin on the fire arm itself, weirdos, with these -skins- user often do business with each other I order to get a certain gun similar to team fortress 2 but with the added bonus of that your -skins- help you kill the enemies, thanks a lot Hats. Not only that csgo also has a competitive mode where hackers and people who don-'t go outside all to much, go in and  err -Rekt face- but if you manage to avoid them and win enough games, this will allow you to rank up. YES! Rank up so you feel much better pulling that triggerOverall 69/10 would play all day
