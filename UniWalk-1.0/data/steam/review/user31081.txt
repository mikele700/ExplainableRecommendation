I for one personally love this game,the effect,sound effect,gameplay,monsters,concept.I love it! I can see this game has a very bright future and has endless potential to be a successful game.This game may still be in development of improvisation but the game just gets me.I love RPGs and ive played many but this one made my ♥♥♥ sore.One thing id like to comment about this game tho,its the queue time.OMG the queue time!! It came down from 15 to 10 min then suddenly got back up again to about 17 minutes or more.I really like to play this game frequently but it would be in void as if the servers are limited and not many.If the dev is reading this,please add some more servers to avoid queue time and people complaining about it. 12/10 Tacos
