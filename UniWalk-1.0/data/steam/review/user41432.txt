This has got to be one of the best racers I've ever played <3 I only ever originally played the first game and I loved it and only recently decided to give the other games a try. 2 I gotta say has to be not just one of the best racing games I've ever played but one of the best games I've ever played in general, same with the series FlatOut istelf, although 3 is a pile of ♥♥♥♥ by looking at the negativity, so might not play it unless I want a full and fair opinion of it. FlatOut 2 is game where the races never feels too easy like a lot of other racers, and never seems to get boring with it's amount of destruction and intensity it has.
