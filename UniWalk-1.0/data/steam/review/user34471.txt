A once great game that has become almost unplayable due to hackers and mods. New players  have no chance at all, they rage quit and don't come back. The developers are so busy trying to cater to the mindless percentage ( that has the attention span of a rock in a gold fish tank) with new flashing lights and bells that the game play has suffered to the point that long time players are now looking for other games to play. with no new comers and with veterans leaving, the writing is on the wall for this game, which is a shame, The simple graphics and fair game play were the best things about this game.
