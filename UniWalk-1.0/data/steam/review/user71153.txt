This game is amazing!! Ever since I bought the game I have been playing for hours endlessly. The story mode is great not to mention the pretty awesome characters you can unlock. The free play is mostly the fun part of this game. If you enjoy your LEGO games you will definitely enjoy this :)
The Best Game Ever!! Super powers are mind blowing and the missions are quite amazing as well. Having the DLC's makes this game super intense and playing it is ten times more fun. The vehicles haven't really changed much, although who needs cars and planes when you can sprint and glide around the city. The story is quite great and the gameplay just seems to get better and better. A must play for all Saints Row fans. 10/10
SR3 is one of the most amazing games I've played. The storyline is quite good and the game has fantastic graphics. Got me hooked for hours. The cars and weapons are quite awesome too although they should allow to degrade weapons.
