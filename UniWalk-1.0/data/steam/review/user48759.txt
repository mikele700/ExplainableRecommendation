if you dislike this game when you go to sleep at night ill be under your bed and when your asleep i will eat your doritos and drink your mounten dew and then turkey slap you
in what game can kick a grenade at people and also kick a cows head and make them vomit blood and ♥♥♥♥ into peoples mouth? ill tell you postal 2 duh but its a really fun game to play the dlc is ok not as good as the normal mode but if youre bored and want some fun buy this game and if you want to have even more fun get mods a use cheats to get all weapons my overall score is 10/10 its will give you a smile when you progress and the achevements are just plain funny
Unturned is a great zombie survival but its only in early access so dont complain if theres bugs or glitches theres even a bug report button. so my overall score in 100/100
i got to shoot nazis in the face a shotgun 10/10
