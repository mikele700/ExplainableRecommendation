This is one of my all time favourite games, and it's in Alpha! Prison Architect is a must play for ANYONE. It is brilliantly designed, has a unique art style and is rediculously fun.
One of the greatest games to come along in a long time. Absulotely brilliant. I lost about 3 hours into it the first time, thinking I'd been on for like 10 mins.
DayZ is amazing now that it has been updated. And it's still in alpha.
There's nothing more fun than driving through a building. A man takes on the world with a sledgehammer, one EDF building at a time.
Probably the best stealth game out ther, along with Hitman: Absolution. Game looks incredible, and runs at 100 fps on a laptop, however resolution only goes up to 1280 x 766. Spies vs Mercs is the best game mode EVER! Get this game, and get it now.
Saints Row 2 is the best game ever made. I cannot reccomend it enough, so if you don't have it, GET IT NOW.
