I-'m a fan of story. This drew me in with it-'s and made me feel what no other game has. If this isn-'t on your -To Buy- list, FIX THAT ASAP!!!
Highly reccomended. Puzzles start off easy then go right to the hair tearing until you remember -Oh wait....i can just use THIS sin!-. word of warning, some of the boss battles are irritating. one hit kills irritating. also those who don-'t want to pick this up because they don-'t want religion shoved down their throats (myself included) trust me, the game doesn-'t get preachy. you can pretty much swap out the theme for anything so don-'t worry. also reccomend grabbing a couple of xbox controllers and plug it in for some old school 2-4 player co-op.
Think GTA if it were on the NES. Worth it!
I waited three days for this game to be downloaded. As soon as I started playing it, I realised that it was TOTALLY worth the wait. if the graphics aren't a deal breaker, the gameplay will definatly seal the deal. A must have. (a FREE must have, i might add)
