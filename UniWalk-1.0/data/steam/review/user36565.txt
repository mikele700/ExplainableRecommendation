I use to love Rift. Quit WoW, started playing Rift... Had an absolute ball of a time. People would complain saying Rift is everything peope hate about WoW put into a solitairy game. I however found it very different indeed.From the way souls work to build your talent trees to the way you can customise your character. This game has everything. Constantly keeping players on there toe-'s with the -'Rifts-' and continuous entertainment with world and zone events. Much, much grinding to be done, but that is expected of any MMORPG out there. The graphics can be seen as anything from amazing to purely basic (dependant on what exactly your tlaking about) and the world zones are consistent. Raids and dungeons were done with scripting / ez mode / hard / etc. Population was a little low but thats why we could teleport through shards. All in all, after reading my next paragraph, if things hadn-'t changed I would still be a subscriber to this very day.My only issue with this entire game, it became FREE.... From that day: Scripting became lax. Pay 2 win became standard (anyone who says otherwise is a moron, you buy your in game real cash and trade that for proper   ♥♥♥♥ / vendor it = same thing).More crap has been released with an obvious half assedness about it.Greater population (positive?) - Half of which either beg for ♥♥♥♥ like plat or spam for help.Larger quantity of Quests that are pretty much replica-'s of quests seen early in the game.There is a multitude of issues I see with this ever since it went free. Personally, if it never got screwed over going F2P I would play more again. 3 characters all level capped with decent gear... waste of time. Ever since this game went free, i still paid subscription fee-'s but stopped playing... decided to install and try it out again... subscription cancelled. Would rather put up with the -oro por favor- spam on free to play WoW servers then play a game that isn-'t being cared for.
