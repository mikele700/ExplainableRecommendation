I'm a huge fan of Half-Life series, playing almost all Half-Life series except Decay, personally I think Black Mesa is extremely a very worthy remake of Half-Life, over a decade of development, the developer deserves the money for their hard work, although in this Early Access version there are so many bugs in there & there, but I'm very optimistic when Xen parts are released, this game will be almost free of ridiculous bugs & stable multiplayer.Regards
I must admit, Valve is doing great job in making this game, with beautiful updated Source engine, everything looks more & more great even to CS:S. In addition of that, CS:GO added several new CT & Terrorist factions, new weapons & equipments, also there's customized weapons skins & many, many things have changed. Totally a must have for Valve & CS series fans.10/10
Valve is doing great job for porting DotA into advanced Source engine so the graphics is awesome. Must have for DotA big fan!
THIS GAME IS AWESOME!
