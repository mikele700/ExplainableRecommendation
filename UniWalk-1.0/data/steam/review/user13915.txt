Feels like Black Ops 3 without killstreaks. Oh yeah, and I can headshot people with the knife for an instant kill.Some minor gripes:Devs please let me rebind the ability key, and fix the bloody sensitivity on sniper ADS.
Even my crappy laptop can run this game! Although when i initially joined a server, the game froze for a few seconds to load the map, but after that, no framrate issues whatsoever!
pretty fun!
There's still plenty of people playing this game, don't worry about not finding a match.Oh and ignore the small number of hours, I just haven't touched singleplayer.
