Very thrilling game with lost of cool features, could reccomend it to anyone into action sports or anyone looking to have a great time on the mountain.Some of the things that would make this game one of my all time favorites is; support for first person view with oculus, sound effects and music, powder and snow interaction, and snowboarding.
