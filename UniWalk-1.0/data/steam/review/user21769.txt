Good game, must take friends with you or make friends. This game cannot be played by your self! However in saying that it is rather rewarding to see every player par take with eachother to live and make some of the nices communities unlike some other games we know.
Its a quick fun game, if you are looking for something like Path of Exil or dontwant to buy Diablo then this game is right up your path.The only CON i can think of is based on my location as I am in Aussie playing at around 7PM the option for PVP is pretty much out of the question, I cannot speak for level 10 Devian and higher though. (eg 3v3 or other pvp instances ) this is based on the 20v20 open to all.Side note dont pick zerker for 20v20 pvp  its a good challenge ( normaly wont win if more than 2 ranged )PROS you can 1v1 anyone :D  even at half health.store is great and game is rather simple for those wanting some quick fast action.The games PVE content picks up in difficulty around level 25.Anyhow thats about it for my below average review :D
Nothing but great!, this is a must buy. So many hours of fun waiting for you in this game.
