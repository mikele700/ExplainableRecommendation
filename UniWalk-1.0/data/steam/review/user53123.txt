Never complain when a game if free to play, never winter is a new and exciting world waiting for everybody to explore.  For what this game seems to be it is definitely worth a go, you can't really judge a game based on reviews until you play it yourself and see what it has in store.Only played a few hours so far and its been very enjoyable, looking forward to playing more!
