Well firstly the game needs more people, the classes should get more weapons, the bunny should jump the same height as other classes, more classes, more health, more a lot of stuff.But the gameplay seems fine and I think I know a group who would like to play this game...
This is good... I can work with thisTime of dragons is fun as hell and the gameplay is like Dragon: the game and warthunder mashed together but there are just some thing I would like improved and in the game- a firstperson view- Make more better dragons cost more DNA- Make it so you can choose servers- Make more gamemodes- Make the guns take more shooting time before they overheat- Make it so your dragon can go on the groundBut it is a good game
Play on mac, crash when you try to join or make a game
The player Manual is the sentry operating manual. I think they misplaced them both
When you find out the Fubar is the best weapon and you use it all the time and then when you check your achievements and only need 1 more kill with one to get the achievement.10/10 will be unlucky again with achievements again

Great game. Played only 9 hours and now I know most of the map and can get pass everything without dying.
This is a great game and the sequel looks great too so anyone who says its bad definitly have not played it or else would of said that they loved it.
One of the reasons why I got this is because I liked retro-evolved but when I played it there was no retro-evolved like mode so I didn't play to much untill I heard the developers released an update saying that a retro-evolved mode was getting added so I started playing again and I say it was worth it.Also the developers should add a part where players can make their own levels and add it on workshop
