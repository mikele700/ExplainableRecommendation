It's very short, like extremely short, probably to the point where it actually makes the game not worth the full $20 it is asking for here.But I absoulotely love the art style of this game, infact thats one of the main reasons I bought this, I didn't get tired of the style of the world once, it's just so lovely :))The story starts of strong but tends to lack after the main plot twist as there isn't much progession/interesting plot points but I still cried at one point :((Despite the shortness and price, I am still in love with this game, just everything sorta just seems to work.Still, if you are going to buy this, wait for a better sale as I still believe its not worth the $20 its asking for
