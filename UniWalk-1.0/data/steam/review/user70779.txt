The community in this game is terrible! Today I played a competitive game on inferno, and I ran into some very rude people! I simply wanted to hunt down all the chickens in the map. I was wandering around when suddenly I was shot at by a very rude person. Someone on my team then proceded to yell at me for not shooting him.Volvo, however, puts excellent updates into the game. For instance - -Increased max chicken population from 10 to 12-, in a recent update of which many people are calling -the best update ever-. This is a good step in the right direction for Volvo, as increasing the max chicken population will ensure that players are never tired of completing the game.Best parts of the game:-Chickens-Best chicken killing simulator ever-Polar Bear dreamhack stickers (check out my P90 and p250)-Chickens-Moar chickensIssues that must be adressed:-Some maps don-'t have ANY chickens-In a 10 man competitive match there aren-'t enough chickens for everyone-Chickens should not have teleport hax-Chickens need more HP-Chickens-There is currently no way to cook the chickens-New players may find killing chickens difficult (steep learning curve)-Chickens-Chickens do not do enough damage-Too many players in a map distract you from the real game-Same thing goes for trees and crap10/10 chicken simulator.
