Dont be put off by my hours, I probably had hundreds before this came to steamPros:-Tons of different biomes and scenarios give heaps of replayability-Unique events always make sure you have something to deal with-Great developer who always communicates with the community-Lots of work put into making colonists feel human-Decent combat system -Good UI-Lots of variety to how you build your base-Complex injury system-Hardly any bugs or crashes-Nice art styleCons:-Making a base that isn't either built into a mountain or surrounded by mountains gives you a big disadvantage, especially on higher difficulites-End game can be a bit lacking, either build a spaceship and escape or eventually get overrun by raiders.Overall a fantastic game well worth 30 USD.
