The best Lego game yet, and pretty much the best Marvel game as well, a terrific mix between the cinematic Marvel universe and more comic aspects.Like all Lego games, Lego Marvel Super Heroes features a good mix of fun and humour for both kids and adults, my six year old and myself loving every minute of it. The sheer size of the New York City hub, combined with such a large roster of playable characters just make running around smashing or racing fun. Definitely recommended.
Terrific superhero game, and one of the best examples of a good F2P conversion
Terrific game, a delight in humor and game play. My son and I love it
The latest PC game incarnation of the classic BattleTech simulator series, MechWarrior Online offers a unique gameplay experience for a nominal F2P shooter game, slower paced and more tactical. There are few things greater than piloting a BattleMech stomping across the battlefield to slug it out with other 'Mechs.
I still had my copy on CD, such a lovable game :)
Such an amazing different game, the head visuals are insane. Cannot recommend enough.
While has some niggling crashes, the very enjoyable MMO GTA game I dreamed of
An amazing game only enahcned by free to play,
Less serious than GTA4, but very fun :)
