Its a fun game.Until The GLITCHES GET YOU!SO MANY GLITCHES!!!sometimes my house will just get cut in half and the other half wont be there.when i saved my game and came back the next day, sothing i did was still there...i spent like 4 hours on some base and it just disappears. But this game is in Alpha so its understandable.Please FIX these glitches before doing anything else!These glitches just ruin the game
