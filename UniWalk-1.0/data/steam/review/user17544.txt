One of the best shooters of this generation; an older game that has well and truly held up over the years. Faultless gameplay, erriely chilling atmosphere, well-crafted story; Bioshock is a fun play that's beautiful to look at. The second part is weak, and lets the game down a little. The missions are shorter, and the last boss is mediocre at best, but this doesn't ruin the experience. Highly recommend. Well worth the $20.
