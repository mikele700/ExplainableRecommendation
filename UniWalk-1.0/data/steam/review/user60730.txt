This game.... WowI will tell you what I like about the game.First thing thats very major to me... CHARACTER CREATION!!! ALL OF MY F%^KING YES!!!You can make your character either Good or Evil, look like you or total randomness, don-'t even get me started on the movement modes and powers, OH BOY!powers are what you are going to use as special abilities and your combat role, like if you choose Rage from the War of The Light DLC 1, you are going to have attacks that heal you, and have a Tank combat roleMovement modes are very little, there was only 3 before, but know there are 4, the 4 are...Flying: Makes you fly around the city of Gotham or Metropolis like Superman with ease, a bit slow at first, but getting super sonic makes it go MUCH quicker, GET THIS ONE!Acrobatics: Parkouring in a nutshell, choose this if your a Batman fan, but when you try to use it, enemies attack you and make you get out of movement modes, which is why I despise...SUPERSPEED: OMG THIS ONE SUCKS ANYTHING LONG AND HARD, THIS ONE MAY MAKE YOU GO SUPER FAST LIKE HELL, BUT THATS WHY IT SUCKS, SOMETIMES YOU CAN GO TROUGH THE SKYBOX BECAUSE OF IT, AND DO I NEED TO MENTION THAT YOU GET ATTACKED BY ENEMIES LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, FOWARD AND BACK, MAKING YOU LOSE YOUR SPEED ALL THE F%^KING TIME!Skimming: Dunno, don-'t have it yet... it has to do with hovering though.... XPAnd back to customization, you can have mentors, the good mentors and what they do are...Batman: Has the most interesting storyline, and tech-like gear, but has the hardest difficulty.Superman: Very easy difficulty, but at the cost of least interesting storyline, also gear looks like bio engineered stuffWonderwoman: Oh boy, this one has a medium difficulty and a medium interesting meter to its story, also gear you it from this look like roman armor.Now for the villians.Joker: Batman-'s but evilLex Luthor: Superman-'s but evil, and I feel no one understands him.Circe: Again, copy and paste of Wonderwoman-'s BUT EVIL!Now, up to one of my only complaints...I FRIGGN WISH THAT HAL JORDAN AND SINESTRO WERE MENTORS, THAT WOULD INCREASE MY PLAYTIME BY OVER INFINITY, I F%^KING LOVE THE GREEN LANTERN COMICS TO DEATH, AND I DEMAND THEM TO BE MENTORS, MAKE IT HAPPEN SONY ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT, FOR ME AND MY FELLOW GREEN LANTERN FANS OUT THERE!!AND!If you chose good, a helper named -Oracle- helps you on your journey, but if you choose Evil...YOU GET MY FAVOURITE NPC IN THE GAME; CACULATOR!!! HE IS SO HILARIOUS YOU WILL LAUGH ALL OVER THE FLOOR AND HAVE TEARS OF JOY!Oh yea, forgot about the combat system... oops...Anyway, you choose your weapon in the  creation, and you click the left mouse button to do melee attacks, while right gives you ranged attacks, don-'t forget to use your super powers still...Oh, the story to, drat...The story is that Brainiac wants to conquer the multiverse, meaning he has to conquer Earth (Again Brainiac? Didn-'t I whoop you in Scribblenauts Unmasked when you tried doing that?) and he succeeded, UNTIL Lexy went back in time and warned the Justice League, and put Exobytes (The things that give you your powers) in the Atmosphere, giving people powers... Not going to spoil anymore, play it yourself and enjoy!And thats my review in a nutshell, hope you enjoyed my rant about superspeed, me ranting about how much I love the GL comics (IF YOU DON-'T HAVE ONE GET ONE!) and Caculator being frickn hilarious, put your opinion of the review in the comments, I can deal with Positive and Negitive.
I LOVE anime rpg-'s, and with the new class path for ADD (My favourite character) releasing soon, I feel I have to hug my computer screen with thoughts of how the new class path will be like.Pros:^^^^^Multible playable characters you can costumize.^^^^Great combat system^^Sidequests feel like they are worth the grind^^^Great NPC-'s^^^^^^^^Great storyline^^Pets^^^^^^^^^^YOU CAN BE F$%KING ADD FOR F$%KS SAKE, ADD!!!!Sadly... this game has cons to...Cons:!!!!!If you want to speedrun, you can-'t, enemies seem strong further.!Some enemies have to be beaten with a group.!!!Towns can get a little hard to remember.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PVP has cocky players that when you get beaten by, tell you to -Git gud, scrub.-!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Costumes disappear after a week (except accessories)And thats all I can say about the game so far... Did you enjoy my review? Leave your opinion below, I can deal with good OR bad, I want to know!
As a fellow pyromaniac, I brought this mod pack...I can easily defeat shields now...I can burn everything that stands against me...I CAN LAUGH LIKE A MANIAC... BHAHAHAHEHEHEH!9001/10 Would watch trailer and burn people again
I cannot explain it well. Just watch Yahtzee Croshaw-'s review on Zero Punctuation. He can explain it better than me.-I am the Milk-Man, my milk is delicious.- - The Milk-Man, Psychonauts.
