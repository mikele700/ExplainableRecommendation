I thought from the moment i saw the tralier this would be a good game even after ACM but this game is amazing when u dont see the alien your wondering how long before he/she/it jumps out at you but when u do see it your tempted to run....DONT.... Just Dont..... its kind of clunky and annoying in playing but it works in favour of the gameplay as it just makes you feel even more under-powered against the damn thing. after and hour of gameplay im finding i just want to keep playing its everything i hoped it would be, totally blown away and scared to death by the experience so far definity worth picking up even at full price. Also being in a vent turning around and seeing it crawling straight towards you is the scariest ♥♥♥♥ ever
I have barely even open the game but i dont need to, to say this is 1 of the best games ever made i spent countless hours on this game in my childhood and i never even got past the first park scenario because i just wanted to keep playing it 10/10now all i need game wise is the 3d version of Frogger and CROC
This is a great game theres lots to do u can mess around with the main campaign for a while and if u need a rest you can go on 1 of many side missions/time trials-etc.Great part of this game is thers no class lock, at the start of the game u get to choose between 4 or so classes after which u will get your guns for that class in the tutorial but as soon as thats ended you can find and use any weapon from any class and use it as much as u want.you can even equip 2 of the same weapon as primary and secondarythis is an online mmorpg but if your worried about geeting somewhere in the game only to be killed but another player dont worry PVP in this game isnt forced you can interact and team up with other players other wise if u want PVP you can approach some1 and have a duel or you cango find a siege which makes players battle it out in TDM styled gameplay - but all PVP is opt-in onlyFor $10 this game is well worth it
Great Action adventure game which is based around when lara was young this story is what makes her the hard core survivalist we see in the other games and movies.after getting through half the campaign you start to wonder how much more she can take and how long has the game got to end but after an amount of gameplay time and concentration you will gather the whole story which is quite interesting after 13 hours played i am at about 75% of the way through although i keep going back and gaining every collectible i definatly recommend buying this as it is a great game with an awesome storyline
Great Game with an epic campaign a bit short but well worth it definitely recommend for people who love action--adventure games and also has a bit of problem--puzzle solving, story line ends kind of suddenly but is picked up in Tomb Raider: Underworld, if u like this game i also recommend getting the rest of the trilogy (Tomb Raider: Anniversary, and Tomb Raider: Underworld)
