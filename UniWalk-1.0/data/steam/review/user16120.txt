Very simple to understand shooter, just click on people.minor issues with balancing of the classesMajor issue with spawn camping tho.not really a game i would keep playing but worth it for short bursts of fun if i'm bored
confusion, if you like it, play this. it burns mah bloody brain
Great puzzle game when you're bored.
headshots.
probably my favourite realistic shooters, Explosions are annoying and RPGs make me wanna kill myself but the mechanics are great. tho i would want to see better gun balance for each class as certain weapons are completely inferior and theres no point using them.Survival is fun af tho, running around the map.  11/10 would Jihad again
