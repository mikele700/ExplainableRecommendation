I like this game quite a bit, there are much better MMORPG-'s with the same non target style but you don-'t come across as many as you think. Some pros are:- The Aforementioned action style combat rather than tab-targeting system- There is item enhancement and auction house (ala Archeage, WoW, etc)- The PVP aspect of the game (May be a problem for many people but that-'s why the PVE server was made)- There are quite a bit of classes to choose from (gender locked with certain races like demon gets top and bottom male and middle female, and humans get top and bottom female and middle male, so it sort of evens out.- Quite a good amount of people for a slightly new MMO- The skills are a bit less then most MMO-'s but they are easy to get as you can get most in about 3-5 hrs- Enemy-'s are fun to fight and the game is quite difficult (depending on the class you choose- You don-'t have to grind much unless your going for lvl 40 (good luck) really quickly- PVP is great due to the aforementioned action style combat- The download isn-'t so much so great to try out for a bitEven thought I say it-'s a good game, it-'s got quite a bit of cons- Graphics are not as good as most new MMO-'s (I don-'t care but some people do)- High lvls can spam kill newbies depending on their moral compass- The server is pretty stable but I ran into a few server glitches and some 10 second disconnects because of the server-  I ran into a few bugs ( one including when I started the game Fluffy got stuck inside the wood of a carriage) but not that many- Some spelling and grammatical errors- Many things you can buy but not -Pay2Win- (Mostly cosmetics and mounts but there are weapons.I like this game and I am still playing it, as long as my internet holds up :(. I seriously recommend you play this with a friend because you can team against bosses and dungeons, do quests, and you will run into many pvpers on your journey so having more than one person will usually grant you your win, or intimidate your opponent. I recommend it and I will hope to see you out there :)
A nintey cent candybar or this game seeing as the game doesn-'t do a single new thing and is around an 1hr of click dead click dead click and you win I woul dchoose the candybar. (What do you guys see in this game -never seen anything like it!- LIES!)
This is pretty good. I can't really explain.
