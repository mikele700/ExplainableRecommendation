This game features many different terrains/environments, as well as an extremely large playing field. Unlike many other FPS games this game allows the use of Highly technological equipment including mobile units. I have not spent any money on this game yet as nearly all gameplay-affecting equipment are obtainable through playing the game and earning credits. But, I know that this choice does not appeal to everyone, so if you don't have much time, and would not like to spend money on this game it would take quite a while to progress.
