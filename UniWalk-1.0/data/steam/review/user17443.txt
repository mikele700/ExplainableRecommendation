This games physics are insane, this game is probably next-next gen. 10/10 Made a shrek character and destroyed every other player 
Garry's Mod. This game, This game manThis game has given me some of the best times i've ever had in a video game. And personally, i couldnt recommend it any more. The good: Amazingly entertaining Dope physics Great variety of game modes Mostly good communtiy Darkrp is awesomeLively community Some really nice textures in some placesI can't think of much else, it's to good!The Bad:Some annoying kids on TTT or Darkrp serversSome server conntections Can't think of anything else, It's to good!I honestly couldn't recommend this game anymore than i already have. This is one of the best games i own95/100
What can i say, this game IS the poster boy for Next-Gen.  Being a goat is like being a god to me and this game made me feel like i was the god of gods, the alpha god. The game story driven gameplay gets you so immursed you feel like the game isn't a game anymore, it becomes reality. A lot happened to me early in 2014, i watched my parents die right in front of my eyes so of course i retreated to video games. Goat Simulator saved my life, after my parents died i became deeply depressed, i was planning to off my self but then i picked up Goat Simulator, and life became beatiful again. In conclusion, all i have to say is: Goats are like dogs, but they're not. Goats also eat cans, so goat CAN do anything; Goat Simulator CAN do anything.10/10
