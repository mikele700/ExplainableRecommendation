TF2 is a truly addicting FPS game starring nine classes, The Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Medic, Sniper and Spy. After playing you will start to notice players with different weapons and cosmetics. Soon after I had at leat a few hours in the game I decided to buy new weapons and hats... FROM THE MANN CO STORE. I went around showing off my australium gold mann co cap for a while until I realised it wasn't really a good hat, (And I Discovered The Market.) I then got addicted to buying hats and weapons. Once I got to 1,000 hours on the game I started spending more money and playing pubs and competitive. I started doing better in games and bought unusuals australiums and expensive skins. I've spent at least $400 in this game. GG Gaben, GG.
