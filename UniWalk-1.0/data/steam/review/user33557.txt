This is such an addicting and masterpiece of the game. It is seen as being difficult and something to just rage- quit, but after all your death, you see that death becomes a lesson, the combat hard to strengthen you, and the rewards have the greatest feeling of accomplishmnet. Dark souls is a game I strongly reccomend for only the most persistent and dedicated gamers.
