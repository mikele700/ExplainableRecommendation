would not reccomend if money is important to you
If you have that kind of imagination that never ends... GET THIS GAME FOR THE SAKE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD.
Absolutely incredible and interesting new approach on zombie survival, and to top it off it was all done by one young individual! Great fun, well worth the 5 dollar upgrade as well.
If you like naked men baring rocks chasing you across a landscape full of kos players who live in scrap metal houses, then I can highly reccomend this game.
