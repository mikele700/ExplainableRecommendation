If you ever wondered what its like to be a Clone Special Forces Commando in the Star Wars Univers, with a mix Dark, Intence, and some decent gun play, this game could possably be for you, although the game might not be as flashy as our current gen games, it still looks and feels nice to play. I recommend this to any Star Wars fan out there or anyone who loves Clone Troopers.
