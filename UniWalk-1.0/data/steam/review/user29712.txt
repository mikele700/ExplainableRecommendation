I hate Fallout series. Ive tried but never gotten into new vegas or fallout 3.I loved skyrim and love elder scrollsi LOVE fallout 4. it feels different in a way but more fun. i am really enjoying this game and advise anyone who like exploration, looting and hundreds of quests to pick this up.even settlements and upgrading weapons and armor is great.Its good to see a game where everything lootable can be used. Spent 20 mins searching for alluminium cans. fun times
