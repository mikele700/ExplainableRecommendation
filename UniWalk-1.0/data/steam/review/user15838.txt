Really fun game, i actually like it, although, it would be nice to get some DLC, there's hardly any...
i literally finished the game in 5 mins, it's not really worth $2, i thought there would be a bit more gameplay involved. It's ok i guess
This was a great game, amazing storyline, but words cannot express how great it was
I personally say that this is my favourite game of ALL time, better than minecraft and better than GTA V. All the add-ons to the game are beyond imaginable. You can add almost anything you can think of from, Planes, Cars, Weapons, Huge maps, items and even things from other games!. I give this game an overall score of 1 billion out of 10 and i definetly recommend it. :)
It is technically a fireplace simulator with an odd storyline, you buy ♥♥♥♥ then you burn it
