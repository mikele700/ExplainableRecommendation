My review is in parts:1- The CharacterPros: Aussie, Punk, Has funny linesCons: Almir-'s Beard (god save me)Overall its a nice character, deserves the hype that was going around it.2- The Gun (Bootleg)Pros: Barely need to reload, Looks Cool, Reliable for Deathwish (If you mod it right that is), Its called BootlegCons: The Magazine cant be used for other gunsAs i said, its good on Deathwish And is good with Crowd Control3- The Melee weapon (Wing)Pros: Cool charging animation, You can be The Spy, High ConcealmentCons: Low Damage, A Bit slower than Normal knives like the switchblade and the URSA4- MaskPros: It Has the Australian flag colors on it (aswell as the stars), The -Begins- Version is Pure WhiteCons: Looks a bit like Bonnie-'s Mask5- Perk Deck (Anarchist)Pros: Its Grinder but for armor, Turns armor on your suit from 20 to freaking 158Cons: Slow armor regenTL;DRThe Character pack is good, i-'d rate 7/10
