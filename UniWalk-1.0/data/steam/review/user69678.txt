omg i love this game so much. It was so much fun being in the game. It was like a movie but instead of watching it, you were in it. Almost made me cry at the end :'). once you start to meet all the characters and know who they are you. The game becomes more real for you. At the end you wonder what happens next and thats what made me want to buy the next season.
