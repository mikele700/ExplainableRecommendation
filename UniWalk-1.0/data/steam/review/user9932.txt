Still one of my favourite RPG games, the enhanced edition with Tactician Mode is just what I needed.
> named a soldier after my girlfriend> go on a mission> girlfriend gets killed> reload mission> repeat 5 times> gg saved girlfriend finally> gg its only the second mission10/10 would save her again
Always love more customisation options. They look great too.
New alien mechanics and typesNew weapons New story missions New cosmetic features. Not bad for $10
Very fun game. Reminds me of the hack and slash games I used to play when I was a kid, but harder :)
