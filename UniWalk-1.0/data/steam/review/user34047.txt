The game title just says it all. It's awesome. It's Bloody FUN. Originating from PS3 and the Xbox Live Arcade, Awesomenauts lives up to it's name for being a awesome space 2D MOBA with plenty of hilarious characters with their themes. Although I had bought this game for $3.33 dollars from a steam sale, I can clearly tell you that paying the full price of 10 dollars, is completely fine when considering the game mechanics and the ability to keep having continuous fun. One of my favourite casual games, with the cartoony child-like art style, the most comfortable innovating soundtrack and as mentioned previously......THE AMOUNT OF FUN GUARANTEED.
