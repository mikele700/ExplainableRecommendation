Is preeeeeeeeeee gooooo
Why in the ♥♥♥♥ did I buy this game. Kill me with a spoon.
This is a very ewll made game.
Yeah na not bad
This is a pretty chilled game. (No pun intended). I like to play it whilst listening to music and relax. There are a few bugs and glitches, but that is to be expected from a game in BETA. Any way it's all round pretty fun.
Really great game. Give it a go. It's really underpriced and DLC comes out quite a bit and its always free. Also there is a great worship community.
Is good no
is guud
Lots of glitches and a bit fustrating making/ joining a server. But Its okay. 5.5/10
