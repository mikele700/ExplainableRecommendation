Never listen to what the crazy people that write marks on the ground say... believe it or not that cliff is not the pathway to narnia!
I was hyped i will admit but after beating the game in 1 hour and what they said would be in the game not being there, i have to say that i dont hate the game, i hate the developers. YOU WANT ME TO PAY FOR DLC! WELL GO ♥♥♥♥ YOURSELF TOO
