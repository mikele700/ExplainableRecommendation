new update sucks. im deleting the game for 2 major reasons. 1: the crate system is horrible. the currency system was so much better. 2: the tech tree was awesome. but now they removed it and scewed over the game becuase now it is completley random. plz bring back the old game everyone loves.
this is already a brillant game even though it is still in early access. There are updates every 1/2 weeks and these  are normaly big updates and the crafting system  is awesome including the new camp system they put in.
Great game with funny phyics.
