the modding capability is AMAZING if you love funny shoot em up games this is for FRANK no thats not my name THATS YOURS
Unturned is a Blocky zombie survival game, Its kinda like dayz but is mostly fun in its own way. The itesm that you can get and the clothes well basically the variety of things that the gameplay offers is just amazing I have really enjoyed it so far and have learnt so much from it so for me I give it a 10/10 for a early access game I think it has alot of potential
Brawlhalla is a piece of work that must be experienced to truly understand. Using the same concepts as the Super Smash Brothers series it can be a bit hard to master, but Blue Mammoth games has knocked it out of the map with this one (pun intended). with a wide range of different characters to choose from and a large variety of weapons to choose from Brawlhalla is a fun game to play with friends even through all the blood, sweat, salt and tears.My Regards Rangerada is best character pls buff and nerf thatch is too op
Great game, loved the story and the zombies mode was amazing, definetly a good buy if it's on sale.
Great WW2 game, all the weapons are great and equal, it's a pay2notgrind kind of game because you can get everything in the game from just playing and there are no items that you can't get with the special currency that you can't get with the normal currency
If your looking for a game like call of duty or something but not all hardcore and stuff well this is the game for you oh yeah I think its........................................EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! guts
