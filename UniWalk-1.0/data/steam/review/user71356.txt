Very fun game. very rich story line which flowed really well. I absolutely love this game.But there is always one issue. I WANT MORE!!!The story mode is only 3 hours long at a slow pace. The shorts at an absolute most are 1 hour. Developers, please make more shorts/dlc or even a new octodad. I would happily pay an extra 10USD for 5 extra shorts. I loved the game but I was sad when I completed it, I want more!!!
FSX = BaeMust buy!!!Also, if you have a couple hundred dollars in your wallet, I reccoment buying the hotas warthog thrustmaster. Trust me, it is worth every cent and has never failed me.
Well there is no other review I can give to this rip-off of CS that doesn't even work
One finger death punch is Bae. It's simplistic design and easy controls makes this game easy to pick up and play. The difficulty of the stages progress at the same pace as your ability and there are very few levels I find too easy or too difficult. If you have $5 in your steam account, I recommend you prioritise this game over any other item of the same price.
I love game dev tycoon, you can create dream game genre and what sort of game it is (action, adventure, etc.). The thing i love the most is the feedback the reviewers give to help create better games.
