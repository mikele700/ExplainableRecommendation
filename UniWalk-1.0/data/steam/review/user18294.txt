Tower Unite is a great game but you will need to wait a month or two for there to be more content and things to do.It has some bugs but runs well on my 630m; Yep a laptop GPU on the lowest just fine. How ever maxing this game out isn't the best thing to try and due to optimization issues. It may look terrible on the lowest but it's fine for now.Multiplayer got fixed a few hours ago and servers were quick to update to the fix.Condos have so much potential just like the game and gamemodes which is planned for the future.You have the basic gamemodes.Minigolf, Ballrace, Virus and Planet-something (never seen it before) many things are almost complete and just need finalizing so it won't be long till there's more things. If you are on a budget this is a great game and it's worth the price.
Its alright, VAC security needs to be upgraded
