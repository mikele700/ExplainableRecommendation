We tried to include a little walkthrough for the first part of the game as we had some trouble finding our way around. Watch out for rampant boxes and pillows as you make your way through this spooky mansion owned by your dear uncle (we're not really sure but we like the premise). Enjoy ! 7 out of 10! - Big Fams Gaming

As always the further you get into the night the harder things get. This game revolves around 4 light boxes that you must keep on. 8/10. -Big Fams Gaming
