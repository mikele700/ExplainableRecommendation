Sometimes, if you try to solve any of the puzzle in Antichamber by just the theory of logic and physics, won't always work. You need to think, using your brain, discover phenomenons thoughtout the rooms to find the right way to solve. The methods are not expacted, but... meanful. The creator of this game can carry out the message clearly thoughtout my journey.Impressive Game for me.
This not just finishing the story, challenge other players' level and train your brain to the limit!
