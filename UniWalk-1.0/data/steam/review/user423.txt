I want to figure out the downsides while outlining the positives. This game has lots of action included, its a real challenge but some weapons seem hardly usable in fights. Rockets are good as short burst damage output, but they can be easily dodged and the player usually switches weapons after. Theres hardly any time for sniping, easpecially in relatively small maps,Other than that, the weapon customisation is great and its fun to try out combos. Really gets your heart pumping and the taunts look amazing. 8/10
