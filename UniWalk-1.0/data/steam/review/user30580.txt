A very addictive First Person Shooter than many claim to be a -Hat Simulator.- The trading aspect can be very gripping, although it is not hard to let yourself go back into the pub or competitive aspect of this lovely game.As long as you-'re down with the lingo and the general mechanics of the game, you should be alright, although all of this comes with experience. All in all, I rate this a well earnt 9.5/10 that has given me more than 1,900+ hours of addicting fun!
