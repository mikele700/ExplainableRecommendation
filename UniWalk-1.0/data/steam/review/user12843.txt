Its amazing how most people who have Arma 2 have over 500+ hours in it. I think it is safe to say this game is something that will always stand above every game out there. The sole mod, DayZ, is the reason that hundreds of new survuival games such as ARK and DayZ Standalone(even though it is ♥♥♥♥) came out. Sadly DayZ died and most servers are dead except for the few heavily modded servers. The memorys we all share in this game are legendary and will stick with us forever. I don't think it is fair to rate this game anything, but rather place it in a catagory of it's own. I would put it under a glass box in the Hall of Fame for the Hall of Fame. SO yea, would reccomend...but not for DayZ because it is dead now.
