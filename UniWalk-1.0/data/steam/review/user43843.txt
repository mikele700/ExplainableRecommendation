Engaging,surprising and what every shooter should be.
I had an enemy I needed to off, but make it look like a suicide. I bought him Bad Rats. Happy with my purchase.
This is my favourite RPG so far, I have not spent enough hours in this game. 10/10
Very well prsented and chilling the metro is a wonderful setting and is full of secrets and loot. Gun play is very balenced and tuned. The levals  are punishing is a good way. The AI is reactive, and the story is inticing and interesting i HIGHLY reccomend this game.
I am dead inside...
Every thing I wanted and more! Even with some of the fiddliest flaws this is obviously a great game 9.5/10. (Its still in alpha)That WAS my review when i first got the game, nvm lol its a blot on my inventory and should not be played by anyone until its finished.
