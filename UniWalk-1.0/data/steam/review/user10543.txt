Although I suck at this game, I had great gun and still have great fun playing it. The soundtrack is to die for and the skateboarding itself handles perfectly. To me, if any game can make me want to continue playing even though I keep failing than that game is doing something right. OlliOlli does everything right. I would recommend using a controller though and putting on your game face, as I think commentating and using a keyboard may have helped me fail. May :P
