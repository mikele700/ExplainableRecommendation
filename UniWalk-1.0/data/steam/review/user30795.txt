Be nice if the game actually launched properly...
Its a good game, the driving can be a sloppy and i hate how you have to spend your money on gas for the police car which is stupid, but other than that is pretty good
If you don't have it, than you should probably reconsider why you got into PC Gaming...
Its a fun game but i don't like the points system in the game, kind of takes the fun out of it being a classic hitman game
Can't stop playing it, so addiciting :)
Great game but UPLAY is so annoying
Good game, very realstic but its a bit pricey for what it is, i understand the realsm and the time its gone into making this game but it is very expensive, i would advise maybe dropping $10 off of the game make all addons no more than $10
Love it! really really good!
It's okay.............
Great game 9/10
