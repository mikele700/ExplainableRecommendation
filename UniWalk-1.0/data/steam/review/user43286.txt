If you have never played CS:GO, don't start. Worst community and no-life smurfs EVERYWHERE, forced to play a ton of games with them til you hit rank 3 (rank 3 takes a long time to hit). Then you can play competitive which is filled with people that just derank to kill new people for fun. Had about 1-2 hours of fun through the 40 hours I have played, honestly not worth the money and don't even get me started on the money scamming skin system.
Don't bother wasting your time with this game, once you hit a level 30 it becomes a painful losing streak until you quit. The matchmaking in this game is the worst, matches low tier players with high tier players and does the complete opposite of balancing the teams. Unless you are willing to throw down over $50 and get real lucky on the gambling stay away from this game.
