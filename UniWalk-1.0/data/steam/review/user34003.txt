Was trapped inbetween 2 rocks. Ate my own feces to die.10/10 would eat my own feces again.On a serious note, I have 150+ hours on this game, and I can tell you I enjoyed every minute of it. Be it running from a giant bloodthirsty Rex, or peacfully picking berries, ths game is definetly worth checking out. The core gameplay isnt repetative and you are always finding new things. The online community can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at times, but when you are on your own server with a group of people you know, the sense of community and togetherness becomes awesome. The base building is smooth, the taming is a fresh feature to survival games, and the core pvp is actually very fun. The graphics are very nice, but require medium to high tier computers to run anything but low, and it can still be laggy becasue of all the entities present, but it is pretty smooth otherwise. Once you set up a tribe and actually get going on a server, with people to help you out, the game becomes a lot less grindy and you can get to all the awesome base building and ♥♥♥♥. But for starter players, I recommend going a few hours on singleplayer just to get the core mechanics of the game, then going on to multiplayer, as the game is very unforgiving (R.I.P Pancake ;-;).Overall an amazing game that I am going to be spending a lot of my time on 10/10
This game is a game you want if you enjoy a nice little game that can be played to pass the time, and just to have a bit of fun on. I've spent acouple hours on this game, and I have had my fair share of laughs. If you are looking for a game that you will spenidng 100+ hours on, this is definetly not the correct game for you. there is still not a lot of content, and I'm not sure how much the devs update it. Overall this is a fun little game to pass the time, and you should probably only buy it when it goes on discount6/10
