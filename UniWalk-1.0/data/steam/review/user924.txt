This is one of the best games that i have ever played my entire life, this game will take you on an adventure into space with the help of the lotus and your friends and people you will come across this game will be the next goty for pc users all around who love space and ninjas. Now im a pretty big gamer on warframe and have gotten pretty far within on getting warframes and weapons but when an update comes out you just better get on and see what is new for what you will get and even with this one it is just amazing with the new frame and the weapons that have been added into it. And also that not just weapons and a frame but also a new ship as well which is an improvement to having a new kind of ship which you will need to find the parts and buy the blueprint in the shop and once your done making it, you have yourself a new ship. This game will make you wanting to keep on playing and not stop so go ahead and grab this game and play it for yourself and have fun tenno, we are all counting on all of you
i just have three words for this and it is funniest game ever
this is really one of the most best games i have played in my time of gameing
this is the most awsomest game i have played because you can use a variety of different kinds of dragons and weild a weapon of choise the first three dragons you keep after you complete the tutorial but the ones that are free they change all the time to a different one it also happens to weapons as well but it is a good way to experience new ways of using your dragon and weapon for speacial combinations
Ok I just have to say this, I have once liked TF2 but after some time of playing this game i have slowly started to hate this game so much, reasons why you might want to ask me is that i have not really liked the admins of certain cervers (mainly the two pony cervers im on and some others as well) with getting new ones and getting rid of once good ones who i have actually liked. This game is also used for the shop which is used for the keys to unlock these crates that are usually what you might get over a nice weapon or a rare chance of a simple hat. But honestly do people really want to spend over 30 or maybe 60 but not even exactly 100 dollars on some stupid ♥♥♥ ring that no one will ever buy for unless they really wanted to spend it on that damn thing, I say no you can get anything you wanted thats not some cosmetic item for your classes to all wear but i say that these items that i have seen and the new things that have even appeared in this game are just useless, all you get are some weapons or the main thing of hats which i have seen over the time that i have played this damn game. But unlike other games i have seen or played such as CS:GO also do the same thing with the shopping mechanism of the keys and crates for weapons. But as for TF2 I would say that i wouldn-'t even dare to touch or play this game even if they have made some good buffs but after that gunn metel update it just made it all go away for me and started to not even play it one single bit. Now if anyone would give me a single reason as to why i should play this game and i mean a good one not that -its so fun and amazing and that you can play with friend- just like any other game i have and that one of my friends have to play on i want a really good reason that you can easily persuade me to start this game up again once more and to prove that it will be worth my while then i will be playing it but otherwise i am not playing it worth anything even if i were to get an unusual which would cost me something or if anyone gave it to me for free. It-'s not happening and it is final
This has got to be the most best game and series of the red faction games and i have played the first and second red faction then after completing them and armagedon and started playing this and getting through most of the game i have just loved the entire series and I just know that anyone else who plays the games will love them as well.
