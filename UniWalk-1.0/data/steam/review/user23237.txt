Got Game on free trial at 9pm... My friend and i stayed up till 2:30am, only playing this game.
Loved the game, if you are reading the reccomendations to decide if you want it then GET IT! Even a person with no previuos knowledge of computer's or hacking can pla though it may take more time to understand what's going on but once you do its easy from there. But ther game has story, music, theme (backgrounds), jokes, factions, puzzles - sometimes I even had to look up a walkthrough so its not all that easy and it really feels like your hacking rather than playing a game. So many surprises that you wouldn't expect happen and the challenges are immensly satisfying when completed.PortHack/Bit
Got the game for $1.24 and i still feel like I've wasted money. The game is boring and very repetitive but the main problem is ur basically watching it. Its like a tv series where u can't do anything. I made a couple extra rooms and when the nest day came they all disapearred and everything that I was supposed to make had been rearranged. Don't buy unless uv'e seen someone play it and tried it, and now want it.
Needs campaign so bad. Especially to start you off cause I had no idea what to do for the first hour, basically what I did was lose all the spaceships I had at the dock. A campaign would also make the game more enjoyable.
Awesome Game!!!
Awesome game. Challenging at times but still fun
