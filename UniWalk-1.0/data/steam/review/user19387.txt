Do not bother until a patch is released. The games performance is sketchy at best, if you are running anything but the highest end hardware.
Awesome game and one of my favourite indie games (if you can call it that) on steam. The graphics, and art style are gorgeous, the production levels are all top notch, its hard to call this game indie. Solid, thrilling gameplay. Some may say it is repetitive, however i think its mixed up enough to keep things fresh and fun. Although it is the weakest part of the game the platforming still holds up and is enjoyable. I enjoyed fighting and running from zombies more then the -prince of persia- like puzzle sections, but even in the less exciting sections of the game the high detail of the world and excellent music make  travesring this 2d zombie apocalypse always exciting.DeadLight is only about 3-5 hours long so it can be finished it one sitting. It has a good amount of secrets and challenges to satisfy the completionist and provide you with ample replayability.-Worth purchasing even at full price -Controller recommened-4/5
Shoot guns from behind cover, or shoot guns in slow motion while you fly through the air. All that matters is shooting guns is fun in Max Payne 3 and you will be shooting a lot. Top notch graphics, motion capture animation makes great immersion and voice acting. Story is as good as it gets when it comes to video games
