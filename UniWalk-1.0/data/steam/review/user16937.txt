the best simulation game i've ever played! great graphics,customization,gameplay and map... AND its still in alpha.watch out for rotten kiwi's though     10/10    better than rust..........
One of the most under-rated games i have ever played,It by far has the best action out of most games, 9/10
What.The.♥♥♥♥
This game... i've only played 2 hours of it and it seems really good.....I would recommend this to anyone
from 1.5 hours of playing the game i think i can somewhat get an idea of how awesome this game wil be.initially it is very annoying to start (like any adventure/survival game) but you get used to it soon enough. the visuals are lacking but the gameplay makes you forget about graphics completely. overall: it's a great game to play and i really can't wait to see how far it comes. i really do reccomend this.
One of the single greatest Music based games ever made!
