REALLY ADDICTIVE and stole my money  11/10
The most infuriating I've ever played....
A potato can run better games than this
This game requires a high end pc but for some reason my high end Alienware Area 51 has lag and needs to be put on medium texture wiich is really a pain because i purcashed this computer to see the graphics and effect come to life not look like a game made in 2000 so i reccommed people who have a very good computer get this rather this is a very good game with a cliche story but with a good use of dead island/mirriors edge so my final verdict is a 7/10
Was GN3 now i am S4 Thanks all that hard work and dedication it took me a year to rank up to GN3 and now because of this ♥♥♥♥ing update i am now S4 thanks gaben anyway if you want to play this game be carful you might wanna rip your hair out because of the amount of (12 year olds racist,hacker,smurfers,derankers)oh and that hard earned rank you got before the update well good job trying to not lose it beacause if you even lose 1 game you will get deranked like i did(UPDATE: I ripped so much hair out of my hair because of this update i now look like a cancer patient)(UPDATE 2: I am now silver 4 and i have been hacked and my knife is gone i quit this)
