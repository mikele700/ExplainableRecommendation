purchased the defender's pack when it was on sale i think never knowing that i can get this game for free (without those bonus from the packs) and now, i want to upgrade it to the collectors pack once it is on sale because i barely have any money but if i do, i would buy it in full price.at first i got bored (i think it was june) but now i play this everyday for at least 2-3 hours (sometimes 6-8 hrs if i dont check the time)since the ascension patch came, the game got pretty excited because they added attack stance/type and since i'm pretty much a solo player it became easier for me to run a whole map without much trouble
casual game is more fun than competitive especially since there are people who cheats in CSGO to get rank
im from SEA and can play with any server worldwide without any lags (unless receiving delayed damage is one of them)normally multiplayer games in steam are only recommended for NA and EU players since people there buy it legally but here in SEA rarely people buy it so you also rarely get friends to play with.bought this on sale and i wished i purchased the GOTY one but fell $5 short (can only buy the base game that was on discount)if there's a sale this month for this game, i will sell all my items to buy it. for now i can just buy the gage courier pack since people heavily recommends it
CURRENT REVIEW - NEGATIVEmy new review is based on trade feature behind a paywall. crafting class like alchemist and pardoner are useless because even with token, you can only trade for 30 times a month or simply you are paying $0.6 to make 1 trade.unless they change the trading features, im gonna put this on negative review.Tree of Savior became MMORPG Simulator. a Single Player MMORPG that simulates cash grab or paywalls and selfish players like kill stealing and trash talking players.PREVIOUS REVIEW - POSITIVEplayed this, got auto attack delays (1 sec stuck on AA animation) but skills are ok not much delaylove the soundtracks, artworks and the gameplay itself although i keep on making new characters during the beta (finding a good build) i never got bored unless i really f*k up and messed with my characterTL;DR? - the best if you have low ping. good with 200-300ms. not good for 301-450ms. the worst for 451ms+To people putting a negative review based on the release date showing march 19 2016please do note that it is publicly released on steam this day so that people can pre-load it. other people can download it in a matter of minutes while others may take several hours (like i do 1gb = 1hr wait). be glad that we get to have an early access on march 29 and official release (f2p) after a month than the previous one which is june 2016 which is longer.
played this since it was called Dragonica. really addicting mostly if you have friends to play with.You can do the normal dungeon instance or when you reach a specific level you can now also do Tower Defense Mode or even a raid type instance where it is possible to 1 hit you.I recommend reaching lv 20 or advancing to 1st job before reaching 1 day after character is created for the achievement.and also keep your lv 1 weapon as it is needed to get 10,000 combo with no problem (mostly you can get it around 25-28 as an archer and cleric and around 30+ for assassin, no clue on warrior/swordsman since you can just spam attack until 10k combo)
this was when i played it last year i thinkfirst 5 hrs to the game i ran into 2 heavily armed dudes chasing me with their shotgun and pistolsi hid in my house and they voice chat me like they are mugging me.im from SEA so their voice is kinda scary but at the same time exciting because its the first time i hear a foreign person (in the US or EU) try to gang up on me and try to kill me while i hide.good thing they didn't destroy my house.this was revoke to me because the guy i traded to was using a fraud CCso yeah enjoyed it for a few hours and got my items that i used in trading at the end of the week.that time i would rate it 7/10
