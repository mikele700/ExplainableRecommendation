fantastic game has gotta be one of the best fps games on steam despite having a competitive community filled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. the only other bad thing is the gambling addicition you can find skins for free or you get crates which cost to open. the skin from the crate can range any where from a 10 cent skin that you payed 2.50 for or a $20 skin all skins can be sold except the defualts. but still a fantastic game 10/10
