I loved this game, I even bought it for a friend. I started it, the menu was glorious, I clicked play and started immediately. A few seconds in and I start feeling light, all the way through my torso and head. Moments later I start to feel a bit dizzy, still, I continued on and enjoyed playing the game. an hour later i started feeling pain in my left lung. I should have listened, I should of payed attention to the reviews, for now I fear that soon a may die.Do yourself a favorDon't play Bad Ratsyou'll ♥♥♥♥ yourself#CheckYourselfBeforeYouWreckYourselfCancer counsel hotline Australia: 13 11 20

0/10 Cannot recommendThe game is great but there are to many whiny defects leaving random negative reviews and complaining about DLC.I repeat  DO NOT  buy this game if you enjoy a lack of content and not having fun. Sorry but there is just to much to enjoy to recommend it. Not to mention the constant regular updates and bug fixes, really it's just terrible that these people are actually DOING stuff to improve the game. A real shame indeed.In all seriousness ARK has plenty to offer to those who don't cry when they lose dirt in Minecraft. I may not have a great number of hours in it but I fully intend to spend the next few years remedying that.Spoiler! This game is awesome and is well worth the money.
