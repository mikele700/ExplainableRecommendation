Oddly for me the appeal of this game is that I can play it solo after a day at work and just slowly work my way through levels. L4D did the same thing but I love the melee combat in this one. Definitely more fun and fast paced with friends, so I guess I'm a bit different.
I think this is my first review - but I couldn't let this game's metascore disuage people from playing this game.  Didn't play it originally when it got its horrible reviews, so keep in mind I have nothing to compare it to.The game is a fantastic blend of base defense + FPS with RPG elements.  There is progression both in each game via unlockable weapons and perks, and permanent progression in the form of 50 persistent levels and upgrades for each class.I haven't come across any bugs.  This is a super fun coop title.Buy a four pack!
