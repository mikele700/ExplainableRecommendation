The game that reduced me to madness where all I could focus on was Boris TodbringerYou may ask who is Boris well he is the leader of Middenland and I chased him for countless numbers of turns where he pillaged and raided the true empire and its lands. Boris was fortunatly slain by Karl Franz where his mighty mount deathclaw came chrasing down on Boris killing the rebel leader instantly. 10/10 would kill Boris with griffon again
♥♥♥♥ing peice of ♥♥♥♥ for a game. #♥♥♥♥ing done. Gets Banned for another idots mistake and being kicked from to many matchs because of trolls. Valve get your ♥♥♥♥ togheter
Similar to your many other vehicle games with how you have your tech tree and factions. However a differnt concept added how you can bring mulitple vehicles to the battle. Rather than having one and then getting killed at the beginning by a BS round forcing you to leave match immediately in a fit of rage.Would give this game a solid 7/10.
