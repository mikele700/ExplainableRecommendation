This game is just plain addictive. It lives up to every expectation it promises you and even more. Within two days i had already racked up 11 hours.Pros-Great strategy.Teamwork really is needed.Realistic sounds.Makes you feel like you really are part of a firefight.Cons-Valve seems to be trying to scam money out of you all the time. Luckily its only for cosmetics.
Great game and idea BUT plz Patch this soon ubisoft
BEST GAME EVER
