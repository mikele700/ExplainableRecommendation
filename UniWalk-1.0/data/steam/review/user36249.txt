Totally Amazing Game. I loved it from start to end, Black Plague is seriously more scary than Overture (which had its moments) and action that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Although this game isn't as scary as 'Amnesia: The Dark Descent' it still made my heart race and made me jump a few times. If you have some spare money, or in the mood for a nice horror/thriller game. This is the one for you. Gameplay 8/10 Scare Factor 6.5/10 Story 7.5/10 Action 9/10 Overall 8/10 p.s. if you haven't finished Overture before playing... prepare for spoilers ;)
