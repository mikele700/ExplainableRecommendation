ill say one thing for this game on just how much i like it... im buying an oculus just to play this game in its full glory... i luvz it :D
My God...I LOVE THIS GAME, and this is created by one person, man i salute you, this game is amazing, i dont know how many times, i have to say it, play singleplayer, awesome, but it does have an end, multiplayer, infinty, this game has SOO much potential, i hope this game goes far, cos i love everything about it, the only complaint i have, is maybe add a way to get to a bigger land, with more guns, more vechicle, and add some objectives, you know some goal, so you have something to work twoards on the side along with surviving, because so far it does get a bit boring to the end, when you practically have a fort of a base, but otherwise, this game is worth every penny, i even got gold, to give the guy some more money to work on this game, good on ya
