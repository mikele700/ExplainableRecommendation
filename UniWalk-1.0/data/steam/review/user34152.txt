queue time seem to have been fixed for a few days, but they seem to be back, idk if its because of the recent popularity but it is quite annoying , once you get in the game however it is a ton of fun
Amazing game, if you like westerns and counter strike you will love this, great game for a bit of fun 8/10 cant wait till they add the rest of the game in.
