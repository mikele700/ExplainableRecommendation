Its a good game but everyone pretty much just shoots you on the spot :Lsort of ruins the game wish i could like atleast build a base before been killed
One of my all time favourite games in the Total War series a complete master piece! you can do basically everything on the campaign map and the campaign features are absouletly crazy! i like the Prussian army and the whole game is just amazing 9/10
