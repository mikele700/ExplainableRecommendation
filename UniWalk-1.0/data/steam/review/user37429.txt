I like the game it is whacky and fun, But whenever i want to play matchmaking can never find me a game everand the challenges get very boring after a while.
I do like this game, BUT Something really needs to be done about the hackersgod mode and endless grenade throwing naked men, really kills the fun for others
Go rob stuff with your friends.
i don't know how, but this game has achieved Singleplayer LAG.
Love the game so far. It-'s just great, i-'ve been robbed twice and shot onsite for wandering into Cherno and uttering the word -friendly- My only complaint/Suggestion would be that you fix those Noclipping zombies ASAP. as it ruins a lot of play at the moment. Other wise im loving the game :D
