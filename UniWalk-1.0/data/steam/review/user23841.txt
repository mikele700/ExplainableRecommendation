The game... into reality is awesome!
Great Graphics even in low settingsCo-op Multi is very fun with friends (But i don't have friends to play with)Stealthable/attack/suprise anytime
So many things to do in the game itself. Has many fun gamemodes, but most servers are non-asia. Very popular in Youtube for gaming and animations.
Great FPS game which also contains sellable and purchaseable skins with steam wallet.Good Stuffs:Skins for gloryA lot of knife stylesInspect weapons In-game and during matchRanks for gloryLevels for gloryLogics:Switch to pistol is faster than reloadingMelee attacks is greater than millitary weaponsGrenades BouncesCrouching is mostly accurateNon-logic but possible and DOPE:Defusing with no handsLifting up hostages are faster with a defuse kitNo need to vault over objects just jumpNo echoes on soundsNoscopes snipers shoots randomlyFew weapons are useable for Run & GunFew weapons are 2 headshot kill without a helmet
The game is Addicting as **** . Even there's no Asia server, the least ping I have is 250-ish, But i manage to win and scored a goal. But pls, Asians need asia server
The series itself makes me into it. It makes me wanted to do it in real-life. lol JK ;)
