My favourite game of all time, an absolute steam essential, with a solid 12 hours of gameplay and an amazing story that will keep you hooked for the entire game. It is also a type of game that has you thinking after the credits have rolled. 10/10 Best $10 I have ever spent
A game that is bland and boring to play by yourself, but when you bring friends into the equation, it becomes a masterpiece full of hours of gameplay and many laughs. You wont be able to put this game down untill you have completed all 3 difficulties that you unlock by completing the previous. only real downside is the huge amount of dlc that will seem to rob you from all your money. 9/10 hyped for the next borderlands game
One of the few games that are on par with half-life 2, it has fantastic gameplay that combines both weapons and plasmids (superpowers) for fun and inventive gameplay. Walking through the ominous halls of the underwater dystopia known as rapture is one of the most memorable singleplayer expirences. 9/10 (would be 10/10 if it werent for the repetitive trivial hacking minigame)
This game is the bees knees.
A fun puzzle game that doesnt overstay its welcome, it takes only around 2 hours to complete the main game, which makes it good for speedruns which can add on to hours of gameplay. far superior to its sequel. 9.5/10
