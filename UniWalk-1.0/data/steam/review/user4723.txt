I had a bit of a propblem at first with opening the game because of my poor graphics card but once i got it working it is an amazing game and would highly recommend purchasing it. The game offers a wide improvement of fallout 3 and vegas with the combat system and enimies, but like every bethasda games it does have its bugs but oh well.
