So much better than Call of Duty Zombies anyday please give me MOARRR but thing is its buggy and when i first got it i had some few issues but solved thank to the internet!
Assassin's Creed Unity is breath takingRecently I have seen a lot of negative reviews and I highly understand the amount of trouble people are facing. As from my own game, I have not encountered one performance issue what so ever. Maybe slight ones but thats only been once or twice during intense parts. The game is visually amazing and the gameplay is so good it brings back good memories of the old Assasssin's Creed. The new parkour system is flawless and it just makes you want to play for days. I know this might not be the same for everyone, as I have seen a lot of glitches and the performance problems but for me I am running this game smoothly and the visuals are just so perfect.I would deffinitely recommend, but just be warned of performance problems. I myself havent enocoutered it so badly that it has made me want to unstall it.
A great game with sometimes the funniest games you will ever play. This game has a element of skill that is required but be warned it is not new gamer friendly. Give it some time and you will soon get the hang of it. Watch some helpful guides in the steam community as this will thorougly give you a run down on what to expect or to be expected of.
