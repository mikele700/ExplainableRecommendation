This is one of the best and hardest survival games i played,the gameplay is awesome but yet simple.I recommend this game to anyone who likes some challange.It is worth 18,99 € but it can't be finished because something will happen that will ruin everything that you worked hard for,but still its fun.My final sentence is 8/10
This game is awful!The developer is lazzy so he used the same blocks on more levels (it has few levels).I got a headache when i played it and it was mostly the same.The first level started ok but then i became very boring and anoying.I spent about 99 cents on it,worst decision in my life. And i don-'t get the price:The game cost 0,99 €But the package that has the game and the soundtrack (which is awful) cost 1,99 € , so that means that the soundtrack costs more than the game.But if you buy the game and -DLC- (soundtrack) buy separately then it costs the same,which is also dumb because the DLC and the game can-'t cost the same,its just dumbThe final score for this game by me is 1/10Go buy yourself Coca Cola instead of this game!
The game is fun and creative.You make your own ships and the physics are good.I think this is the best sandbox game on Steam.I love it because you can dig asteroids, build giant space stations, build giant ships,explore and destroy it all.You should buy this game.
The game is realy good and its just like then,you fight to win!You can buy yourself good armors,better weapons,but dont think if the weapon is 100 000 that doesn't mean its better than a weapon that costs 3000.So i reccomend this game to everyone who like medival fights.
