I have played 1000 wolves for days and i am amazed at how the game can roll up a 9,j,k on every spin no mistake every spin u get a 9 on first line j and a j k on 3rd line and no wilds and whe u get a wilds its always with a 9 j kit goes more than 100 spins in a row with nothing but 9s js ks and then u get a bonus round and guess what u get more 9s no wilds and thats all,and u can wait for hours for the bonus tyo come up again.ITS TIME THEY FIXED THE GAMES THEY ARE QUICK TO TAKE YOUR MONET BUT LEAVE U OUT TO DRY ONCE THEY HAVE THE MONEY
as you can see i have played for over 500 hours,and i think its a great gameleaves simcity for dead, bit it has its problems.in my humble opinion, it needs something to better manage its resourses, no matter how much industryi have in my city it always runs out of raw materials,but its still exporting materials,cant work that outit could have the same as simcity and allow you to use the recycle center to give resourses from the rubbishto feed industry.this is the only fault i have with the game.fjm1948
load of rubbish,why u cant use the game pad is beyond me
