it made me pogchamp pretty hard
this game is ♥♥♥♥ing incredible, worth the $50
game has turned to absolute bu7tt cancer, matchmaking has been ruined by smurfs and an unreliable mm system, would not play, save the money, don't be lured by the skins
10/10, game runs very smoothly and is great fun to play
Amazing
amazing game, spent countless hours nerding this beautiful game :)
