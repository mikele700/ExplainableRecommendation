Spintires is a fairly realistic offroad driving simulator where you have to navigate a handful of soviet vehcles through tons of mud, dense bush and rivers. This game is rather challenging because you get bogged all the time in the thick mud or you stall your vehicle in the water with no hopes of retrieving it.PROS:- Fun- Can be played for hours on end- Is realistic- controls are easy and customisable- Levels are huge- Casual and Hardcore gamemodes- Realistic fuel consumption (Hardcore mode)- Casual makes game easier for people who don`t want to have as much a challenge as if hardcore- Casual still challengingCONS:- Could have added a fully manual gearbox- Is a little buggy on start up, it sits with a blank screen and says oops, spintires has crashed- Could have more vehicles- Could have more levels- Devs said there would 70+ vehicles by the end of their dev but they haven`t done any work on the game since May.I do recommend this game to all as everyone would find something fun and interesting about this game.This is my first review so could I have some feedback
