Elegant If i have one word to describe Etherial Seina with its graceful the storytelling and simple charaters that are easy to get behind. Seeing the developing plot ensure the player to actually care about the these charaters and that saying a lot for a heartless person like me. Eternal Senia storng points is mostly story focused game where you get some heavy feels. Likewise the Gameplay is simple with simple RPG elements for that include crafting armour and weapons, magic and skills and basically what you expect form a RPG. I you were thinking that it is medicore RPG right well the reason to play this game is that its a short 3-4 hour game to complete (unless you want you finish the game having everything then 5-7 hours max) to experience Senia journey and hardships. By the way the OST is other reason why this game is overwhlemingly postive that you have to experience for yourself. There were negatives but you have to play it to have a opinon i.e, simple graphics however the developer is not an AAA game developer and grinding.To conclude, amazing story and charaters with a strong sense of development, OST is joy to learn to while play the game ,simple gameplay for anyone to pick up play and short . Ethernal Senia is a gleaming hidden gem within the darkness of free to play despite its problems I give Ethernal Senia a 9/10 PS: if it have better graphics or higher budget 11/10 
Basically if you enjoy the previous games (original CS and Counter Strike Source) you will definitely enjoy CSGO refined graphics and game play. If your new to FPS games or new to the CS franchise then GSGO would be or should be your pick I highly recommend this games to anyone who FPS games and CSGO probably be one of the best FPS Games out there in the gaming world therefore Yes and Buy it because it bloody amazing.
