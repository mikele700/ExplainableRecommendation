Remember Titan Quest? Grim Dawn is basically a more improved verison of it, so if you enjoyed Titan Quest, you should enjoy Grim Dawn.
From the creators of the show, comes the South Park games.In South Park: The Stick of Truth, you will experience everything that has happened in the show. If you like or enjoy the show, then the game is a must.
Horrible. Gameplay is rather sluggish, graphics arent too good, and the matchmaking just doesn't want to work like it should do.
Fun game. Think of the game as a more destructive GTA game. In Just Cause 2, there's a lot of things you can do, such as doing the missions (takeover strongholds, complete factions) or just free roam. There are also different collectables throughout the game. I would have to say that the game-play is good, but not great, and the graphics are pretty decent.
I do not recommened this game at all. The gameplay is really awful, and the servers are just laggy. To me, it feels like that the game isn't being supported by the developers.
