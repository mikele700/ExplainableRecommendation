Brilliant story, interesting characters and awesome character development. This game is great fun and has you guessing what's going to happen. also great beacause the story change depending on the decisions you make. Probably not worth the full $25 bucks, because there's only about 9 hours gameplay, but if you can get it for anything under 10 it's a steal.
AWESOME SAUCE BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥
Awesome game command army of medieval soldiers with up to 200 on the battlefield. Mods can push it further. Definitly worth the $10 on sale atm, a must buy.
