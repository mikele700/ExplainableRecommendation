Saw it on sale for cheap so not too much of a loss.Grabbing/holding parts doesn-'t consistantly work (60-70% fine), game decided at three different points to resize from -Fullscreen- to -Original- - whatever damn resolution original is...
Pros:* Tolkien universe* Interesting premise* Orcs fall into simple categories - Normal, Urak, Archers, Spear Throwers, Hoplites, Captains, WarchiefsCons:* Orcs are pertually respawning to the point where you feel you make no progress* You don't ever feel like you are making progress* If you ever do make progress, that is short lived and replaced with more orcs* All of the orcs seem to be chav's converted by the dark lord* I would have enjoyed watching this more as a movie than playing it as a game* It's essentially a re-skinned, re-mapped batman arkham city* Had to double check to see if ubisoft made it
I really enjoyed this game and found myself playing it literally for hours on end.All of the main concepts for a city builder are in the game and it all just...works. Didn't encounter any bugs, didn't find myself unable to sort out a problem/task in-game.The only fault I can find is that by 100,000 citizens, it starts to feel like a little bit of a grind but hey, at least by that time I was rolling in cash and could build anything I felt like.10/10
I-'ve completed close to 24 hours in the game now over two playthroughs of different races.Satellites are used in an Orbital Layer and give bonuses (so don-'t forget about them).The Affinities make it so that next to no-one else on the map likes you much.Energy = Money.AI gives you proposals that they reject when you accept.Trading Convoys/Vessels and setting up little routes for bonuses is cool.Trade routes seem to stop maybe 15-20 turns after being setup and there doesn-'t seem to be an option to have perpetual routes.About half way through a map both miasma and aliens stop being actually dangerous to you.Researching too much of the science tree seems to make the AI snarky about -losing your humanity-.Beyond that, seems to be bog standard Civ with some new skins, couple of map packs and some decent optimisation.Still as much of a time sink - 7/10
Game Dev Tycoon was an indie game I had heard about a little while ago, looked at the concept and left it alone - found it again during the latest Steam sales and bought it to have a bit of a play with.That little bit of a play with the game, turned into a marathon where I completed the game in a single, long playthrough and really enjoyed it, far, far more than I had expected - far more than I thought I would.The game is simple, yet more complex that a first glance, fun and engaging.Greenheart Games, thank you for putting this game out there, you have acheived far more than I expected from an indie release!
Kerbal Space Program is a great space simulation game (with Rocket building!), something I had always wanted to play but never found the game to do it in.Stock KSP can be fun, don't get me wrong but where this game shines is in it's huge range of mods available which can really enhance gameplay (Think Communication relays, building ships in space, more engines etc)
