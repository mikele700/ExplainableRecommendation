Feel OP as you smash through 500 bad guys while you try and figure out what to do for the mission
Something about mixing the match 3 of candy that i never liked, with Marvel has created a great game. While it may be wanting you to spend money, you do not have to. And trust me it gets better with the more heros, all the stratergy behind each move. Anyway, if you like match 3 games or mavel this is a great time waster
So much fun with others
