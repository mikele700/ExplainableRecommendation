Since the update of -Hotfix 8.1 Patch- 10/29/2015 around 6:00PM, the game started showing errors and malfunction. It says -Searching for session- and you will have to wait for 3mins then it will close like no ♥♥♥♥ has happened. This wasn-'t like this man! I don-'t like that... When you put the -REGION OPTION- it started to go wrong... Remove that fu**** option!!! >:(
