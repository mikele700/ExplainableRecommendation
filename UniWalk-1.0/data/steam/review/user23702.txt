I am scared of the night, in games like this especially. Wolves,boars,dragons and so on. Watched a youtuber trying out the game, gets motivated to buy it. Buys the game. Plays the game for 2 hours in Multiplayer. Raging because I died of cold. [All because I needed one more stone.] 15 minutes into finding my friend in the cold night. Its morning, builds a house. Lives in house. A strong man chases after me and my friend. We ran and hide in the forest. Staring at the man from behind a tree. He chases me. A wolf saves me by distracting the man. Escapes. Makes armour for friend and me, hunts the man down. Kills the man. Loots the man. Prosper in the game. Run out of wood. Its night time. Sees a boar. Hides in house cause I am -Shadow fearful-. I hide in the house till my friend comes in. He asks for food. We go hunting for food. Remembers about the boar. Refuses to go out. My friend goes out. I check my inventory, alot of items in the vinicity. Looks like my friend-'s items. Screams in horror. Opens door.What happens? That is for you to find out.This game looks very promising. Although it is in early stages, I already find it better than alot of games. Although the combat does need improvement [Bows bows bows bows] but the game is VERY REALISTIC [Opinion Alert]. However, it is very rage inducing as very few items are given to you at the start. The world is so big that finding your friend takes HOURS. [Is this a compliment to saying the map is huge?]. I try to imagine the future multiplayer. Sleath take-downs on players/creatures. Walls for defending, playing rent for living in people-'s houses :3. Archer towers where I hire people to be archers on night shift with their bows, placable torches. BOATS AND NEW ISLANDS [HOHOHO MAYBE NOT THIS MAP IS TOO HUGE FOR ME AT THE MOMENT XD] *Note:This is what I think ONLY.*Overall,This game, Is definitely a game you will want to buy
