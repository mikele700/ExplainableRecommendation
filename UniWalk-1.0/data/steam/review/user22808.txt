Have you ever secretly had a lust to be bummed in your sleep by a weeaboo who has way more time to invest in a video game then you? Well look no further. The amount of times you will be absolutely poo'd on by some 12 year old who's mum is an alcoholic and doesn't care about what time he stays up to as long as the little turd isn't in her hair, and then wake up the next morning on the beach in rust, after you just started to get your base off the ground is insane. Sometimes I consider uninstalling the game, but you sometimes get these temporary lapses of wanting to have fun. This is of couse ruined by the various collection of weeaboo's, neckbeards and no lifers of the like who invest way to much time in the video games then at school, work or other various necessities of society. The game is good, The fun is definitely had, but if someone spends more time on this game then you chances are you are screwed. Also the shooting mechanics are so sloppy, honestly the cheap cs-go recoil rip off  causes guns to miss most bullets/ not register and sometimes causes my stools to harden and therefore causes them trouble in dropping from the depths of my buttocks.  You have to buy this game basically, but you will have a very strong love hate relationship with it.  OH and play with friends otherwise the chances of you quitting are at least 90.00%
