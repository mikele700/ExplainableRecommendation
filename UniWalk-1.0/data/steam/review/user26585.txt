Awesome Fun game, heaps of hours of gameplay
Ok. Overall For the sale price $7.49 CS GO is a pretty good game. I dont like it that you cant scope in on most weapons and the spawns on deathmatch are so very frustrating.
Awesome Game, heaps of fun. Definately worth the money
One of the Best Free to play games out there. No question, This game is amazing
