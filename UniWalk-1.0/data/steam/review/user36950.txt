IF YOU ARE A NOSTALGIC FAN OF SAINT SEIYA READ THIS !PROS:-The combat system is fast and exciting it remainds the DBZ Budokai tenkaichi saga-Lots of characthers and costumes (new armors, training suites, etc)-It has the four main Sagas to play in story mode (Sanctuary/Asgard/Poseidon/Hades with Elyseos field)CONS:-The cinematics in the story mode are awful, they are almost just standing models with lip sync-Only one special ability has a cinematic in the fights, some charechters can have more than one cinematic ability but you have to choose only one to use in the match-Has a grafic Bug wich lags the game and desyncronize the voices (but is easy fixed with resolution changing, and a bit of code script)-The voices other than Japanese have no soulOverall is a great game, if you like fighting games and Saint Seiya you will enjoy it a lot
