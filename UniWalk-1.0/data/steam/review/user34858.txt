This game is the one of the only survival games i've played and actually its my first its a beatiful game i like the looks of it the controls and the scary your all alone feel to it when i saw videos of this game i was like i need to get this game so when the steam sale started i got 50 dollars to spend spent it on a few games and then still had enought to get this and i was with a friend looked at the game and was like i have enough money and then i said F*** it and bought it and i have no regrets there still are a few bugs and glitches and if i see any i'll send a report about it can't wait for the full relase of this game can't wait for it to be 10x more awesome then it already keep up the good work  and when i see a reaper levithan i vertiually ♥♥♥♥ myself and i lost a seamoth to one of them and if you were thinking you could train them to be a killing machine thing again they will swallow you whole and may even give you nightmares   12/10 would lose a semoth to a reaper and get eaten again
A very good game i like the concept the action and the scary feel of when a shark is coming the guns are good the game play is good 10/10 would get eaten by shark again
A great game and i love it to death like the original killing floor its greatly polished with some bugs/gitches here and there its a great game even with 2 new ZEDS, 1 new Boss, New Characters and Re-Made Characters and some new maps its still needs more but its ok for me how it is and i understand that the Devs are doing there best and trying hard to make more Characters maps and bring back/make new bosses because the game was only realesed in the end of April this Year its a Great game and i enjoyed it and will continue to Keep up the Good work TripWire   10/10 would be torn apart by Angry Flesh pound again 
Its a really good game but now i'm having problems and my game keeps crashing when i open any single player world i don't know if its a problem with the games or my addons or both but when its not like that its great 8.5/10
this is WAY PAST COOL
