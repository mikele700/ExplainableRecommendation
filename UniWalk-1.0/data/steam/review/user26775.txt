This game perfect for trolling pplayer cuz of little compy
This game is Not Recommended because this game same like Counter Strike : Global Offensive but the different it's Human vs Dinosaur, and you must buy ''key for crate''. And the Primal Carnage : Extinction, alot of item it's not tradeble/marketble. This game is weird to me, we can't trade even one item from new Primal carnage game. Item is tradeble only few. You waste your money for dino/human skin, weapon skin, and cosmetic, and Team Fortress 2 is betterbecause it's have unusual cosmetic but Primal Carnage :Extinction no have unusual just like uncommon,fog,etc. And you will shame your self your self because didn't get the Feather raptor skin, Feather raptor skin in new Primal Carnage is uncommon quality, and it's Ultra rare because, you only get when Old Primal Carnage Early Acces or Pre-order the feather raptor skin before you play it/ download it, if you want the feather skin, it's too late
