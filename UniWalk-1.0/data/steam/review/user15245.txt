A very different approach version of final fantasy compare to all the others, definitely worth a try if you like action-focus rpg game.
It's a fine, no, AWESOME reboot of the series. Definitely worth to try, and looking forward to the upcoming game.
Definitely recommend for the single player, it's GTA! While the online gameplay, the connection is not stable if you're not from the server region. So i would not recommend the online play if you're not from the west.
