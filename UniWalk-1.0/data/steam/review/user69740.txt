Team Fortress 2 is a fun action first-person shooter with a cartoon like style. It has a good variety of classes (My favourite is the spy) and has loads of cool items and weapons to unlock. It has lots of great maps and fun game modes from Man vs. Machine to capture to the flag. This is a game I totally recommened! ....Unless your 6, 6 year olds are too young to be playing violent games >:( In conclusion if you don't have steam money and you want a fun cartoonic shooter to play than this is perfect for you!
