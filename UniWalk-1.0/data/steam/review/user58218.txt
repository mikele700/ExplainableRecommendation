1 WORD EPIC
the game is realy good in the maps the aliens and the weapons people might say its just a rip off of aliens its not but if its a rip off then its a rip off done good it has realy challenging gameplay half of the time i was scared as hell when a horde of aliens comes it would be cool if they add a defence mode or a game where u play as the aliens like in l4d
To start things of the game is not perfect and its lying in the trailers yes the cover based,leaning and rolling is useless but its a mix of counter strikes graphics with call of duty ghost stuff but its definatly a good game the problem is that its too repetative and the last freakin 5 hours playing this just a complete laag fest and the cars suck BALLS when u start the round youll just bump each other while i get 90 frames per second and the cars is just crap all the cars are too fast unrealisticly and half the time youll see when you spectate that the chopper is just a neverending cycles of choppers even though you shot one chopper down itll respawn thats too unfair plus the defuse maps are so ♥♥♥♥in small smaller than cods and the dogs are dumb ♥♥♥ hell! the grappling system just looks like crap and why would we use it anyway but the team deathmatch is beautiful its perfect even though its just a ripoff of:battlefield,call of duty and counter strike but the maps need to be fixed and for some reason theres only 1 sniper in the whole game and also added fire extinguishers but they put it in maps dosent have fire yay for uselessness but its still good game so all in all its a six over ten
