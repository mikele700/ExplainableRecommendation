Portal 1 was a good game until the third playthrough i did: The most creepy and freaky things started happening, it was as scary stuff. It's fun but don't play it three times unless you want a scare
Space Engineers was a good game except for the lag, but apart from that it's a good game based in spaceeeeeeeeeeee!with mining, defence and possibly spaceeeeee pirates.
i quite liked this game and was not at all suprized to see the massive quantity of good reviews this game has had. Valve could even possibly make a third portal game! good work Valve!
