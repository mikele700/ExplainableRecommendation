This game made me realise the beneficial conquest of social interactions to have in collaboration with others while interaction in electronic entertainment. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡ -)
Great game, too many people mistake it for a grindfest, but they just dont know how to play the game.
r8 this game 9/11, needs more bombs.
This game is great, if you like to just stare at Kali's animations that is. Especially in PvP ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Great game, terrible servers and bad hackers
