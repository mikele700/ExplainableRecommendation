2/10I wanted to play some counterstrike until I was faced with a levelling system in order to play competitively. The ranks are worth nothing more than to say -Ive played longer than you- which still isnt any indication of skill. When will ranks be about actual skill level and less about total play time? Then theres the weapon skin franchise, which is basically encouraging kids to gamble which is quite sad. The amount of money you can sink into silly gun paint is ridiculous. I spent less than 5 bucks on about 10 different weapon skins with Stat-trak, instead of paying $2.50 for potential crap, so why bother buying keys and cases at all? If you want the excitement of gambling without actually wasting money, go watch the people who do 100 cases at a time on Youtube.
