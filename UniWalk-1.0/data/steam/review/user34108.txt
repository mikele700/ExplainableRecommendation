Even in games I'm meant to be forever alone :/10/10
This game is a masterpiece.
After hours of creating my very own prison, a fire starts in the kitchen.I got so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ i initiated a lockdown trapping 85 staff, 50 prisoners and at least 5 visitors.Now i am facing ten years for criminal negligence.10yrs/10 would do that again
Although i havent finished it just yet i can say that this game is one of the best free rpgs ive played.Good plot, Story rich and a nice and simple gameplay.It's also free so yeah no ragrets!
At first i was like-Im not gonna buy sets or items its waste-But then-Hmm that looks nice oh and that too- i honestly cant stop getting them now.
This game is straight up awesome! Gameplay is fun, Extremely likable characters and the story is full on amazing!Not to mention a variety of waifu choices!
