Wanna hear a joke? This game. When this game came out around a year ago, I was so excited for a new zombie survival experience. After playing it for a few hours, I found myself still running around the map looking for my friends. I decided I had enough and logged off. The follwing day, I spent countless hours attempting to build a base and find some useful gear. It came to my realisation that the game was ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. I closed the game without hesitation and never touched it again.Now, several months later I have decided to give Sony Online Entertainment, or Daybreak of whovever the ♥♥♥♥ they are one more chance, but looks like they have made almost zero progress on this game since I last played, except adding some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ micro transcations (cases: are you ♥♥♥♥ing joking)I can name several reasons why this game is a bloody joke without even having to think about it. Firstly, the world is half ♥♥♥♥♥ and the same structures are regurgitated over and over. It just looks like a complete ♥♥♥♥ing mess. Secondly, scavenging is so unrewarding. You will search a whole ♥♥♥♥ing neighbourhood of houses that look exactly the same and find ♥♥♥♥ all. Thirdly, the devs frankly don't give a ♥♥♥♥ and it just seems like they can't be bothered with this dead end game. The only thing that I can say is half decent about this game is the battle royale, but its certainly not enough to keep me interested in playing this game.To conclude, H1Z1 is a huge ♥♥♥♥-up. The devs are uncommitted and I can honestly see no real potential in its current state, so you might aswell save your 20 dollars and spend it elsewhere.
