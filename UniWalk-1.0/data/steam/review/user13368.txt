Infectonator : Survivors , Small Review by Santo98I would just like to start with this game being within Alpha and I can not go full blown with this.Pros:- The Music gets you pump'd- The Scavange System is nice- Movement system is nice, you can either click and drag or just click- For being in Alpha, there is a nice amount of weapons.Cons:- After Completing a Mission, you are only greeted by a sentence saying you've made it, at least something visual- The price of healing, I think it could be lowered to atleast 30 or 35 coins, 50 coins is quite a lot- Your ability to reload, automatic reloading between waves would be niceOverall though, I'm enjoying this game so far and hope the best for it and all of it's future updates, being a fan of the series.
Like a WB cartoon. Except you get to shoot them in the head.
This game is not the best for it's kind, the older ones I enjoyed a lot more. If your willing to try this I would suggest not to and just go straight on the next game.
I think this game is made for the people who want a challenge but don't back down from it. It contains action, Blood! and all of the things you'd want to see!
Doesn't work in Australia, Australians DO NOT BUY!
This is just one of those really good FPS with the ability to fly while killed crap trying to kill you :D
This game is really awesome and worth the money :D.
This game is GROOVY!
