WOW what a game. I brought this game on sale and feel like I ripped off the developer. I have not played a great single player game in a while that I have not wanted to stop playing after a few hours. Such a great story line will keep you wanting more and it will immerse you into the world with a sympathetic connection to the characters. If this game had really high end graphics I don't think it would be as enjoyable as the simple yet beautiful art style that this has. Once you max out your Blink and Agility runes with the addition of Swift Shadow and Fleet Fighter bone charms moving around the roof tops at speed and blinking between ledges is such a great feeling. I highly recommend this game to anybody, easily worth the money. Developers really need to make more games like this 10/10.
Grab a box of tissues because this one will hit you right in the feels. One of the best story's in a game ever, this needs to be made into a movie. It will make the manliest of men shed a tear 10/10
