The game starts out fun and then just becomes a timesink.  Once the world gets to a certain age its all about the -Pay To Win- and if you want to not die, then you better be playing (and buying) 10+ cards a day.Would totaly recomend you bash your head on your desk for just as much enjoyment.
This game looked very promising and I had my hopes up that it would get to the point of being a true 4x strat game.  Well it never got there, it looks nice but the gameplay is totally bland and has nothing unique about it.  It portrays itself as -epic, complex, and dense- but I would have to say its 100% the opposite; mediocre, simple and  shallow.  On a positive note, if you have children that are under 10 and you are trying to teach them about 4x strategy, this game is a very good training game for them...if it can hold there attention.
This game gave me aids.
A bad game in all ways.
The people that ported this game onto the PC should be shot in the dark. Totaly unplayable, 1/10 (only because it had a decent opening).
