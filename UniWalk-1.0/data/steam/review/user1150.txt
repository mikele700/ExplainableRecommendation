Rogue Legacy is a really fast-paced challenging but fun game to play whether you're a casual gamer or an addict.So you go to the castle... and die. Then you get to take a pick of three heirs to continue your legacy. You choose a near-sighted dyslexic mage. He dies. Then you choose i gigantic gay paladin who then goes to the castle. He dies. Then his colorblind   dwarf daughter goes to the castle. She dies too! After many many generations of odd-traited heirs, your great-great-...-great-grandson who has vertige and is scared of chickens beats the first boss. It makes you feel AMAZING.After experiencing about 47 generations of heirs i got the hang of the game. You will too.This game is really different from other games on steam. It is a twisted version of a rogue/castlevania game, and the nostalgia will hit you when playing this.I DEFINITELY reccomend spending the $5 to buy this game!!!    9.5/10
ORION: Dino Horde is by far my favourite MMO to date. I think the idea to the creation of the game was to just put every cool thing about every online multiplayer game and just mix it into a wibbly wobbly ball of awesomeness. a MUST get!!!
