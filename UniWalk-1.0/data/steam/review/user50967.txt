You came for the freestyle spell-casting, you stay for Vlad
Interesting story. Not the most challenging thing I've ever played but it's suppose to be that way. Nice progression.But most importantly, the graphics are just GORGEOUS! This game is absolutely beautiful.Besides a few bugs with movement and walls, there are no faults at all.
The amount of customisation avaliable in this game is CRAZY! Everything is customisable to your play style from skill tree to abilities. Gem combinations can create some really unique ability, combine that with your unique skill tree with insane abilities that let you go for whatever bonuses you like. 10/10
Very realistic simulation, perfect for people seeking a casual yet challenging game.
Intense action-packed RPG, its totally epic
