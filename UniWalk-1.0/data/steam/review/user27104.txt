Garry's Mod is but a tool of your imagaination. Hours of design, creating and destroying all in the name of fun and laughter. The only limits you hvae are what you can imagine (that is especially true for when you hide as a prop hahaha)Very reconmended for the new gamers, as well as a staple fo the old.
