i really enjoy this game its ♥♥♥♥ing dope and it deserves the views its got
okay so this game... its okay but if you like graphics dont get itdont play this by your self it can get realy boring but with friends its fun i just wish some of the game mode were easier if played with less people some were unplayble because the enemy team were that op (im refering to some of the zombie modes) the ai are alright but some game modes there stupid we played zombie ai or bots (cant remember what its called) and they didnt see us for the hole timefor my full rating i would say a 6 it wasnt bad but wasnt that good.
