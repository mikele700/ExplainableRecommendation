Ok I'll give it to you straight, This is a very short game around, one weekend you can finish the campaign! But this really is not a factor in this RTS, This game represents how good RTS games can be by providing you some of the best multiplayer ever seen with you having MOBA fights or massive land battles with you and a friend. The Graphics are far more superior than DOW one and has much better strategy but BEWARE, If you want a 1000 v 1000 battle your dreaming. I am speaking harshly about this game, but only because its so good to play and deserves to be in every one's steam View list as a Favourite or Favorite, if your American. One of the best RTS games is here! Although this is a bit dear, you get what you pay for. $40. May the Ork blood be forever on your chainsaw!
This game is a Key to a unlocked door. This is war of the roses and i have played this game for a week now and it is one or the MMO's i have ever played with hardly no lag and skillfull yet suttle combat. This is a must have, to anyone and everyone you must get this game, it's a allrounder with stylish graphics vast landscapes and custom heroes!!! :) 9/10
