Take League Of Legends give it a cartoon look and bam you have awesomenauts, it is one of those games that is competitive while also being a  time waster, I love the quick games in comparison to league of legends, This game has multiple characters which makes it fun to play and also gives you something to aim for as you level up, each character having its own special abilties  and if you learn how to use the characters well enough you can pull off some crazy combos and deal a hell amount of damage.This game is definatley worth buying because you will never get bored has endless amounts of play time and also the fact that you take those skils and incoporate them with your team and you have a recipe for success
