Have you ever shoot while gliding? or have you ever shoot in slow motion??? if both are no then this game is the best to do it all
This game is really fun at first i ignored it and thought it was a bad game now that I have played it, it really is a fun i really recommend trying it out
Really fun only problem is money and most especially is less players
i like the diffrent mods of this game well of course that's why they call it Gmod ~(=3=)~
Duh...
