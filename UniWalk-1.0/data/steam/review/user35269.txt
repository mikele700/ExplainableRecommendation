This game is fun. Plot and characters irritate me, but mechanics and fighting is fun. My computer struggles to run it, so I suffer from constant slowdown. However, it slows down in a way that it often makes me feel it overloaded on dramatic effect. It makes my casts and attacks come out slower, but it's a smooth slow, so everything feels a lot more potent and impactful than I'm sure it is.
Short game, not a fan of the aesthetic of demonic blugh. The feeling of being pushed around never set well with me in a game, especially in ones that I can-'t properly vent that frustration on the oppressor.Fun story, this was gifted to me, and at some point, I got frustrated with the aesthetic and uninstalled. Friend got sad, so I reinstalled and completed it. To finish the story is spoiler, but it made me cringe after the aforementioned series of events. I-'m sure there-'s a video up somewhere if you really want spoilers, I just know that every time I see spoiler blackouts, I can-'t ignore it and have to look at it.As far as bugs go, I can-'t say I ran into any. If anyone wants to spend $5 for 1-2 hours of -fun,- I-'m not stopping anyone.
