Shot cameras, ran out of ammo, killed cops, revived friends, died (countless times)10/10.
Game looks amazing, very smooth and the combat is fluid and fast.However, I was stopped at mission 3.Mission ♥♥♥♥ing 3.Because of some bug that causes not just me, but hundreds of other people to be unable to progress any further than the start of mission 3. You approach Alisa, talk to her, walk out the door and put a phone to your ear. Surprise, the hoe from earlier.She talks for about 20 seconds and then you stand there, holding an invisible phone to your ear.The door should've closed, but has not.Great ♥♥♥♥ing work here.Amazing.11/10unplayable.
