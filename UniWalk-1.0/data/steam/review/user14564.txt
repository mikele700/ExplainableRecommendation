Buy this game and you wont have to go out and go to parties anymore because this game has more flashing lights than if you bought 3,000 Disco Balls. 101/10 IGN. But on a serious note this game is one of the most unique games out there and if you wanna have a good time playing with balls (haha) then buy this game.
