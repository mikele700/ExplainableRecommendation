50 dollars i will never get back from this ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal excuse for a game. honestly i've gotten games for less than a dollar that were better made more enjoyable games than this. please i beg you all avoid this like the plague.
this game is short, very short, short enough to finish the story in an afternoon/ evening. but it is very fun doing so, and the story and narration are amazing. it even got a wee bit emotional towards the end and the Narrator always kept the story and action moving along, in some ways it had some strong similarities to call of Juarez : gunslinger in the narration style, with it responding to players deaths and weapon usage as well as interaction with the surroundings.  it's a gorgeous looking game as well and frankly i think anyone who is looking for an easy to pick up isometric rpg should seriously consider this one :) all in all a cute, fun, humouress and well written little game
it's just good wholesome family entertainment. seriously though it's a lotta fun and i highly recommend you get into it.
kind of very dreadful. the story is unispired and tedius. the gameplay is awful and it really just doesn't feel good to play
♥♥♥♥ son y'all need to get in here and play this. its pretty ♥♥♥♥ing excellent
