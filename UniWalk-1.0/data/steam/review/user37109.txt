Recently, I purchased EDGE during the Steam Holiday/Christmas sale for $0.99! And let me tell you, that is the best dollar I have ever spent. The game requires strategy and can be very challening to the mind. Overall the music makes the player feel relaxed, giving a very laid back feeling. If you just want to play a simple plotted game (playing as a cube, collecting cubes whilst solving puzzles) that provides fun and has charm, or you want something that is fun yet challenging as the game progresses, then this is for you. Frame rate does not seem to be a problem and runs very smoothly.10/10
