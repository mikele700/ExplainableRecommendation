It's fun,Non-Rage inducing. The music is acually good and unlike some other point&click MMO's It has flower picking.I don't usually play MMO's but i will play this one (And WOW,LOL). It is not Laggy but in some cases you might lose connection but this is ALPHA/BETA Love it thats all i'm going to say
