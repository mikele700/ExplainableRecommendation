*SPOILER ALERT m8's*Far Cry 3 is more of an experience than a game, one second you're partying on an island everything is smooth, next second you an your friends decide to go 'skydiving' on another 'remote' island, not so bad? But when you hit the ground you are ♥♥♥♥ed, this insane pirate called 'Vaas' ambushes and captures you and your friends who then plans to sell you into slavery. You wake up, tied up next to your older brother 'Grant' locked up in a bamboo cage, and to the right of you is Vaas, he then starts giving you a lecture about all this crazy ♥♥♥♥, your brother Grant (who served many years in the military), manages to get loose of the rope, unties you and calls a guard over to the cage, he then knocks out the guard, takes his key and opens the cage. You then have to slowly sneak past the guards in the compound until you reach the exit, unfortunately as you are escaping your brother is shot in the neck by Vaas, he then gives you the oppurtunity the run out of the compound while he and his guards are shooting at you, you run while bullets are flying past your head, you run through a rope bridge and luckily a helicopter containing a machine gunner starts firing at you, you sprint as fast as you can, but the bridge snaps, you fall in the water and knocked unconscious. Moments after a man named Dennis finds you and aids you, he then gives you a machete, information on Vaas, and a 1911 handgun. The game then starts from here.
