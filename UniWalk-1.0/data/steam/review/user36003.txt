I waster all my ♥♥♥♥ weekend last christmas break.9/11 because you can be so cringe with it
This game is damn good, except that i was (well) confused with the Interface (no guide to collect resource, just basic controls and functions at the tutorial, etc)They absolutely need to make the game interface easier for newcomers, especially for the one whose doesn't understand DayZ or Realtime survival or else.
