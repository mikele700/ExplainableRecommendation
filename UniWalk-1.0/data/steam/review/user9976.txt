The ocean is a scary place. You are the last survivor of a spaceship crash and have escaped with the bare essentials. You plunge into the seemingly endless ocean in hopes of finding food and drinkable water to stay alive. The ocean is beautiful and full of resources. It's also full of things that want to kill you. By far, the best part of Subnautica is not knowing what's around the corner, seeing the resources you need and finding out how to get those resources. You'll go from surviving to thriving but never think you're invincible because, like our own ocean, this alien world has some messed up creatures who will mess you up. Subnautica is fun. When trying to explain the appeal to people I say 'It's like Minecraft but underwater' which does the game a disservice. Subnautica has some truly great things that are unique to it. The environment, particularly at night, is beautiful on any settings or rig. The game is about $30 AUD and well worth it.
Downwell is hard. I don't tend to like hard games, but I do like Downwell. For about $4 AUD this game is a bargain. Whenever I don't know what to play on Steam, Downwell draws me in. You'll probably play the game in quick bursts and die often. I can't even get past the cavern levels. The constant dying might wear you down but the game keeps you invested by awarding points at the end of each run which go into a progression bar which unlocks new play dynamics and new palettes. Downwell is simple in its execution and a very tight experience. Downwell does what it needs to do and does it perfectly.
