DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU LIVE IN AUSOr really any other place where there is not a really dense mass of people playing this game. Currently, I have found no public servers in my time playing the game. This means that when I hit -Play- it drops me into the nearest server it can find, which is probably hosting in Russia or something because I get about 5000ms ping. It-'s actually impossible to play sometimes, as in you can-'t move or anything because of this.I can live with there being no players, as long as the game is playable. But, there is no way to host your own server without paying somebody to do so, and I-'ve already wasted enough money on this game.When it is working, so far I have found no food in my ENTIRE PLAY TIME. Meaning I have starved to death WITH EVERY CHARACTER. I have encountered NO PLAYERS. And in fact, on the most recent update of the game I haven-'t even seen and zombies either.Pros:- NoneCons:- No players- No servers (Playing from Aus, this means I get so much ping the game is uplayable)- No local hosting- No zombies (This IS a zombie game, right?)- No supplies- When you do get a gun it-'s just before you-'re about to starve to death, and you-'re more likely to be smitten by god in all his fury than get ammo for it. There isn-'t anything to shoot at either- There is no merit in playing it, you can-'t even try to be the best player on the server because you are literally the only one- It-'s an hours run to get to anywhere (And you won-'t even find anything there most of the time)
