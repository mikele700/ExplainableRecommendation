Hey look! a bird's eye view, pixellated shooter! well this brings me back... might as well give it a shot, how long will it take to clock, half an hour?  ... Hang on, why am i dying?To anyone looking for a game with intuitive controls, a great electronic soundtrack, a plot that the developers actually seem to care about, and some amazing re-playability (not to mention lots and lots of violence), this is the game to beat.  As long as you can stomach harsh, gritty violence, this is an amazing and thought provoking game.
