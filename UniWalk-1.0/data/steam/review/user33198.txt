Nostalgia is a great thing.Good thing i had it b4 it was p2p.Thanks bethesda. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s
At first I thought this game was going to be another World of Tanks... God was I wrong, it was anything but. Having the information about planes and tanks gives u an insight as to how these tanks performed in combat and all the ammunition with it-'s speeds, explosive filler quantity, armour penetration capability. I-'ve just been diving head first into this game and it has helped me understand what took place during the second world war A LOT more than world of tanks ever did. ♥♥♥♥ I love this game and there are some questionable -features- but overall this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing10/10
Removes the need to eat irl. Social remover and eye strainer. 11/9 would lose soul again
In a world where good armour is almost no armour at all and bad armour is like wearing a reinforced steel door for armour, this game makes u reconsider female proportions and makes u wonder why you haven't been getting off to the store outfits.
This game is awesome. Gives u a good insight as to how american voice actors try sound german, scottish, Australian, russian and French, but nice try, the accents aren't that great ^_^.Anyways good game. you should download this and buy everything. :)
