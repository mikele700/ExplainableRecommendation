Good. Not enough memes however.
The game has reaction shots. 2k are just begging for a lawsuit from Finebros.
The eight hours I have on this game are all from just downloading without even a second of actual playtime.
This game is purely amazing. Complete your life and buy it now 10/10.
It is a fantastic game, just get it already. The hours on my account arent representative of the amount hours I have played. I have played hundreds of hours on the console version. Just get it if you havent already, it is great.
