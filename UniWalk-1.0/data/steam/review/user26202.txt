SO enraging
Best RPG 2nd to Skyrim a must have game, its amazing!
Great fun with friends if you cant be bothered to get the actuall board game
Had the best time of my life playing this game. I could never get over the joy of finding a new portion of the expansive map. I would reccommend this game to anyone, it's absolotely brilliant.All jokes aside the sound track is actually pretty good, keep it up.
