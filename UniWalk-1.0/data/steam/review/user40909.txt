this game.... this game is  not textured well, the fighting style is annoying.Over all, 1/10.... TERRIBLE!
This game is good fun!!!, although it dosen't have that spooky Atmospher like the others, but its still one of the best i play last year!Review 9.5/10 the story's fun
Brilliant Heist game, Good Graphics, really good on multi-player and not to mention but in this game u have multiple options to do the hiestover all i give it 9/10
If you Enjoy or Loved the Original Zeldas then this game, you would Enjoy cool gameplay class system & Obsession with CHICKENS of all things lol its Fun
