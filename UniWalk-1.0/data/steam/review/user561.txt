A very well done Td game, with a unique taste and art only worth the buy however if you wish to support the developers on there other games as kingdom rush is free online with a few features missing but more or less the same.
For those who DID enjoy Sid miers CIV 5 then Endless legend gives a fresh breath to the 4x genre where each faction actually has notable advantages and disadvantages where CIV 5 was strongly lacking
Amazing game, Amazing graphics but to those who lack a steering wheel good luck :D
♥♥♥♥ing zoom zoom, I think straight up if you're looking for whether or not this game is worth is soley dependent on if you enjoy casual games this game offers a somewhat medium to high range replayability, after completeing all the objectives the games difficulty definetely rises between each region so expect for alot of crashes and thats not even an understatement, so buy it if it's on sale definetely otherwise its simply whether you enjoy fast paced games
A very punishing yet rewarding game only 2 difficulties very easy or easy don't be fooled however as the difficulty ramps up very quickly.
Complete Bias RWBY FAN, Giving the Game a thumbs up :D
An amazingly well done Benchmarker definitely a worthwhile add to user whom really want to know what there getting out of there PC
♥♥♥♥ing stab your opponent in the heart as a starwhal what else is there you want from a  review worth your cash is very casual
This game though simplistic at first looks is actually a very indepth game with strategy and managment skills a must included with multiple maps the fun never ends also you get to be a train master
Amazing movie whether or not your a dota fan or not i belive it is a documentary worthwhile
