Whilst the game is overall really well designed and balanced, and incredibly fun, Unfortunately the PC version suffers, with NetCode so bad that it arguably becomes unplayable online. Lag spikes mean that for some characters, even performing simple special moves becomes effectively impossible, relying more on luck than actual skill.
The dark atmosphere, and art direction make this a great game, along with some brilliant writing. Unfortunatley stopping this game from being truly great is the combat, which feels clunky and repetetive, however the game is saved by these sequences being relatively sparse.It's puzzles are brilliantly designed, if a little bit obtuse, however this was rarely a problem.Overall the game is held down by it's combat and incredibly short length, and I was left wondering if maybe it wouldn't have been a better use of time creating a longer episode rather than releasing it in it's current length. However, it's puzzles, acting, design and incredible writing make this game a definite must play.
