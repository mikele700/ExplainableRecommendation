I hate Dota 2, this game is one of the most addictive out there but you will come to hate it. I still play this game and love it but one can not simply sit down and play a game of Dota without being constantly flamed for every single thing your teammates can think of. In other words the community is disgusting. Do not expect to be forgiven for anything but if you really can put in the hours to get decent at the game it is worth it. But please, watch some videos and learn a little bit before you play for the first time. If you dont and just dive in it will most certainly not be fun for you.On a better note though this game has an amazingly high skillcap which I am nowhere near at my lowly 2k mmr and you will keep wanting to come back and keep playing to hone your skills at every single hero in the game in a variety of roles. It does however make it so much easier to have a friend teach you some basics before you dive in at the deep end. Dota takes quite a while before you really start having a lot of fun but nce you do you will never go back, great to play both with friends as well as by yourself this game is bloody awesome. you will just have to put up with the community.
Totally amazing game, could not reccomend it more. It is brutally difficult but very rewarding once you get good, Anyone who has even remotely enjoyed a roguelike in the past should buy this game immediately. One of my favourite games of all time.
TF2 is great fun, the classes are balanced (mostly) and the variety of gamemodes and maps make me play it more and more, Oh and hats. Certainly one of the most enjoyable FPS's I hace played.
