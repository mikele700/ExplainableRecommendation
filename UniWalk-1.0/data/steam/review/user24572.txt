Play to win game, if you intend to play without spending money, good luck
Ok here we goPROS-Free-fun when it worksCONS-♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics-cannot LAN full stop-menu is buggered to hell-like pre alpha-alpha-bad graphics-sounds like cats getting run over everytime a chainsaw is present in a 500m radius-♥♥♥♥ weak ending-donator weapons, seriously?-crashes literally 2 seconds-cannot run with over 3 people without server pooping out-got literal ebola from playing-best game ever, 11/10--IGNi know it is still in development and it is free, but it has been in development longer than nuclear throne and a game this poorly stiched together should pay people to be beta testers for it. The horror element is how horribly it was designed
