I think no more room in hell is a brilliant game.it's a co-op fist person zombie survival shoot em up game with different maps and challanges.the feel of the game is great with the zombie horde pounding on the doors and fires burning in the buildings and a complete lack of electicity, and not to mention the moaning of the zombies, giving the game an overall creepy atmosphere.The interface is rather like that of hl2 but the weapon choosing panel differs from the original game making it much more user friendly.Over all a great mod for hl2 and i deffinately recommend it to other gamers.
