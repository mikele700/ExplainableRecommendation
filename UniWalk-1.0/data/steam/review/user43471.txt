Firstly, I have experienced Deepworld for much much longer than it was on steam.Admittedly, the Steam version is a bit shoddy. That's because the game was originally on Mac and iOS and is currently in the process of being ported to Windows. (I usually play on V2 Mac.) But if you check the updates, the V3 Steam version is slowly but constantly getting better, catching up to its v2 counterpart. Additionally, some of the microtransactions mentioned in negative reviews are on the way out. There's no more skill cap and now everyone gets unrestricted access to all biomes.Anyway, I should tell a bit about what Deepworld is.Deepworld is an online multiplayer sandbox game. A notable aspect is the fact that every single server/world is linked together via world teleporters. This makes it easy to travel between worlds, to go mining, exploring, questing, building, and so on. You can build something cool and show it to your friends or the public, or you can visit other people's creations. There's a place for everything.The sandbox aspect means you can build whatever you can think of. Building materials are easy to aquire.Remember: Deepworld is always in development. It will improve over time as more content is added to the game.
