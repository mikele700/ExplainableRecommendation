Risk of Rain is an axcellent game which will require a decent time investment to understand the basics. The combat feels fluid with most classes, and the item unlocks work in an interesting yet meaningfull way. Definitely not meatn to be easy, yet it still tops the current list of roguelike platformers currently available.
