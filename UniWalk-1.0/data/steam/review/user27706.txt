Do you have 60 dollars to throw away, but you feel that wiping your ♥♥♥ with it just isn't satisfying enough? Then buy No Man's Sky, cause either way, you'll be wasting your money on ♥♥♥♥. This cinematic game-play experience will make you feel like you are watching a child's finger painting be smeared across your eyeballs at an impressive 10 frames per second, and an even better 2 fps if you wanna get off the first god forsaken planet in this procedurally generated Dumpster. And be sure to never tab out of the game, cause when it crashes, it doesn't close, just hangs around in the background of your computer, slowly ticking away at time played, ensuring that any investment is a permanent one. Hello Games and Steam must be in bed together because once you go a minute over the appeal time 2 hours for a refund, your requests for your money back get sent through the machine, no human eyes will ever gaze upon your appeal, no matter how valid your reasoning is.Hopefully, steam games will now come with a bottle of lube, cause when steams refund policy decides to bend you over a barrel, it should make it easier on the both of you.
