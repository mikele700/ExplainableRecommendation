Half-Life, The classic FPS in 1998, loved this franchise since i was young and enjoyed playing this and all the sequels.HALF LIFE 3!-Matrix
Such a classic, You can never go wrong with the Grand Theft Auto franchise, Wonderful gameSadly the community in-game are all cruel, but the campaign is strong and playing with friends is hours of fun!-Matrix
Splendid game, Wonderful environment, hours of fun playing this beauty.One of the most hyped game I have played but definitely delivered in the graphics department!Gameplay & Story line is also good but with a short play time, I completed the whole thing in under 6 and a half hours.All in all, Great Game!-Matrix
Great Game to play, enjoyed it thoroughly. would recommend it to anyone :)
Absolutely Great Game! I love playing this game! both Wasteland & DayZ are great to play with friends! i made so many great friends through this game!
Absolutely great game, spent many hours playing it, and its previous game Civ IV! A must buy in my own opinion, Great fun with friends. The expansions make it even more enjoyable!
Dota 2, hours of fun spent playing this game with friends and by myself.Massive archive of heroes, items, and equiptment to purchase on the store. Loved this game for so long & loved WC3 too!-Matrix
Excellent Game to play with friends, a must buy in my books!Good community and yet another wonderful classic created by Valve themself.Can't wait for sequels and more games from this franchise to be released-Matirx
