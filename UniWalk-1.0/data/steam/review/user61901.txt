Sepia Tears is a F2P Visual Novel which has a rather romantic plot structure to it. The story is perhaps one of the best I have seen in while, at most times remaining cryptic and mysterious until the final part of the game came around. Now not giving much away about the ending but I personally found it very satisfying and the build up really made you emotionally invested in the protagonist so it made the ending that much more impacful. The game takes around 4-5 hours to complete depending on how fast you read and what choices you make. Now I have only played through this once and got the good ending, but I am assuming there are some other (worse?) ones (When I play a VN that is heavy in the feels, I tend not to even look up nor play the bad endings). Overall this game has a solid story, a solid soundtrack, and solid artwork, A must play for any visual novel fan, and hey its free (which is actually rather suprising for a game this refined).Verdict: 7.5/10Now please excuse me as I take heat from all the people on my friends list calling me a weaboo for playing anything that remotely contains anime.
