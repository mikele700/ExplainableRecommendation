I started my time playing cs back on css, i found out that a new game of cs came out and though that i would just stay with css. I was wrong... cs go in my opinion is the best cs out of all of them. I would strongly recomend this game to anyone looking for a good fps game or a want to play a game with friends. I rate this game a solid 9/10. great game. Thanks valve.
rust is a great game i love it. BUY IT!!
