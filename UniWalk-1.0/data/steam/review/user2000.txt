This game has gone through VERY BIG rough patches with Kabam. However DECA games brings hope to ROTMG to show this game's full potential. Very excited to see what happens.
NO PORT FORWARD NEEDED TO HOST! YUSSi have been waiting a long time for multiplayer to come out and i was heartbroken when Klei Entertainment said there wouldn't be a multiplayer but they changed their minds and now there is and it is worth every cent. Amazing 10/10
think of any board game and ill bet on it that you can play it in TTS (TableTop Simulator).
octodad is a excellent game for everyone. true it has a short storyline but the workshop makes up for it. oh and when you die the screen goes purple :D PURPLE
