Tjis is the game I have waited years to play, for fans of harvest moon or casual RPG's alike and even hardcore gamers and eliteists. The art styule is lovely, the ambience and music of the game suits perfectly and the characters all have real life to them. Thank you Concerned Ape, for making the game myself and many others have dreamed about for years and thank you for giving us so much more than Harvest Moon ever did.
I would take an arrow to the knee to play this game constantly.
