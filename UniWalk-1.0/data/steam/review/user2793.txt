This dlc is spoiler heavy and should only be played after completing the Sleeping Dogs main story.Nightmare in North Point is a pretty cool little dlc, it has a humorous storyline, but a few bugs as well. Hong Kong is transformed into a dark and rainy nightmare, with a two hour main story as well as several new events and side missions scattered across the city.There is a bug when fighting the vampire spirits, they will latch onto you, and there is an on screen prompt that tells you how to push them off-- but it only works half the time, and you will often frustratingly have to helplessly watch your life bar slowly tick down to zero.There is only one item of clothing that can be unlocked and used in the main game, and its not even smiley cats mask, which everyone wants. Overall, this is a unique and fun dlc, however I don't think it is worth 7USD, but its definately still worth getting on sale. I personally think this could have been integrated into the main game instead of as a dlc to make the main game just that little bit more content rich.

Great reboot, can't wait for the sequel. Unfortunately, however, I will have to wait a bit longer. Thanks Bill Gates.
A very simple game in the world of MOBAs. The controls are great, the pet system is awesome and you can access all heroes from the start, much like in DoTA. The story/lore also feels very alive thanks to the tutorial campaign and great voice acting. I will play it more if/when an oceanic server comes out.
a good spook  2/2
