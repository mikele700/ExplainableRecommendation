UPDATE: Okay, so I've played some more now and it does struggle with the frame rate at some points. I don't have access to my desktop computer so I'm not sure how it runs on a proper gaming machine. Still very playable overall.ORIGINALIt runs perfectly on my laptop. i7 4700 and GTX850m. Windows 8.1.Most people probably know about this game already but here goes anyway. It's a bad Final Fantasy but still a fun game. I put 100 hours into it on the PS3 and I'm sure I'll put many more into the PC version as well. Looking forward to the rest of the trilogy being released on steam.Final Fantasy XIII has very pretty scenery, nice music and a fairly fun battle system that keeps you on your toes a lot more often than most other Final Fantasies. The levelling up system is a bit meh, but is enough to make me want to see the tree expand. The story itself has some good moments and I felt a flood of memories coming back to me as I saw each character appear on the screen. Looking forward to completing it on the PC and reliving the adventure.
Fantastic game. My friends and I had a blast on 4 player coop. Absolutely amazing that they'd making this amazing game and release it for free!
