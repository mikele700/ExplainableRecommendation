I played this little delight back before it came out on steam, I didn't come in with much but I was surprised at how quick I became invested in the character 'Mach'.The characters are charming and memorable even after just 1 playthrough and I enjoyed the references to Starcraft 2, granted I didn't know half the terms  even though I play the game but thats why this game has an extremely helpful glossary! The music is a joy to listen to and the art of the characters and backgrounds is really well done!Overall I'm already a big fan of this game and I'm very excited about its future and where the devs go with their new found success.Plus its FREE, what have you got to lose besides a bit of your time?
