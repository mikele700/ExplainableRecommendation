the absolute most fun i've ever had out of a simulation (its not exactly a game, but god damn is it fun).seriously makes you consider just how massive space truly is and the physics and tools in this simulation are superb, not to mention the graphics. you can have a super low end mac like mine and it runs smooth af and looks amazing.favourite item in my steam library hands down (tad bias coming from a space fanatic but hey, its bloody sweet)
I haven't had don't starve long, but i can tell people with confidence that this is a game that is defiantly worth the money. It has a great art style and is very easy to pick up and play, as you will learn as you go. Its that easy, and makes it that much more fun
So simple yet so fun, this game will make you love it and hate it. The only objective is literally the title, and there is no better way of stating it.
This game is already in the bad books for gamers this year on console, and the pc version in no way any better. In fact, this game on pc is one of the worst games I've played. Unless you have a high powered gaming pc to use, you'll experience terrible framerate on most maps and badly loaded textures. The DLC started of alright, but has steadly gotten worse and more boring with each release. This is definatly a downgrade from previous call of dutys like black ops 2 and mw2. Not really worth buying.
This is definatly one of the most creative games ever. Allowing you to do as you please, Garrys Mod allows for the most random singleplayer and multiplayer fun! Whether it be riding dinosaurs to exploding a nuke to crash your game, Gmod has it all.
Easily my favourtie first person shooter of all time. Fast paced, funny and the whole 3-D cartoon-like style of the game makes it even more fun to play!
