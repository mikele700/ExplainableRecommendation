So I just managed to get up to level 8, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ there is so much hidden content in this game. By the time you've finished the game (a task so difficult I applaud those who have done it) you can go back and play over and over again just due to the amount of content available. If you are even considering buying this game, trust me and take the risk. It is one of the most fullfilling games I have played of late, highly reccomended.
