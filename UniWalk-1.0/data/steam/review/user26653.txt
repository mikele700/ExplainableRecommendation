Really good for a 10 dollar game, well worth it.Very nice sountracks. TONNES of stuff to do and a good singleplayer as well as multiplayer experiences. I found myself 24 houring this game, never really is 'nothing else' to do. Big promising updates for the game, not very often though from what I remember.I have no major negatives of this game that I can pick out, only that there is alot of items and I find myself on the wiki a bit.8/10 still play.
Launch game, starts right awaySeems to be the tuturialHave to build execution chamber all g then having trouble trying to build itno info at allneeds proper tuturials Interesting game 6/10but...Not for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like me
Decent for beta stage or whatever it is inBeginning is a bit confusingEndgame is kinda boringGreat for betaWill be worth the buy since it is not 100% and still lots of stuff to be added
Favourite game of childhood, and still is my favourite game now. Star Wars is my life K.
