First of all, this game is gorgeous. The style is beautiful, and it's well worth taking a glance over the horizon at any time of day.I've only played on the Pilgrim setting so far (The Long Dark's version of an Easy setting where wildlife doesn't attack you) and even without any combat elements this game is incredibly fun. I get excited about finding new places. Surviving is challenging but not so much that you just want to give up (that said, you have to be smart; i wasn't watching where I was going and fell off a cliff, and there's no respawn here.)  And despite knowing I had combat off, walking down the long dark corridor at the Hydroelectic plant made me a little bit uneasy. The atmosphere in the game in unrivaled.
I honestly knew very little about this game when I bought it; I knew it had a bit of a following and had won a few gaming awards, but that was about it. I never expected this game to have the storytelling prowess and emotional power it had over me. I found I couldn't stop playing until I knew how the story would end, and I walked away from the game feeling better for it. The graphics on this game are absolutely gorgeous, the attention to detail  and atmosphere staggering, and the story riveting and surprisingly easy to relate to. For anyone looking for an immersive gaming experience or interactive storytelling, I highly recommend Gone Home.
Not only is this game flippin' gorgeous, there's nothing more satisfying that shooting people in the face and them go about their daily lives with an arrow in their face.
