I got hundreds of hours on this, then Overkill decided to add microtransactions on top of their $100 worth of DLC. You have a chance of getting skin that adds stat boosts to push your guns past break points by opening one of their safes, or you can pay extra on the market for these pay to win skins. It's really disappointing what happened to this game.
It would be a good game if anyone played it.
