I played this awesome game since a few weeks ago. My gaming rig is Ubuntu Linux 16.04 running on Intel Xeon E3 + Nvidia GTX760 + Samsung 950 PRO.The game will complain about the drive(nvidia 361) but it will run anyway. I set graphics quality to HIGH and the framerate is bearable for a turn based game. For about 30 hours I played, it crashed once, and froze for a minute when my sharpshooter tried headshot a Archon. Other than that everything was wonderful.Ranger is pretty OP from what I've seen. It's great that 1 soldier can carry the other knocked down yet still alive soldier to a safe place. Also the concealed mode is a nice addition to existing tactical elements.
