Why are you even reading this? Seriously, you already have it
do you want a game where you can use a bannana to kill fin the human, kill people by smashing pokemon onto people?well then garrys mod is the game for you...9999.99 out of 1
I payed for the Ultimate Edition for this, a year later I've still not gotten the DLC for this game, just the base game
Murdering a chicken= 1,000 bounty. Only in Skyrim
I was really looking forward to playing this mod. Infact, one of the main reasons I got Just Cause 2 was to play this mod. But when I tried to boot it up, it crashed straight away. I think it's because of my A.M.D. hardware, so if you want to play this game with an A.M.D. video card, you'd better hope that the team updates the game to support A.M.D. video cards.
