At the point of me writing this review i have a grand total of 0.4 hours spent.I absolutely love this game, the fun mix of Super Smash Bros. with the addictive gameplay of the minigames in Battleblock Theatre. and the best part is that to get in on the action is easy. just sign upUnfortunately at the current Beta, the only server is based in America, living in Australia made this difficult to have an immersive fight with someone across the globe.Trust me when i say this, follow this game, it is going to be something big
70 hours playing this gamestill have no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on11/10
I love this game. I really do. But I strongly advise not to buy this game until it is fully released. Or at least not for the current full price.Pros:-This game can be really pretty if you have a good enough PC-The cannibals are terrifying-Nice inventory and crafting -Lots of stuff to build and doCons:-Can run like ♥♥♥♥ if it is being played on a 'low-end' PC-Glitches Galore!-The storyline is kinda boring-I dont even remember the storyline right now-Co-op needs to be overhauled and fixedOverall, i give this game a 6/10 in it's current state
