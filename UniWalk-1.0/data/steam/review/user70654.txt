Took me a while to adjust after playing source for such a long period of time, but really enjoying it now! :)
Chased deer around for 15 minutes, shot a deer and it didn't die, got stuck on a rock and couldn't jump off the rock. Decided to try shoot down eagles, didn't work so I decided to go throw my cat out the window and try hit it mid air with a lampshade.
