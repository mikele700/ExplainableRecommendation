well i mean the game looks like a pube but i guess im used to it since i only have a stapler with a AA battery taped to it, but its ok because the little sticker on the corner says intel inside (nah s**t m8).this game is gud if u want to feel like your some kind of faze clan kid who is just dinkin zambies with every shot and slamming more zambies with paddle.all in all if ur looking for a game where u can do dumb s**t but u cant buy gmod id recomend downloading this game and then finding a car jack so u can make a car fall on top of a zombie (you will understand when u find a car and a car jack in the game)one thing i should warn u about, multiplayer is full of squeakers calling u out for hax when all u did was run them over with a car while beeping and strobing ur headlights.i hope this reveiw helped ur decision to install a 50mb game for free or that u at least felt my pain for my computer that is about as gud as creating a review when u should be studiyin for a super life skill full geography exam.
