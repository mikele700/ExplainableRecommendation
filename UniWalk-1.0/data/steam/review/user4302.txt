I love this game! It really doesn't matter whether your planing on playing this game with friends, or by yourself; This game is allways, ALLWAYS a blast.

Me before playing: 'Oh, it-'s just a Minecraft+Dayz cash-grab...I-'ll probably play 10 minutes or so...-Me after playing 10 minutes: 'This game is WAAAAY to good to be free.-Me now: 'It-'s...It-'s...It-'s Incredible!-
Great fun with randoms. Even more fun with friends! I recomend this game to anyone that is a fan of survival games or has friends looking for a game to get stuck into.
