i have to say it is fun at first but it gets repedetive doing the same things over and over again
shove rocks up your *** 11/10
this is a great game if u liked rust legacy u will enjoy this (exept theres no willies) its kinda hard to get food especially when EVERY single animal even deers try to kill you. theres a sasquatch to hunt for which is cool.
i tried to jump i did it but my head didnt make it i flailed to the ground and lost 10/10 would lose my head again
inmature simulator aka garrys mod is a cool game where u make things with stuff like a bathtub and u cannot go a week without downloading atleast 1 addon lituarly every server has atleast 100 addons anyway i REALLY recommend this game its very addictive and yeah
i have no armour and only five hearts BUT I GOT A YOYO SO LETS FIGHT EYE OF CTHULU!!
