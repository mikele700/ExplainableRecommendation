:D Best Game Ever 10/10The game by itself is boring, but with the right mods and right games, you can have a fun time with friends :D
This game is simply amazing.I know the FPS may be bad at stages and the bugs and glitches may be annoying, but hey, it's ARMA. A3 is an amazing game and even more amazing with mods. Never can I say I have seen another game where I can screech in my F-18 Super Hornet over a bunch of ISIS Militants in a fictional town in the middle east. The multiplayer is simply amazing as well however, buggy at times. I did not enjoy the gameplay very much at the start but when I added the necessary mods, it was a master piece.9.8/10TLDR - PRO: Amazing game with great core gameplay CON: Minor and Major bugs and FPS IssueTip: Accompanied with right mods, it is a master piece
Was well worth my time. Very non-linear story line packed with plot twists and choices.
Yeah.It's alright.
