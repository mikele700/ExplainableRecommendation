A great 10 hour single-player story.If you enjoyed Deux Ex, Assassins Creed (modern-day single-player sections) and Portal games, you'll enjoy this.No openworld and no 100+ weapon choices may feel like you're railroaded and just along for the ride, but at least it's an interesting one.
It wouldn't be a Kalypso game without some sort of troubleshooting:http://steamcommunity.com/app/23450/discussions/#p2
