ok for those who don't know garrys mod is a sandbox. a game where you can make anything and everything (apparetly) ok what about if im not that inventive. well we have steam workshop support. well whats on the workshop you may ask.well theys pretty much anything you can inmagine. ok well i want a giant flying naked woman.mmmmmm sorry don't have that. ok how bout a horse i can ride on. sorry don't have that either. fine how bout this map a server is running. sorry don't have that. so what else i can do. well theres multiplayer. ok? it hosts everysort of gametype you can think of. so i join a rp server and i find its filled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥s breaking everyrule on the server from killing people to traping them and vehicles against walls and the admins are no where to be found. so i went stuff it and moved on to another rp server where it has a leveling system so i was in a stuation where im only level 3 when everyone else is level fifty billon or something just as bull ♥♥♥♥. so it ends up you emptying every single bullet in your gun and reserve and still not kill them yet you can't seam to take two rounds before dieing. the reason why leveling systems work in games say fallout its because its single player and the levels adjust for the diffculty. the reason why levels don't work with a multiplayer game such as gmod is because the maps are small and the low level players are stuck playing with high level scumbags and you end up in a situation where your trying to protect your home and you can't kill him because he has a health of one million(or something just as stupid) and you end up dieing to one or two hits so i went ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to it and i just played single player. it kept me busy for a bit but you end up with ♥♥♥♥ all to do. some might say im being to hard on it its just a ten doller game some might say im to hard to please and some of them can shut the ♥♥♥♥ up.
this game is awsome:D
