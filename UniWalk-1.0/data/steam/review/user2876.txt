one of the best games that i have ever played in my life.its great collecting new weapons and hats, and always alot of fun to play online or offline, by yourself or with friends.9.5/10
if you dont get it, your crazy or theres somting wrong with you10/10
hell fun to just hack and slash and blow up zombies to your hearts content.the only problem with it is the lag, you need a pretty decent computer to run this game properly.for that I give it around a 7/10 or maybe less
