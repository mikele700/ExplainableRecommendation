Fire the sound team and once you do 10/10 but for now 8/10
Never played it but it gets rid of a significant amount of Garry's Mod ERROR models and such.

The game is great-don't get me wrong but the amount of crap that goes on really out balances the fun.-HackersThe game is plagued with hackers, I even managed to make friends with one and they told me about all the crazy stuff they can do like x-ray vision, all blueprints, a forcefield where if someone enters the vicinity it kills them, speedhacks, rangefinders, aimbots and so much more.-Admins.  So, you play on a server for a while and then it goes three waysa) Map resetb) Admin uses invisibility and spawns C4 and stuffs up your base.c) A hacker joins the server and owns everyone whilst the admin is busy with a finger up their ♥♥♥ and VAC is doing its work which takes a while.So really, when you buy Rust, there's a hidden server fee unless you want to get owned and owned again by any of this.  -GlitchesThere are these cracker ♥♥♥ rock bases where people can build structures inside of rocks and unless you get really lucky or have a hacker friend to x-ray the heck out of the map to find these bases or the admin does something, you really have no chance to win against theses guys because the have a super safe house.-DevelopmentSo Facepunch is working on a reboot which makes the game much easy to update and what not.  This is all fun and dandy except this means the rock bases and other glitches I don't even know about go unpatched for ages until this reboot is done.
gets boring way to fast.
Luckily, I bought this game at a steal price because I am shocked to see no Australian server option.  The game looks like fun and I was looking forward to playing it but playing on 300+ ping servers definitely give me an unfair disadvantage.Don't get me wrong, the game plays nicely and looks quite good but until you sort out your server agenda I'm afraid I'm gonna down rate this game.  Maybe have a server browser which people can start dedicated servers on or create an offline bots mode later on in development?Until then, I'm afraid it's a no go from me :(
Game still isnt 100 percent perfect and there's a lot missing but it is Alpha and missing content is obvious and understandable.  The game is a lot of fun!Original post:Performance Issues.Massive lag spikes when turning around or really doing anything for over 5 seconds. The Ping bar is broken and anti-aliasing is broken.BUT IT'S ALPHA!!!?!?! HOW CAN YOU GIVE A NEGATIVE REVIEW??!!I'm reviewing the game in its current state for me - the devs made a conscious decision and chose to release the game in this state and I'm not going to hold back on giving a negative review.Aw yeah the actual game, if you overlook the horrid aids ebola performance is actually amazing.
