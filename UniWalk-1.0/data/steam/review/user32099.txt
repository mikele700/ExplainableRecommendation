Having played this game fully, finding all secrets etc.  I will say this, imscared is a truly unique game.  It combines interesting storytelling and very tricky puzzles to create an experience that you (hopefully) won't soon forget.  I for one am glad to see that Steam is starting to accept games that use the techniques used in this game.
Game has no sound, some of the gameplay and ALL of the humor relies on the sound.  Unless Jackbox games fixes this issue, I can not recommend this.  Shame too, YDKJ was one of my favourites when I was a kid.  If I could rate all of the, at once, I would probably downvote them all apart from volume 6 since it is the ONLY one to have sound for me.
