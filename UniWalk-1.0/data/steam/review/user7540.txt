Pretty good game. I like it. You would think driving a car around is pretty boring (why not just do it in real life?) but the quests and surprising difficulties of driving a 15 metre long truck make it quite engaging.Some suggestions:I was surprised to find no indicator option, and I think the ideal thing would be to have right and left click for right and left indicator.Also windscreen wipers.Please tell me if these controls are available in the game.
