I feel like I have played enough hours of suicide, glitching, laughter, and stupidity to finally write a review for this game that does it justice.This game is F**king amazing. One can not simply grasp how awesome it is, in less than 2 hours of play time. There are so many creative ways to kill yourself, and all these cool tricks to help you be random and have fun.There are also so many glitches that will wet your whistle when the standard gameplay bores you. Example: as the baby grab the piano, get on top of it, then  move and jump. You will legit fly. If you go under tables, you can make the table fly. I made table fly, 12/11 would play again.Table flying action is a much relief to when drinking bleach, drowning yourself, and electrifying yourself become a bore.This game is also possibly the only situation when you would ever say -Oh crap, I drowned myself too quickly. Ahhh, I am not cooking in the oven.* This game also tinkles the tastebuds of aspiring house husbands and masterchefs, with the addition of the cooking chore.12/10 recommend.
One of my favorite games ever, it is just always fun, random, simply to grasp but hard to be fun at and there is hats! The game overall is highly enjoyable and I recommend to anyone who wants a free shooter which is amazing and always fun!!!
