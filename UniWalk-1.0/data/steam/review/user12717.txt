Mad as game.11/10 Would shoot toilet again.
It takes 5 minutes the finish this game but I went back and decided to play it a second time it was that good.
Fistful of Frags is a good western FPS with a few different game modes and quite an amount of wepons. Fistful of Frags is one of those game like TF2 and CSGO that don't really get old.
Garry's Mod is an amazing game, with endless amounts of things to do. If you don't think there's enough, just go to the WorkShop and download some add-ons. I have had so much fun in the past, there are so many different game modes to play which is what I love about it. Getting on the game every now-and-than and screwing around with your friends building the most stupid things.
Tomb Raider is probably the best game I have ever played. It has the most amount of emotion and the graphics are phenomenol; I got stuck into the story so much, the combat is pretty amazing and I loved the parkour. Kinda disappointed that they abandoned the Multi-Player. Definitely would recommend this game.
