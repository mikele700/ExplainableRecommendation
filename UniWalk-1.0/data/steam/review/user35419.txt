Its definitely an enjoyable game and I would recommend it to people if they had the money to buy it/
ONE TEAM ONE DREAMJust tbh the first few times you play will make you turned off from the game as the environment is extremely harsh, but playing with friends is extremely enjoyable.
I wouldn't be joking if I said this game was good. Its fun, but make sure you have a group of friends as sometimes it gets a little boring by yourself.9/10 would buy all the DLCs (if you really wanna, your cash, your decisions) and Payday's on discount too :)
