Well, I've put 100 hours of my life into my game, so I believe it's time to send my opinion.Let's start with the pros:- Extensive Replayability- Short learning curve, easy to play- Huge options- Choices on what to do.And let's go with the cons:- Reported crashes, frequent crashes on the game- Very little/no chance that the game will ever be updated- No chance of a sequelThis game, is EXTREMELY fun, you can now finally live out your fantasy of turning North Korea into a superpower that matches the US in size and power! Or perhaps you wish to nuke Israel, get payback against China or even re-establish the apartheid in South Africa. This game really challenges you to make the future different, although it isn't THAT realistic, it still is fun. However, there are some issues, the saddest part of this game is that the company that made it, went bust (to my knowledge) so there will be no chance of a sequel unless another company picks it up. Also reports of widespread bugs that make the game unplayable, which is sad, the only patch, the 1st patch, was released, and you can expect no other updates.Overall I recommend it, it's heaps of fun, and for me, it works well. I just wish some of the most annoying bugs could be fixed and the game could be improved on.
It's really addictive, 10/10, like Skyrim with Guns
