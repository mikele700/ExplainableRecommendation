I stepped out of the Red Light Loft after loading into the game. I then went to my garage and selected my beautiful blue and black Phoenix. After doing so, I checked my map, to see where the closest mission was. As I was doing so, a cop that was walking along jumped in my car and took off. In alarm, I went back to the garage and selected my Voxel. The chase was on. Weaving in and out of traffic to catch my car. Being a bit of a clumsy driver, I collected notoriety from the police, and cops were swarming me. Through this struggle, my Voxel blew up. I could just see my beloved Phoenix in the distance. I could not give up. I stole a civilianâ€™s varsity and was back on the chase. Unfortunately, this truck is slower than my other cars, and with police still swarming me, I lost the chase. -No matter, I-'ll just spawn it in again,- I thought. Upon returning to my loft-'s garage, I made the horrifying discovery that my beautiful, beloved Phoenix had been removed. As I started to grieve, I realised there was a way to fix this. I loaded the save before this crime was committed.After doing so, I proceeded to check if my Phoenix was in my garage, it was. Full of relief, I selected it, and went to my map. Again, whilst doing so, a pedestrian came to my car. This time, I was prepared. As she swung my car door open, I swiftly ran over and beat her to a pulp. This, of course, attracted the police. I then proceeded to get in my car and drive away.10/10 would play over and over again
