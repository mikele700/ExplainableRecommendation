At the release of Payday Overkill said that payday would never have microtransations and now almost all weapons need DLC and now there are cases that NEEDS you to but a key to unlock.Payday 2 is now only about making Overkill money and have not taken the communities ideas in forever. Don't bother getting Payday unless you have $20 for the game and ANOTHER $50 just for DLC then can play for the cases. And finally payday 2 is just a game for people who want to grind for a thousand hours and i can think of 10 better grinding games straight away. please don't bother unless your rich.
This game is AMAZING it isn't the most stable game but the amount of content is worth it and it's still on in beta. The weapons and effects are beautiful and there is no real need for the mircotransactions, they can be completely ignored.
