An updated version of the original, and it's infinitely better x3
This game is fast, and well, it's fun. Also, chickens! OuO
The countless hours of fun (well, we can count them, cuz it's steam) playing this game! You never know what will happen in the dark, forbidding basement of Isaac's House.
Play it and get a heart attack ... ♥♥♥♥♥in'...
