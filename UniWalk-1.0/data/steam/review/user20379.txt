No hud, no ammo indicator, no crosshair and no other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's just you, your gun and your brains. This game also has really cool game modes that I find very enjoyable. This is one of the best fps games I've played in quite some time. A must buy!
It's a good game but the community is infested with griefers, toxic teammates and hackers so beware.
