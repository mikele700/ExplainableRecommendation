Its such a shame at seeing the good people with 2000+ hours leaving this game. I dont blame them though, tf2 is kinda being not as good as it used to be now. However, the unique gameplay makes it fun to play and ultimately end up wasting your life and making your credit card crash and burn. But still, tf2 is still tf2. In my opinion, Tf2>Cs>Cod>My goldfish's memory>Getting an F for your report>Valve.Thanks Valve for not caring for tf2 anymore :cStill play the game though, its fun c:
