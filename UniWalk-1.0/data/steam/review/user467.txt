for an incomplete game to provide this much creativity and fun. cant wait for full release .
the best aspect of the game in my opinion is being dracula himself. you never get tired of running around feeling like a badass. the game does have some negative aspects which completly changes gameplay to the point of it being another game entirely ( i.e sneaking around guards you can never ever kill...). the combat beats gods of war in my opinion.
