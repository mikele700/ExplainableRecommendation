Made a planet explode with a giant space laser.10/10 This game is so much fun.
A really fast paced platformer. It has amazing mechanics and level design. A really fun game to play by your self and with friends10/10
FTL, is an amazing game but there is just one catch, you die. I'll thell you a story there i was floating in a glorious nebula (looking at the wonderful site) and then i move on sector, i'm the boarded by robots which then proceed to kill mot of my crew members (leaving 2 out of 5 alive), they then go and destroy my oxygen system thus suffocating the rest of my crew.you will die quite a lot, but it is amazing.100/10
A very fun zombie survival game and is worth playing, but it is better to play it in multiplayer as opposed to single player. Has it's ups and downs.9.5/10
This an amazing game, but can be very stressful at times. When you start to play this game it is very difficult but after the first 20 hours or so, you start to get better at the game and you might even continue playing it for many more hours. The graphic quality is beautiful, gameplay is smooth.The only down side i can think of is it is a damanding game, but  other than that over all amazing, it is worth downloading.
Starbound is amazing and it is worth spending the money for it.
