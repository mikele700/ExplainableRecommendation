I can't believe it took this long to find a fantastic game to play when it has been sitting right in front of me this hole time. It took me a bit long to finish this game than I had excecpted but I finished it off and I thoroughly enjoyed this game! can't wait to play the next game. This game has alot of action in it and creepy dark rooms, with blood stainds all over the wall, but it isn't just all action and glamor. There is a really good quailty story line, and to be honest it has one of the best storylines ive play in ages so to rap it up 'Would you kindly', go and play this amazing game.
This is a first person shooter (fps) and 4 person co-op game that fankly i could play for days and days to end ;there is so much you can do in borderlands 2 including killing big bosses the size of a 10 story building or vs a midget that you could listen to screming about nothing for about 30 seconds before you blow there head into a million tiny little pathetic pieces. I reckon that borderlands 2 is the best game i have even played and i think i'l be playing it for a long time to come.
