Great game where you jump to the music to avoid obstacles. Also has a Level editor so you can create and share your levels .
I love GA but it needs Steam workshop compatibility for the adventures seeing that maxis and the Spore servers (For online stuff) got shut down
This game has nice graphics, awesome gameplay & a range of different people you can play as each with it's own unique storyline.
An Awesome Game. You will love it
