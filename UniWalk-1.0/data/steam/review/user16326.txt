at first this game was fun and awesome ton of stuff to do now before all the fanboys eat me alive i want sya somthing i had the non steam version for a while i lost so i got the steam one so i had about 500+ hours on my non steam version so i know what am talking about but there are some good things+ modsalmost all the bad things can be fixed but i am the 3% of the gamers that play the game 100% mod free atleast until i have done the games  storyline, after i had done the game i put some mods on the game and i loved it and so many of them were lore friendly +graphics the game look very good better than oblivion plus mod can make it look better - walking walking walkingi hate games e.g like pokamon cos you walk every were!!!!!!!! without being attacked by somthing and the horses a too slow - lame combat it feels so lifeless yes the animations are cool but it so annoying and the enemys god it is like they are made of steel and it gets more annoying at the end when you know your weapons should be more than enough to kill your enemys - lags and loading i don't have a $3,000 high end PC but it can play most games but god it lags alot and even if it just me i know that that the loading screens are TOO LONG!!!!!-being evil i am going to say this one time if you kill half of white run and all you have to do is pay a fee of stay in jail for a second and after that no one seem to mind that you just killed every thing in site 5/10 sorry for the bad english i am part aussie and mostly mexican
this game is awesome it's like no mech game ever playedone thing i like about this game is you don't haft to play to win most f2ps you must buy better gear to win but no hawken you can own  enemys with your TV with legs also the game is well thought out no mech are too op and no mechs are too weak  but there is only one i hate about this game the money system ok i get it play well enough you get more money but what they need is a level up rerordyou know 1000 hawken credit and 500 metior credit some thing like that the game runs well (if not check what contury your servers are playing on and it looks pritty good total rating i would say 8/10 very good and FREE TO PLAY!!!!!!!
i like valve games and the fan bases mods but this one -_-it lAGS OUT YOUR PC i you are trying to make a zombie hord mapgets old vey fast you need all the valve games to play on any server with out error and i got 75% of their gamestotal rating 5/10 needs some work
i'll make this short+ very fun+ the super portal looks awesome+ longer than episode one+ awesome antlion nest map+  new combie MPC   the hunter+ new antlion MPCS antloin worker and antlion gaurdian + play through a level with a vortagunt (normaly you are just with alyx)+ alyx is still hot <---- inproper reason -  no new weapons you can use-  no new zombie types at least a rebel with a head crab on him/her-  sad ending <---- inproper reason -  you DO NOT GET TO KILL THAT !@#@$%^andviser that killed eli!!!!!!final rating 9/10
