the control scheme imo is way to over complicated i would like to get past that but it makes the game feel like a chore to play and it would be nothing if it wasnt for the mods the comunity makes for it such as altis life
awesome game well done bethesda
bat sheet crazy fun
simple yet complex and it also ahs perma death so dont go too hard
