It was OK but only took less then an hour. I don't recommend it just because of that.
A really intense racer. The mario kart of PC.  Graphics are top notch. Controls are as smooth as butter. This rollercoaster of a story will have you in tears by the end. The music puts Hans Zimmer to shame.
A masterpiece
It's boring. It's overrated. It's dull.
Bad game. You can trust me. My play time is high
