Left 4 Dead 2 is the most funnest game I ever played! A little difficult, but that-'s what makes the game fun. But then it becomes the most crappiest game ever because THE COMMUNITY SUCKS! I played on a lot of servers and most of them contains a$$holes, know-it-alls, perverts, bossy and much more. I met a few people who were fun to play with. Notice the keyword -few-. I met, like, one or three. That-'s it. The rest just really sucks. I-'ve been kicked from three/two serevers for making one or two mistakes. The community is basically saying -You have to be perfect at this game. Nobody wants newbies to play-. Now I-'m too scared to play with other people because they-'re just a$$holes.I recommened this game because it-'s fun -in single player-, but I advise you to stay away from the servers. It-'s for your own good. (P.S i todally didn-'t steal one of my firends review >:3)
Garrys Mod is a awesome game i luv it so much that i've played it for a year and yes i know there are MORE people who play Garry's Mod more then me like 5-10 years be odd right? o_o But yea great game and good RP and other game types oh and FNAF (HINT its scary and came from scot)
