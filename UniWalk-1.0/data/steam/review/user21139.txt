pls this game is mad goodpros:- you can dive- you can kick- kicks are strong- kicks are way cooler than lame punches- street fighter aint got ♥♥♥♥- diving makes kicking even better- there are more than 2 characterscons:-???-perhaps not enough kicking
Are you medically trained?lel no, good thing there's surgeon simulator so you can use a ♥♥♥♥ing surgical axe to cut a still living man's brain out of his skull and then proceed to replace it with a new one by throwing it from three point range, so you can remove an entire ribcage with the swing of a hammer, so you can cause collateral damage in internal bleeding with a laser. Does none of this appeal to you? Well ♥♥♥♥ you it will when you're in space doing it. Also the ambulance driver is a ♥♥♥♥ing moron. 0/5 would not play again
