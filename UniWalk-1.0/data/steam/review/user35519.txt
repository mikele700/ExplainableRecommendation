Love the dishonored games and this DLC pack just added to the game andmade it a bit better than it already is,In the pack you get 3 very useful runes and some books to ready that add to the storys lines already amazing story and as a added treat you get 500 coins to spend on what eveer you want in the game.Overall i think that the pack is wirths its money and just adds to the already amazing story line9/10
one of the BEST dlcs you can buy #nukes
dishonored one of my all time games to play, the game is fun and it never gets repetive, you can go back when you want to make better choices in the game and every choice you make will impac the game some how
I would recommend this game to people who like sifi or stealth games.Its like Halo and Assasins creed had a childanyone would have fun with this game and everything is free
