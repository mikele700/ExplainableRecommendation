This game, man, THIS game... is REALLY good! The only problem I have with -the game- is that my computer sucks! But if I had a good one, I would play this game even more!
it's great! thanks valve for making the sequel, great new features, even though i'm writing this 4 years after. still! it holds up!
for some reason when i launch it it loads then a white screen comes up and i can't do anything except open task manager and close it i Do recommend it as i have it on my xbox and it is very fun indeed
