very good game, for what can be achived when you are giving goverment grants to help developers fully realise they have amazing skill and potental to create a visually impressive game. while not the cream of the crop of tower defence games it's pretty damn close for what it is and there is quite an amount of detail which feels alot more plolidhed than alot of other games. you can tell they put quite alot of love and houmor into it and for that I think it's work giving a bash if you injoy tower defence games.
