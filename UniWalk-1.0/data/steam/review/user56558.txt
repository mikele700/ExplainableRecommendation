I like this game alot, but thats not all! here, have a baking recipe for fried chicken(for those who are smart enough to realise i said -bake- instead of -cook-. Congratulations)Ingredients3 eggs1/3 cup waterAbout 1 cup hot red pepper sauce (recommended: Texas Pete)2 cups self-rising flour1 teaspoon pepperHouse seasoning, recipe follows1 (1 to 2 1/2-pound) chicken, cut into piecesOil, for frying, preferably peanut oilHouse Seasoning:1 cup salt1/4 cup black pepper1/4 cup garlic powderADD CHECKED ITEMS TO GROCERY LISTDirectionsIn a medium size bowl, beat the eggs with the water. Add enough hot sauce so the egg mixture is bright orange. In another bowl, combine the flour and pepper. Season the chicken with the house seasoning. Dip the seasoned chicken in the egg, and then coat well in the flour mixture.Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a deep pot. Do not fill the pot more than 1/2 full with oil.Fry the chicken in the oil until brown and crisp. Dark meat takes longer than white meat. It should take dark meat about 13 to 14 minutes, white meat around 8 to 10 minutes.House Seasoning:Mix ingredients together and store in an airtight container for up to 6 months.got this recipe from: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/southern-fried-chicken-recipe.htmlEnjoy
