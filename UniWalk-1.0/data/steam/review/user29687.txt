If you-'re playing in Southeast Asia, don-'t do it. Matchmaking will pair you up with Extremely professional non-english speaking feeders, and it-'s going to be scrub stacks everyday. The team who wins simply has more pub stacks and doesn-'t instapick Invoker. You-'ll get one good game out of maybe twenty, so unless you are willing to rage the other nineteen times, don-'t do it. Since Dota 2-'s all about teamwork, you will literally get cancer after watching your teammates play, and there goes an hour of your life. And when you-'re not losing due to crap teammates, you-'re stomping crap enemies, and your fun level will be as fun as bullying a child. Don-'t suffer like I did, go play LoL, because its the most fun thing on Earth, and you won-'t ruin the average Dota player-'s day by being -that- guy. Go on, you know you want to.
