Game is ok, but I wish it had more to offer. The time it takes to build stations and trade restrictions don't allow for much free play beyond the main quest line. Plus, dogfighting becomes repetative.
Absolutly brilliant game. But much too confusing for me.
Another repetiative hack&slash. If thats what you want thats what you'll get.
Great game, controls once familiar with are good. The machanics and storyline are well thought out. However without dlc the main quest line is quite short and the side quests are repetative. In saying that I'm still glad I paid for this game. Worth.
