Yes this game is amazing. I have 900+ hours on it, the most I have on a game I might add. I enjoy playing this with friends. Garry's mod comes with heaps of gamemodes in store like Trouble in Terrorist Town, Dark Roleplay, Death Run and Much much more. This game at the moment is $2.49 (when this was posted) the best price for any game. I suggest you buy this game.
Really great game, Awesome now that it has custom skins, made the game have an economy to it self. The game is really worth the $15 USD. If you are a fan of 1.6 or Source I have a big thought in my mind that you will enjoi Counter Strike : Global Offensive.
