Save MR.HATTY and stuff also cats are dangerous, don't let them lick you.
Still no Australian Server, unless you like being called an Indo lagger and enjoy hitting invisible enemies, You'll have fun with this game.
This game man.....Gameplay, Music, Characters, Story, it's unbelievably amazing, I wasn't expecting this at all, a lot of the songs were built up on hype when facing someone which made it incredible, best skeleton bros you'll ever have, the battles are all unique and unexpected.Best damn Spaghetti you will cherish.
