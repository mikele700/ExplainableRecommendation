Dirty Bomb is a class-based arena (style) shooter.In Dirty Bomb one team must either destroy an objective, repair an objective, or move an objective from point A to B; where the other team will try to stop it.All Mercs (characters) have different types of equipment: some can heal, drop ammo packs, call in airstrikes, etc.Loadouts are cards, you receive cards from either getting them dropped at the end of a game, or buying them for 1,000 ingame credits (about 2 matches worth of credits). Cards have different rarities, the rarer, the more perks you have.Higher rarity also changes the cosmetics of your character, ie: different camo on clothing and weapons.Cards can be traded up for several cards of the same rarity plus a small amount of credits.Each character has 3 different primary and secondary and knives which you might get.Each character has different roles because of their weapons and equipment, and a different card (loadout) may change your playstyle because of the weapons or perks, etc.There are 2 mercs which are permanently unlocked, and some mercs you can play as or a limited time because of free-rotation, which cycles mercs every few weeks. You can permanently unlock Mercs with either ingame credits, or cash.This certainly isn-'t pay2win, because if you buy a merc, other people may be able to use it in a few weeks.It only takes about 6-10 hours of playtime to be able to afford a merc with ingame cash anyway.You can aim down sights, but it is not reccomended as there is nearly no (extreme) recoil, and it slows you down.Time to kill in this game is considerably long if you go for body shots, which is why headshots are always reccommended, as it-'s only 2-3 shots with an AR.Pros and Cons.Pros:-Attractive visuals-F2P, but buying things with cash does not give an unfair advantage-Accessible game with a high skill ceiling, easy to learn but hard to master-Free rotation mixes up gameplay-The game has -under level 5- servers for people new to the game-You-'re able to walljump twice and keep momentum, making awesome trick jumps and skill based movement possible-Gun play is great-Hitboxes seem fineNegatives:-Some maps and classes need tweaking, ie: longer cooldown for airstrikes-Lack of gamemodes and maps-The game requires a lot of communication and team work for your team to be successful.
Pros-Fun combat-Different clasees and weapons can completely change the playstyle-Wide variety of period weapons, including: Generic swords (short sword, broad sword, etc), Spear, Claymore, Billhook, Zweihander, Axes, Maces, Morning star.-Sharp learning curve-Easy to grasp, but hard to master combat-Nice maps and graphics-Plenty of blood and gore, including decapitations-Servers that only new players (<level 15) can join to learn the game before joining regular servers with more skilled players-Objective modes are fun and challenging, Push the cart, Destroy X, Kill the King, etc-You have a warcry button to scream while charging into battle-Polished game-Cheap on sale, 2.49 USDCons-Some weapons need minor changes to balance them
Pros-Beautiful graphics-Large map-Really fun with friends or just other players-Difficult but fun and rewarding gameplay-Regular updates-Good building and resource mechanics-Good crafting systemCons-Horrible memory leak, my Fps starts at about 90 when I first start playing and after a few hours I can start going as low as 20 FPS-Can sometimes have trouble joining Co-op games-Annoying glitches, bonfires become unlightable-Hard to remove buildings after they've been constructed-Hard to lineup and make level and square buildings with custom foundations, floor, walls, etc-Hackers will often join your games and spawn hundreds of logs or other items, as there is no VAC and/or 3rd party anticheat-Some caves are nearly empty and feature no loot other than food

Great game - New gamemodes all the time. You can spend the better half of a day playing this game easily.DarkRP is probably my favorite gamemode.I'd give this gaym - 11/10 Minging Squeakers
This game would be fun it wasn't ♥♥♥♥ing optimised worse that a bag of hot steaming ♥♥♥♥.This game (by def) is capped at 30fps, and ported straight from console, almost no adjustments made.Yes DSfix can make the games playability levels a bit higher but it's still ♥♥♥♥ing laggy as all hell.I don't know which game had a worse port - Dark Souls, or Resident Evil 4, Res Evil 4 had absolutely no controls listed as it was ported straight over though, meaning you have to google search to actually play the game, the good thing is though the game has an FPS higher than 9.Would definetly not reccomend, not unless you have an extremelly high-end computer.
Excellent for a F2P (assuming you already own a game running on the source-engine)The maps are dark, gloomy and scary at points, if you're on your ownRight now, no guns seem massively-OP, meaning a more balanced game.The game is made tricky by how hindered you are when you run out of stamina (from sprinting/jumping etc.) But overall, the movement is fairly slow, so as you can't just rush through levels.
