I may have accidentally stuffed up a few times, but its great! Try not to die!
Its fun to play around with creating sims! Its always fun to play with (and torture) your sims!
So cute! ^.^
Though it often gets a bit irritating, its a great game! Itf fun as it develops your reaction time, and the soundtrack is just amazing!
Its a basic Music game like Tap Tap, but the visuals in this are amazing, AND you can import your own songs!
Terraria is an awesome Mineraft like game, But 2D. But in 2 words: ITS AWESOME
