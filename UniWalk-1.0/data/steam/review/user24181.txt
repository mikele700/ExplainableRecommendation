DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEIt is still in Alpha stages and nothing is even close to being finished. It has had yet another price bump making it even more overpriced. 75% of this game is walking around trying to find a town or something, 24% of the game is looking in the towns or whatever for items, and 1% of the game is fighting zombies, in which case if you don't have a gun and ammo (which is usually extremely hard to find), you may be able to kill it, but it will leave you bleeding and you will eventually die from blood loss. And when fighting the zombies, especially with melee, it is extremely glitchy and hard to kill them.
Was in a que to find a casual match for about 30 minutes and didn't find a game. Once I gave up on that I decided to play the solo mode which was absolute ♥♥♥♥. Don't bother downloading this game it is terrible.
♥♥♥♥♥est game. Will make you want to kill yourself. 10/10
Maybe the best game i have ever played. Definitley the best RPG i have ever played.
