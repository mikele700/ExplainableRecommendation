FTL is a game where the entire galaxy is layed out in front of you where you will be running and fighting the rebel fleet and other various enemy types also this game is brutal cause once you die thats it you have to start again so that raises the stakes and rewards you even more when you do well and there are a variety of mods available and ships ranging from stealth ships and mods include star trek and another hit series joss whedon's firefly. Overall this game is truly spectacular even with the simple graphics i give it 9.5 aliens on a ship
now your gonna have alot of fun when your breaking into a bank with your friends. this game is alot of fun and the missions are very lengthy but theres only a few of them but that isnt to bad considering the missions take about 30-45mins to complete but overall me and sirsonic11 have been having a blast with this one so im going to give a badass score of 8.7 money bags out of 10
now i could say bad or good things about this game but i shall say both. this game is like battlefield 3 and its squad basedd gameplay is really fun vehicles are excellent sci fi but the cintrols for them arent friendly to new comers but in the end i give this game a good enough score of 7.8
