An epic game! Delivers for both South Park fans and Gamers. The combat was suprisingly smooth and the open world is fun. The campaign was a bit short though, hopefully we will get more in the DLCs. 9/10.
Where to start, Garry's Mod isn't a game, it's anything you want it to be! FPS, Horror, Simulation, Building, Racing, Rocketing and more. Take your favourite Valve characters and put them all in a blender, the only limits are your imagination and amount of internet data avaliable to download ALL THE ADDONS! Get this game, you will not regret it! 1 simple payment of $10= 1 lifetime of fun!!! So yeh...Garry is watching!!!!
If you're a Star Wars fan, Get this game. If your an FPS/general shooter fan, Get this game, and if you are a PC gamer GET THIS GAME!!!
An amazingly fun shooter that involes more strategy than most FPS's. Highly Addictive, A MUST PLAY!!!
