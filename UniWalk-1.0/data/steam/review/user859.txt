This is a great action packed game with great graphics!  It has three game modes including single and co op campaign with 6 different races. The campaign can be set on easy, normal, hard and very hard.  The second game mode is multiplayer. You can also choose of 6 different races and their costume colors. You can do many different things on multiplayer, for e.g: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 etc. But my personal favourite is Last Stand. You can choose out of 6 races (or 7 if you have dlc) and can the play on two different maps. You play with three different people and as you gain more experience you can make your character stronger by giving him armor, weapons, and traits and abilities. You should seriously think about getting this game!
