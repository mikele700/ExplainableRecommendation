japanese game that you wont get called a weaboo for playing. 10/10In all seriousness though, the game is great, combat is smooth, pretty easy to pick up and within 5 matches i had gained enough currency to permanently purchase 2 players, on top of the one you are given for free, also, for the first 2 weeks of playing, you get access to everything for free. Theres a microtransaction currency but it can only be used for cosmetics or to unlock the same suits everyone else gets slightly quicker.This game is far from pay 2 win and just feels great to play in general.
