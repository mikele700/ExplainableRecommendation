Morrowind is almost 12 years old, the graphics are crap for todays standards and the combat mechanics are questionable, but this is my favourite TES game at this present time. The game is alot more unforgiving then the newer titles. You actually have to pay attention to the quest givers and random npc's to find the places you need to go.. It's exciting getting lost! The weapon variety puts Skyrim to shame, Proper katana's, crossbows, Tantos, spears, clubs and the infamous crescent moon! Aswell as the spell variety! Although the game is short, it is well worth the time and money to play this game!
