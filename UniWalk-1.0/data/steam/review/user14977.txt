I loved this game. However I cannot recommend this game after the most recent update. TF2 was the game where you just jumped in and mucked around. You looked up the servers you wanted to play on and jumped in and out at your leisure. Their latest update has killed aspects of the game that I loved.Valve removed all of their servers from the browser. They had the best servers. You could vote for the next map, kick tossers and hackers. Now you are left with community servers. There are some out there that are good, but are prone to advertising, plugins and admin abuse.Hacker's delight. Pray to Gaben that you don't end up with a hacker in casual play. In my last game, the opposing team had a blatant hacker. I don't call people out for hacking at a whim and even his own team acknowledged it. However, in the new 'casual' mode there is no way to remove these players from the game. You can't vote kick them off. If you leave you get penalized for abandoning the game - which is ludicrous. Who the hell thought this was a good idea? You assume the recovery position, suck your thumb and wait for the round to end. Then wait for the next VAC ban wave.. and hope it's soon.Casual play - randomness. You can't choose what game type you want. You can minimise the randomness by clicking a few buttons and then hope for the best. If you're proficient at multiple maps then great. If not. There isn't a way to choose specific maps or guaranteed a game type.Word is some of these things will be fixed. Doesn't seem likely they'll return the Valve servers to the browser. Real shame that :(
