Best MMOFPS I ever played, great game with a few drawbacks.Pros- great game mechanics- beautiful scenery- equipment & weps customisation - many more...Cons- SEA Servers plsssssssss- required microtransaction in order to be someone... if not be patient and slowly collecting certs....--- require some beefy pc
