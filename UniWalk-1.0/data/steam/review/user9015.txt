This game has so many guns that the NRA will be proud
[Barter 100/100] You will buy this game.
I was America and I dropped a nuclear bomb on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki 10/10 will reenact past events
Troy Baker goes yet again on another adventure this time, but instead of escorting a teenage girl through a hellish USA ravaged by some deadly fungus stuff  or aiding himself along with a legendary soldier, he goes to a flying steampunk city that any white American supremacist would call paradise. Then on, he has to find a girl and escort her to safety while fighting against the entire city and the inhabitants that want to kill him. 10/10 will fail to write good review.
The only percentage that matters is how much this game is going on sale for.
