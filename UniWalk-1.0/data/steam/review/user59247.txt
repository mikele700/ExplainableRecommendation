Tom Clancy's: The Division Agent Origins Escape was really a wonderful cinematic scene It really did match to the game, The Story , Cooperation, and The Shooting Scene was really Amazing to be honest I really love this short cinematic scene.So I was wondering If you guys will make more parts of Tom Clancy's: The Division Agent Origins we would gladly apperciate so I will try to recommend and share this to other people so keep it up.
Warface is a fast paced gameplay and awesome violence. If you're playing this game you need to think fast for a strategy, shoot the enemies fast, and run quick towards the objective to beat the enemy. Each class has their own role such as the Rifleman gives ammo to his/her teammates. The Sniper / Marksman his/her role is to eliminate futher threats to support teammates to move forward also they can also kill and scout enemies from a distance. If you're using the Sniper class you'd better be patient and suffiecient. The 3rd class is the Medic now this is the important class this is between your life or death because he/she gives you med packs also when you die the medic will revive with a defibrillator so you'd better be fast to help and heal your team or they'd die. Last class that'd be the Engineer he/she is capable of repairing you're vest/armor to absorb less damage but it takes a few seconds to repair itand the best part you can arm/plant a bomb did you know you can defuse it. Now really what I've expected from the Engineer class in warface was to build traps , turrets and explosives and to plant them anywhere able to plant them. now the coolest part was shooting while sliding to kill the hostile/enemy did ya know when u come across the hardest obstacle make sure you can help them climb up or help u climb up to move on. If my review helped you can like or reply me to thank me, If not that's ok I'm not really good makin reviews its my first time anyways. Well God Bless Everyone!
