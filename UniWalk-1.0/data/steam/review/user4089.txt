Classic 40k bloodyness with a good single player campain can't really recommed the muiplayer feels like it was tact on
Even though the gameplay isn't the best it is still very good
Wtf am i doing with my life?
Now i gota say this no matter how many people say how much more bad this game-'s communty has gotten over the yearsI see that people are consistenly saying -russians are fagots hackers everywhere and so on and so forth-I have yet to see a russian this year but I saw ONE last year. ONEWant to know why cause I don-'t live in US or russia. I live in austraila and almost everyone i-'ve been matched with has been pretty cool so if you live in australia pick it up
Gameplay is fluid and and this game looks amzing plus it has a wonderful story
