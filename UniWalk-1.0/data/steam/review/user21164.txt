Absolutely brilliant. Best thing I've played since Human Revolution. Hilarious and endlessly fun. Unfortunate lack of customisation, but that would be my only critisicm. It would be a shame if Blood Dragon didn't begin it's own franchise. I for one would buy anything, so long as Rex was in it again.
