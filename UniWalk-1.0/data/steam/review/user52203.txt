This is game is really fun to play with friends and has a very good community. This game is recommended for those WWII lovers and just fps gamers in general. Great graphics and smooth gameplay.
This is by far the best Free-To-Play game i have played in years. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Battlefield or any free-roam fps games. This is a must get MMO.
