In most aspects this game is on par with most other games, its performance and learning curve might be a bit lacking but it has something that almost no other FPS has to this degree. Scale.it is like if you took Halo and all of its multiplayer maps and stitched them together, tacking blood gulch onto valhalla onto another 30 maps gives you one of the four continents of Auraxis and having upwards of 200 players fighting in a single location in three seperate factions this game is immense.
