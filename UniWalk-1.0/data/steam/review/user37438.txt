This is a reccomendation, but i have to say no because all the factions are locked without mods and even then 6 are locked until you buy the dlc and there isn't any gore without dlc. WHY!?!??!?!!??! But i havenm't played many civ like turn based strategies and i like this one... with mods of course.
This game is one of the best games ever made. It has brilliant graphics, Great mechanics and even an amazing singleplayer story campaign. WAIT ♥♥♥♥! I CLICKED ON BAD RATS! ♥♥♥♥! DELETE! DELETE! DELETE!
First, the kid was interested, snooping around a broken, if beautiful, world. Then the kid got bored senselessly  bashing monsters. Kid thought about giving up, going to sleep, eating something. Then the kid met Zia. Been hooked ever since. Can-'t stop singing its praise. Some people disagree with his opinion, saying he-'s an idiot. Kid don-'t care. -I-'ll dig my hole you build a wall!- he shouts -Some day that wall is gonna fall!- People say he-'s crazy. I say he-'s coming home.
