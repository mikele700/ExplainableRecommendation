One of the most fun games I've played, it's good if you want a quick game to play, and or something fun with friends.
This game is a very story driven game. You will not like this game if you are inpatient or like action, but what this game does have is a very good story, many nods to your child hood if you grew up in the 90s, and the atmosphere is the best I have ever felt in a game, it is very very spooky, but then brightens the moods. You never know whether or not to keep on your guard, or just enjoy the story being narrated from picking up an item of interest of your sisters child hood. Love this game, and I've only played 33 minutes of it.
This game has 0 ways of being boring, it is my favourite game, and yet it is so basic, but can be used to make anything in your imagination. 435 hours played. 0 seconds of regret
This game is seriously limitless, I have played skyrim on PC & PS3 for the last 3 - 4 years, and have not done everything in it yet.
An amazing game in alpha alone, if you like survival, crafting, and scary games, get this game there will  be no regrets!
