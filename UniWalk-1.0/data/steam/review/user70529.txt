If u like hardcore minecraft this is the game for you. Much more immersive then minecraft in minecraft there is no exploration purposes but in terraria u can find special statue's gems like diamonds ruby's ect. Far more ore's and minerals and its actually graduately harder then minecraft. The game can either like you or hate u with a wide veriety of monster's and bosses more then minecraft that has only 2. The point here is that even if u like minecraft this game can make it worth your while
