You start playing and you suck its alright cause you know one day you will get good. You decide that to get better you need to watch some youtube videos so you end up at the Warowl's youtube chanel after 7 years of grinding death match you reach rank 3 and start playing competative you get to meet people who are bad just like you but wait one guy on the other team is destroying you. The score is 0-10 and the game looks to be over the guy destroying your team admits to being a smurf and he swiftly ends the game how embarasing. After a few games of this you start to see these skins that you like so you look at purchasing these skins you look at purchasing a knife but they are $250 you think thats alot for some pixels so you turn to the cases to try and unbox that knife you buy 10 keys and start unboxing but you dont seem to be lucky after finally grinding your 10 competative wins you make it to silver 2 and you think im gonna be the greatest player of all time. 1 year down the track you now lost everyone you ever loved but who needs them when you have skins now you are losing all your games to hackers so you resort to smurfing so you can make fun of people that you were like once.
