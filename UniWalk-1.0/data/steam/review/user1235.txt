HORRIBLE GAME, DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU DO GET A REFUND, poor graphics, bad UI, if you want a space game based on minecraft get space engineers, player models are ... well Cr*p also controls are pretty iffy and sound is horrible DO NOT PURCHASE sorry developer but i did not enjoy those 6 minutes of play time one bit
Very Good
