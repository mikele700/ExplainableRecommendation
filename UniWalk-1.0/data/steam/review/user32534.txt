Best game ever. Hard to start from 0-0 but you get there. DLC's are really up to you but the gage dlcs are recommended(just to have more weapon choices). I believe that the microtransactions and the safes are being overreacted to. You can always choose to get the skins, or, you can choose not to. The skins itself aren't great and the nice people down at LastBullet have way better mods for weapons (not sponsored). The stat increases are really dumb in theory and in practice, but only stability and concealment are affected. Overall, this is a game that was good when it came out, better with the addition of useful DLC's like Gage Weapons Pack 1 2 and 3, and has begun to fall given the surge of fun but a bit impractical DLCs like Wild West, BBQ and Chivalry. And oh god the Character Packs! It is not worth it to get them all, I got Dragan because I love the Lion's Roar, is complete beast, and Sokol for Grinder. As I type this the damn 5GB update is still downloading. Prepare your anuses for many more huge updates to come. Happy Crimefest 2k15 and lets hope OVERKILL starts to stop being moneygrubbing SOBs.
