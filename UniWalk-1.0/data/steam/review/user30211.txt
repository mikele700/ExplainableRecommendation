Added an Australian character, something seldom seen in games. Gotta love being noticed once in a while.Also the game is an amazing gore-fest for any shooter fans that want to dismember things.But mainly the aussie love.
This game is too ridiculously cute. I'm more into bloody, gory games and I'm averse to anime, but, dang does this make me happy to play.
Developers stand by artistic integrity, aren-'t afraid to pursue -controversial- matters for the sake of their ideals, and the game is just flat out awesome besides. A free game better than many Pay to play titles, very commendable.Support those who don-'t crumble to petty demands.
This is the definitive pack for you to get, if you wish to both support the developers, and get an overdose of gems at less than half of the normal price. The added benefits really flesh out the experience (especially if you-'re into aesthetics) and give you a bounty of goodies.Its also a really decent price for a -free to play-. After buying this you felt like you bought everything you needed.
