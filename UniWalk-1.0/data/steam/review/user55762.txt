So there i was. Fochi 2014 slopestyle. through sweaty fingers, a grimace of pain and a 78th attempt, i was finally flying gracefully off the last hump, tailgrabbing and crossing skis like an eagle. As i landed the almost impossible crossed ski double-rotation tailgrab, i couldnt help feeling like i had just nailed the unnailable.then i was rocket-blasted of my skis and sent sailing over a stunned crowd, coming to a halt with a broken neck and dislocated limbs as i smacked face-first into the cold, unforgiving ground.and every second was beautiful.Every. Seconddo your self a favour and come break your limbs with all of us, for the special introductory price of $10!Snow. Where people break bones. Together.

This is the bast game of 2016.not even so far.if a game tries to be better, pony island will trap it and put it through the same literal hell it put me,If you want a nightmare, eat a bag of butter fingers before you go to sleep.If you want a REAL nightmare, then shut up and give steam your wallet.Because this 5 dollars will not get you a game about ponies.It well get you a right good head-♥♥♥♥.so how 'bout it?ready for a good non-pony related experience?Just hit that start button.your 'game' will begin now.Have fun...
