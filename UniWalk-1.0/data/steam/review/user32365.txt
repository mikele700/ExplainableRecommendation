Civilians in this game have suffered enough brain damage to not understand how to walk in a straight line while be threatened with guns yet still being worth $20,000 for every one that dies.Play the game though. Masks are cool. I like Majora's Mask.
10/10 would break my leg from walking on a twig again.
Start building crap like -work peasants-Get to the first winter and be like -dafq why you all dying it-'s only -20 degrees-11/10 much realism in the face of no firewood or warm clothing. Build a tailor.
