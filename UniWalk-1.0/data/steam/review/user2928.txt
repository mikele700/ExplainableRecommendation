Everything wants to kill you or destroy your home.10/10 Australia Simulator. Would die again.
Mountain is a dollar well spent. For those saying its just a glorified screensaver, to each their own. But make no mistake, there is actually quite a bit to do in Mountain.Looking out on the abyss in which your mountain floats is serene. Sometimes, terrifying, if your annihiliation is slowly flying towards you. Yes, it's not as flashy as COD, but I would take this over COD anyday. Just the quiet ambience, and the occasional lone, melancholy note signalling that your Mountain, this huge, hulking Mountain, has thought of something. Sometimes it reflects on the weather. Other times he expresses sadness and memories long forgotten. Controls-wise. Well, the music you can play. You can activate raging firestorms, fish, frogs, hearts, coins, or even blood. It all comes raining down upon your Mountain in a way that can be truly terrifying, engaging, or beautiful. Every now and again, your Mountain experiences a bit of cold weather, and snow comes down upon it, coating your little objects in white fluff. You can zoom in to examine these objects, these stray pieces of someone's or something's life, that come crashing into your Mountain from the cosmos. You can then move these objects, or feel joy/sadness as you purposefully/accidentally send them hurtling back into the void. You can express your distaste at clouds by waving your mouse wildly in defiance.The game is meant to be played when you want. I recommend checking up on it occasionally, but not actively playing if you don't feel like it. Check back if you hear the telltale ping of the Mountain's thoughts.The Mountain is thinking. The Mountain is waiting.
