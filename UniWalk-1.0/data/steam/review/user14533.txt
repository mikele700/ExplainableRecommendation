Played for 200+ hours, while I can say the gameplay is fun and to climb a ladder requires skill. The casual games modes are fun, but the competitive ranking system is now awful, you can top frag for 5 games in a row and go unbeaten for 10 or so games and still derank on the first loss.The game is good for what it is, a cheap FPS.
