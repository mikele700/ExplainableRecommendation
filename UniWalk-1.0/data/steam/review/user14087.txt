Its a great game (Once you get used to it) like certian apocalypse games you usualy don't have a crosshair which makes it feel more realistic, the thing i really like about it is  that their is GORE!!! I like in games seeing peoples heads exploding MMMMMMMMMM! (Okay i'm going to end this because its getting a bit insane.)
