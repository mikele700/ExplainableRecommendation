I can deal with bugs, weird 3D and terrible camera angles but what I'm upset about is the absolutely poor excuse for a campaign. I finished this game in 4 hours and get almost every signle triangle. I spent 28 hours easily in Trine 2. A game this short is in no way worth $20.
This game has some of the worst controls and mechanics that I've ever seen. Takes 90% of the fun out of it.
