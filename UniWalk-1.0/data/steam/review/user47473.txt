Very good game infact for a while there it was one of the only games i played, I love it and think that there are obvious room for improvement (which may or may not have been fixed in Rugby Challenge 2 but im not sure) but all in all it really is a good game. Controls are easy to get used to and the difficulties are great for inexperienced players and experienced players all the same.
Great game, havent played many hours yet but can already tell i will be spending alot of time with talion...
