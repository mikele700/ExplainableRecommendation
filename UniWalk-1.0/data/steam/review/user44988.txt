So im sitting here on a lazy sunday night, and my friends are encouraging me to download this game. i know literally nothing about this game, except it is similar to castle crashers, apparently. i kinda can't be bothered downloading this, but peer pressure really sucks. so im gonna get this game, and i'll get back to you guys some time soon with the proper review of the game.
