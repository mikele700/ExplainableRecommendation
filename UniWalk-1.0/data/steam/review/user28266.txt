yeah the story ain't so great but who are we kidding.
There isn't even zombies this patch. ?!???/??!!??!?!??! Kind of funny though, a zombie survival game with no zombies...
Just buy it.
nekopara volume 2, rhymes with kill me.
Bioshock invites to an interesting enviroment with very detailed characters and events. Even though its currently 7 years old its still a must buy.
Good game very good.
