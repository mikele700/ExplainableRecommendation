First video game I've ever played that has made me cry. 10/10
They took a step forward, bringing in better optimisation for lower and higher end builds, a graphical overhaul, and a new and powerfully immersive ui, but they took a step back from the mod by removing all shotguns, all but one assualt rifle, all snipers rifles and all but one pistol. I know its an alpher but seriously? Removing key weapons that made the mod so unique essentially takes this game a step back in time. Don't even bother playing with friends who have just bought the game btw. Since the game doesn't tell you where you spawn, it can take you literally 30+ minutes to meet up with said friends. This game is not worth $30 and it feels like they took a step forward, an then half a step backwards. Alpha stage of the game feels rushed to meet the pre-christmas deadline. 6/10 get rust instead/.
