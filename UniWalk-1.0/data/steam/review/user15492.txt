I have not enjoyed a platformer game in ♥♥♥♥ing years. This game is perfect in every way. I'll nearly have beaten it tonight :3 can't wait!
If I start up Tree of Savior, it opens a window and downloads some stuff for lack of a better word. When it does this, it literally breaks my internet while doing so. It shows my steam connection as offline it disconnects me from battle.net if I try to open a webpage it acts as if my internet has gone down. This is a pretty insane bug for a simple window downloading more stuff for the game.
