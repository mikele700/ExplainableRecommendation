Playdead's INSIDE is honestly the most overwhelming game.  I would suggest not reading any reviews and get the game right now. Trust me, it's worth it.  The game takes in the style of LIMBO, a somewhat older playdead game.  The story takes the player on a journey in which captivates their mind.  The graphics are astoundingly amazing, so much that will make you stop to take in the artistic structures and settings.  The gameplay is also amazing, with the way that you will never get bored and be in awe the whole time.  I guarantee you will get emotionally attached to this game is someway shape or form.  Get it.
Dark souls 2 SOTFS is an even better version of the original Dark Souls 2.  It is a game where you need to invest time into, but you won-'t get bored.  There is always something to do and something to scream at when the words -YOU DIED- pop up when you-'re about to do something exhilarating. With every boss comes a lot of heart pumping adrenalin when you-'re sitting on you-'re chair getting ready to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of again.10/10 would praise the sun again
