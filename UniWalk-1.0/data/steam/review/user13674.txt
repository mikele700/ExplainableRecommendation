Very good combat system, something nothing else is really offering to poeple. There pay to play people and items but those items can also be earned permenantly through hard work whilst paying for them is a limited time offer, of normally 30 day's. I recommend this game to people that are looking for a very nice feel, game that can spend time to appreciate it and doesn't get caught up on the little negatives that all games have.:)
