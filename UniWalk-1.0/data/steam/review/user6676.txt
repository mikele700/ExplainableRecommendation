Coming up on 530 hours on this game, every one of which was filled with total 'gory' (Is that the right word? :D) awesomeness. I am no-where near getting bored of this game-The game does, I admit, have a steep lurning curve which was one of the factors which turned away potential buyers. However TornBanner remedied this and added new player servers for those who are new to the game and need a little practice before going against players who swing as fast as superman.-There are plenty of servers, and cover most regions of the world.-The combat is fast paced, addictive and mucho pleasurable -Awesome character creation-There is no 'pay to win'-Many different game modes- community made maps and modes are common place-Community is active and friendlyOverall this is a truely awesome game and you should definantly snap it up while its at this price
Underwhelming. Why Bethesda.. I'm lost
Its 40k.
Amazing. If you love Game of Thrones you will love this game 10/10
