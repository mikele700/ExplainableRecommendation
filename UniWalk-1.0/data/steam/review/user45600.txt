Awesome game highly recomend. FPS of the future, competitive with plenty of space for stragegy or if you prefer casual play it has 100's of servers (oceana).
I absolutly love this game highly recomend I got on sale and WELL worth it. It isn't the longest game but with comunity made levels this game will keep you procrasternating for hours on end. Love it would give 2 thumbs up if  could.
