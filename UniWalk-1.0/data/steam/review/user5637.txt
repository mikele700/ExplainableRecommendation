This game is sort of like sanctum but in third person mode and you can collect better Weapons and armour. Sometimes this game can be addicting.
11/10 cant get passed 1st level. it is very very challenging
bought it for a dollar at Ebgames Australia lol
addicting as ♥♥♥♥
i'd strongly recommend this game 8/10Note: buy the game now b4 the multiplayer comes out and it will be $20 :)
the whole game is awesome but 1 problem... bad voice acting
It's free for now..
