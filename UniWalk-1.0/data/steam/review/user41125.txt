I'm so confused... I actually had funI thought it was gonna be a soulless cash-in but I actually enjoyed it.. It's no Pac-Man World 2 but it's far from terrible
I just can't eventhere's no way I can take this seriouslyit's like I'm really in the 90s again
This game changed my life.No longer can I look at a horse - real or virtual - without thinking -Gee, I wish I could brush your hair in Secret of the Magic Crystals! It fills me with sadness when I realise that I will never be able to play training games involving tapping the arrow keys in time with the horse-'s movements with any of these other equines, care for them when they-'re sick, craft horseshoes from a variety of different metal types, create potions to improve their abilities, or send them to races and quests. And worst of all, they will never know the sheer joy I experience when I find any of the magic crystals scattered across the land.-'Secret of the magic crystals-' provides you with countless hours of entertainment and uncontrollable joy, however that will be replaced with deepest sadness once you realise you can-'t live these wonderful adventures in real life.10/10 would buy again, for me and all of my friends
