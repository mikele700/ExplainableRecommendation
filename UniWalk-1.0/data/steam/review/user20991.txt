Team Fortress 2 is not your typical first person shooter. Sure, you can shoot people, and blow them up but what sets this game apart from the typical FPS is it's creativity, this game is not logical, this game is not realistic but yet it does what it's meant to do so well. The game has nine classes to choose from (offensive, defensive and support) each with different roles, the scout for example must capture objectives and deal with his foes quickly while a heavy will draw attention and tank or a medic which will support objective based players or the tanky heavies. There are also more unorthadox classes like the Engineer which construct mechanical toys for their allies to use to their advantage. One of the more unique classes (the class everyone hates but everyone plays) is the spy, the spy can shapeshift into a member of the other team and sneak behind enemy lines and score an instakill backstab with their trusty knife, they can also turn invisible and disable engineer machines. The classes work in perfect harmony with each other with each class benifiting the team in a way. The game is free to play but by no stretch is it pay to win, everything you can pay for can be obtained by finding it in game or trading for it and the trading community is strong and well populated which makes it easy to trade. Skill is a more dominant factor as what use is the best gun in the game if a new player is using it? This is where lots of free to play games fail but this is where Team Fortress 2 stands out. To sum up TF2 is a great game that involves heavy use of teamwork and the best bit is it's free, you can obtain the best items in the game without paying a dime which makes me give this game a9/10
