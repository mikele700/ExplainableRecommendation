The next series in the wargame saga. i must say despite it's big talk it ain't as good as the 2 before. this game had lots of hype about it. yet i feel that it has been somewhat of a let down. besides the numerous issues i am having with this game i am still a fan of the wargame series. this game still is a must buy for the strategic person.
This game is a 8/10 for me. It has good concepts and mechanics as well as hours of fun. On top of the vinalla game are also the mods that you can get for it. This game has a huge modding community and is worth the price and time. The game has a easy to mild learning curve making great for players new to stratergy games or familiar with them.
I have played the civilization series since number 3 and i have to say this is the best out of the series. If you want simplicity and an easy learning curve this game is for you. it has a ton of features and the modding community can bring this game to a whole new level. Just watch out for ghandi ;)
a great sequal to a great series. definetly for the hardcore real time stratergist.
the best war based stratergy game i've played
