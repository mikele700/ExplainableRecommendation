i dunno how this game got greenlit bc its a piece of trash. my classmates can make better games than this.
Typically I don't like online multiplayer games, especially online FPS because they're all about winning and who can get the most kills - not that exciting. TF2 is different though -I absolutely love the characters, different classes, weapons, game mods, maps, hats and miscs, and the community. I'd recommend trying it, really addictive.
