I haven't been this invested in an MMO before. It's just perfect in every way, and I really love that you can unlock all jobs/classes on one single character. Love love love Final Fantasy lore and how they've put their own unqiue spin on the genre. There's also a friendly feeling to the game, allowing new players into the genre to be hand-held every step of the way :)
