I was excited about this game, as i have not seen a free 2 play basketball game on steam. i tried it and i did not get to play a single second because this game is a spectating simulator. it is absolutely terrible and the controls are crap, the movement is clunky and so are the character animations. -let me run over to the ball as it teleports into my hand-! the best part of this game was the uninstall function, 10/10 for that. as for the game -over9000/10.
