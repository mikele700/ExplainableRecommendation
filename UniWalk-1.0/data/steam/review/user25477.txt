I enjoy this game and i could literally spend hours on it. If you like 4X games, this one will become one of your favorites. 8/10
I'm a big fan of ships from this century and even in early access, the game has delivered what i expected. Theres definetly work to do but so far, its not bad.
I tried to give this game a chance. I had to look past the missing features, terrible fps and general negativity. The game was overhyped, I was excited at the fact that I could travel through space and visit -almost infinite worlds- but honestly it was just mine, mine, fuel up your ship and life support so you don-'t die and mine again. I-'ve learnt my lesson, never get overhyped or preorder games. I would not recommend this game if you expect to do a lot but if you-'re fine with exploring the same planets and mining, go ahead.
