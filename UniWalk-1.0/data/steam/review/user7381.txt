Robocraft is one of the new games on steam that seems to catch everyones eye. And in -'my-' eyes, they succeded in making it extraordinary. The style of the game is not overdone, and not too Clich√© as well. They have hit the bullseye in making a different game entirely!Many people look at the cover of the book and toss it away, saying -it-'s a copy of minecraft- or -the graphics are bad-, but when you give it a shot it really proves the cover responce wrong.On my first experience playing the game I-'ve noticed newcomers for the game will feel a little overwelmed at first. But until you get the hang of the game, it gets very enjoyable. Especially with a friend playing along side with you.the only negitave thing I myself can say about Robocraft is how new players in tier 1 can be put up aganst players who pay to get tier 4 weapons. Which i think is quite unfair. THe only thing I can point out to improve on is how they matchmake the players, the ranking strategy does not seem to work.Other than that I would give this game an overall score of 7.5 out of 10. Great game Freejam!
