What can i say about borderlands EPICCCCCCCCC!Seriously  if u have never played it grab the goty edition u will not be dissapointed
Borderlands 2 is an awesome addition to the borderlands games.  There is so much to do i highly reccomend getting the goty edition. Great value for money. Only downside is the dlc's are very short nothing like the borderlands 1.
Payday 2 i an improvement on the first but once u unlock all guns and masks getting to level 100 is just a grind
metro last light is an improvement on the first has an excellent story game play and graphics really good game highly reccomend
Awesome game definitely buy it as soon as u can well worth it and amazing graphics and gameplay if familar with bioshock 1 and 2
Awesome game but not like previous max payne games but relly good would recommend to anyone
Best fps Out There
