This game is still f*cking amazing till this day. I remember playing endless hours when I was a kid. As soon I booted it up again after 14 years I still get the nostalgic feeling when I hear the intro. It's just one of those games I would put so many hours into and still wouldn't get bored of it. It's definitely a must buy if you have never played GTA III before. Same goes for Vice City and San Andreas. Those three are forever the greatest of all time.
This is my all time favorite Saints Row game no doubt. But the game itself is unplayable, and a really bad PC port. So if you wanna reminisce old times I'd rather you get this on console than PC.
