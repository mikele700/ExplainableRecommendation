Most addicting tower defence. Lots to do and plenty of replayability, love it.
Best purchase I've made in a long time, was amazed at this game, it satisfied all my zombie needs from the exploring to the building of the community. Rarely I'm impressed with a game but this was amazing, I recommend this game to everyone
As an avid city builder fan, and also a fan of previous tropico games, Tropico 5 does not dissapoint me and has made some changes that makes the series so much better. I would have to say the trading system and the modernizing of the housing has been my most favourite changes of all.
