Warframe is a great game. They created a 3rd person shooter unlike any other. The amount of weapons, pets and warframes (suits) is fenomanel and you can get almost everything for free.So first I'll tell you the negatives. This is a game where you will need to hide behind cover but there is no proper cover system witch is a big problem. At first it may be hard to adjusting to having to crouch behind objects and move out of cover to shoot people but it is easy to get used too. The great thing is once your character ranks up a bit this becomes less and less of a problem.I would suggest playing this game while it's free because it's going to become a full game (is in beta at the moment) and so this may add a price tag. Premium is something that can really make things easier but i don't suggest getting it because buyihng stuff always seems to be a waste.The extensive amount of stuff is another thing. While there are about 14 warframes (suits) which are all completely different some a really overpowered and others underpowered, it doesn't work. The overpowered ones are hard to get and underpowered ones you start with (the best starting warframe is Loki btw) (second best is excalibre.I recommend buying blueprints for everything because their so much cheaper the only issue is you have to wait to build stuff and you have to collect items. Sentinels are really overpowered and bad for stealth (unless you get the one for stealth). They are basically pets and shoot enemies for you.All around this is an awesome game with great gameplay it just has a couple of flaws. If you have enough friends to play with it can be very addictive but if you don't have any friends that are interested don't bother playing it because this game is made for multiplayer.
