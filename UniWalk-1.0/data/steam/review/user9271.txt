Not the best of games. Its not terrible, but it is buggy and very unbalanced/Unforgiving at times.
This game is one of those games where, its serious, but isn't too serious. With all the weapons and hats, oh so many hats, It is a game that shouldn't be taken seriously. All of the gamemodes to date have been fun, even some of the community created gamemodes and co-inciding maps. To end it, Fun, wacky, and just a plain good time.
