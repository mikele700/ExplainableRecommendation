This is a -must own- in your library. But to play it without errors/missing textures/wireframe walls, windows etc. get C:SS.
This game is a nice fps but after you started trading TF2 is going to change for you. You might want to collect all the hats in the game but a month later 60 (maybe more) new items will get added into the game. And the result is: Gaben will eat your fresh dollars from your wallet.
