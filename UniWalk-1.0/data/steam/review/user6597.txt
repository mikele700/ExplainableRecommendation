this game is old, yet damn fliping brilliant.if a little slow and laggy on my computer, with long load timesstill fliping great game!
This game is what I HATE in racing games...you got to pay for PRETTY MUCH EVERY CAR....AND ONE STARTING TRACK!SO SH** MY OPINION
Game of dreams. I made a car more powerful than a veyron, with an engine half the size, and it's a hell load slower. I bought the game before it was on steam, and have loved it since I bought it.Now I just wait on the Tycoon. And Superchargers, don't forget Superchargers. Or V10s. And Boxers. Maybe Hybrid systems (Probably not)11/10
Yes I've only played 3.6 hours (At time of review) but holy hell...This game will change your perspective on everything.On my first attempt, I lost one of my characters. I paused the game and stood away from my computer for a good 5 mins, just thinking abou where I went wrong. 2nd attempt (Which is still going at time of review) and I made it to day 9 without anything going wrong, but then that night, I went a little bit too far. My main scavenger was raiding a house with people in it, and I was trying to sneak past, but then I was spotted. One of them had a shotgun, and shot my scav, seveirly wounding him. I hid him in the basement, and let him rest. He couldn't get out. Then the person with the Shotty came down the ladder, and I clobbered her with my hatchet. The other two in the house were un-armed, but I killed them anyway. By the time I had gotten the shotgun, it was 20mins till dawn, and I wasn't getting out in time. He had arrived home that afternoon, but was leathaly wounded and broken. I had one of my guys talk him back into life, and give him some canned food. But...I had no bandages, and didn't have the means to make any. For three nights, I went Searching places for bandages. Even went to the hospital, but they wouldn't help. That night, my main scavenger died from his wounds.I give this game a 9.5/10 on the feel raiting, and a 9/10 on the game itself.~Vri
