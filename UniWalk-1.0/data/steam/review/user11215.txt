ate berry...did poo...could pick up own poo...ate own poo...10/10
This game is hands down the best $6 i have ever spent, there is nothing more satsifying than finally creating a working catapult and destroying villagers. for a alpha game, the gameplay is polished and everything works.not much more to say, highly reccomend.
Almost 9 months, and still in early acess Alpha?..... Do not waste you time and hard earned money, this game is clearly in development hell, and it dosen't look to be leaving it any time soon.
