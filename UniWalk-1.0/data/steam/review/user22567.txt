Whatever you do, do not buy this game. I did. And after a few minutes of playing, I already realised that it was a terrible purchase. A complete waste of money. If only I hadn't stupidly purchased this, after hearing good reviews, I would have way more money for more important things.Like Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition. An extra $5  will get you over $30 worth of Downloadable content. Don't be a dumbass like me. Hurry up and purchase it, you cheap ♥♥♥.
