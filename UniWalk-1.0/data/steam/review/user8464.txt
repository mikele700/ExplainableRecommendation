I don't think I've ever felt so beautifully heartfelt as I did when I discovered just how beautiful this game is.Infinite space exploration and the ability to go at your own pace meant I could relax to this game into the early hours of the morning. Plus, the soundtrack made every minute worth playing.I've hit the point where I've done most of the stuff so far, and I'm eagerly awaiting to see what happens when this game comes out of early access.
