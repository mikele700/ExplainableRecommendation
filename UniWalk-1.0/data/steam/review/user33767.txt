After having a great experience with XCOM EU/EW, I was eager to get my hands on XCOM 2. I can gladly say that it is a great improvement over its predecessor. Besides a few graphical issues and fps drops, the game itself is fantastic. I have seen people review it badly because of those sole flaws, however, let me assure you that the gameplay, is XCOM refined to greatness. If you liked XCOM EU/EW, prepare to have your soul crushed and prepare for one of the most satisfying games of your life. You should definitely buy it.
I have had no issues with this game thus far. The framerate is steady dropping a frame here or there, but not much more than a frame. The gameplay is Souls, and I love the punishment it gives me. That last part might have sounded a bit kinky, and that's because it was. Anyway, if you have a computer that can handle it (and a controller) then this is definetly a must have game for people who want a challenge, or masochists like me. 10/Will troll summon people again.No really though, this is future Game of the Year. 10/10 Oscars of Astora ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)EDIT: I've had one crash after I killed the second boss
Lovely tactical combat.
Terraria is one of the best crafting games ever plus its cheap.
