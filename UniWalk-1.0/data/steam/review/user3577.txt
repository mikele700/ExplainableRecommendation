I love sending zombies sprawling from my laser minigun which I got from a martian saucer, which can only be fought after defeating the golem, who is the boss right after Plantera, who is a giant angry rose that will give you a staff to summon tikimen. These tikimen are really good for taking out the mechanical bosses, who are the bosses that spawn after the wall of flesh has been defeated. The only to summon the wall of flesh is by killing a voodoo demon and dropping the guide voodoo doll into the lava of the underworld, which is the deepest point of terraria, before going to the underworld you should take out all the prehard mode bosses.
