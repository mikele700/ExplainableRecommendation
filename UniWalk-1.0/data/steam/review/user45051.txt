Such an amazing game, has a compelling story, solid action, and the gameplay is overall fun! the game does lack in freedom though, it is quite linear, but it dosn't really bother you in forceful way. i would play the campagin again and again, even if it dosn't have choises you have to make to change your outcome at the end. 9/10
What is LIMBO about? I'ts... uh... hmm... It's what the discription says it's about, it's mearly about a boy who enters LIMBO, being uncertain of his sisters fate, and thats probably the only time you are going to get a description about what this game is about. Playing the game, all you know is that you are a boy going through this harsh and unforgiving forest, just moving right to your next obsticle. So simple, yet so perfercet for a game like this. You will get this simplicity going throughout the entire game, especially with your controls, with just up, down, left, right and Ctrl.bust dont fear for the game to be too simple, you will come across many gizmo's and obstacles that you need to use yor whits, some are dificult if your looking for a challenge, I admit I had to look up some gameplay for me to figure it out, (but that's just me, I kynda suck). The look of the game as beutiful as it is simple, just plain black and white, but it does not fail to amaze. This game is a truly unique experience, and I would highly reccomend it to any one.
