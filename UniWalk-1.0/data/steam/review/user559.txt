First Review
this is a great game that really made me think ( i tend to think too deeply about stuff tho) and even thought its me most moral based games result in me cutting up the -insert maids name here or bad choice option- but this made me really think and i loved all 27 min and 33 secands of it
one word -amazing-
behold THIS AMAZING demo of -what starforge could have actully have been- is just a tast of this product and only represents 0.0001 of the actural product promised you can either A leave with your money knowing RUN RUN RUN ITS A VAPAR WERE or buy it and then complaim to steam support taht you purchest this wondefull fine game and recieved the demo only to learn it was the full deal and that there is barely anygame to playcough warz cough cough
