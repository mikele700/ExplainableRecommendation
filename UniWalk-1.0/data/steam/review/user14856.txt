 Hearts of Iron III is a Grand-Strategy game based in WW2 to the start of the cold war, to be more specific, 1936 - 1948, it was developed & Published by Paradox Interactive and personally is a spectacular Grand-Strategy.Hearts of Iron III (HOI3) is an educational, engaging and in-depth experience, it allows you to micro-manage every aspect of your military (Army, Aviation & Navy), politics, industry, espionage and more, however if you do not wish to be engulfed with all of these aspects, the AI can take over for you.HOI3 allows for countless do-overs and often answers the -What if?- questions comically or quite grimly, it has countless events that allow you to make choices about your nation, such as limiting parties or getting completly rid of a party and other events such as illegal acts.HOI3 also allows you to invade other countries though your military, yes, but also through your diplomacy and espionage, do you want to stop Nazi Germany from getting far at all? Then send it spies to ruin their party and make other parties more strong, however good luck with that. :)If you wish to have a friend to play with, you-'re able to do that, however be aware that the servers are not up anymore and you will be forced to host your own server through port-fowarding or using a program such as Hamachi, playing online is very interesting and is often more difficult due to the AI sometimes being very predictable.The game does suffer from bugs, game crashes and HUD bugs are very common and get worse the longer you play for one session. If the game does not even launch, it is often Steam or your system and a reinstall is very handy. Game crashes seem to get worse the longer you use a constant game copy, reinstalling this game every time crashes become common is a good idea and modding the game can also cause crashes, however I would reccomend the WW1 mod.I full-heartly reccomend this amazing game, with over 600 hours on Steam and much more off Steam, it helped me learn more in-depth about World War 2 and made me truly see the effects of the war. 9/10+Unique game with much replayability+ Extremly In-depth if you want it to be+ Able to attack a country through unique ways+ Great moding community with WW1 mods to game enhancing mods such as ICE-  Bugs, often forcing a reinstall after a unknown period of time- No official servers
An amazing game that I have sunk so many hours into, this game is the height of FPS and FPS-Strategy, this Military Simulator offers many modes, missions and it's own editor.Modes - The main modes are:Campaign - The main ARMA 2 campaign with additional DLC campaigns, you can also input player-made campaigns into this by pasting them into the folder.Missions - Random missions that can either be played in singleplayer with AI or multiplayer with some mates, the developers were so generous to include scripted missions to show off the potential of the editor, even the campaign was made with the editor!Editor - Probrally the best thing about the game, the in-game editor, a VERY simple layout of the map where you can plot units, vehicles, buildings, groups, etc and give them objectives, or if you're proficent, scripts. The editor utilizes everything about the game and is A LOT of fun, you can make huge battles, EVAC missions, training missions, anything you can think off!Gamemodes - There are a variety of gamemodes that're imputted into the game, the main one is CTI (Capture the Island), however, there are many player made ones, such as Takistani Life, Domination, Wasteland and many more.ARMA 2 OA is a amazing game offering a endless amount of possibities and is why I have sunk over 300 hours onto it, it is a great game and is so unique, unlike many FPS shooters these days... *cough* Call of Duty *cough* It's cheap, it's fun and if you can break through the learning curve, you'll LOVE this game! 10/10 - True game of the decade!
A great game that should have been more popular then it was.It had average graphics at the time, but the level of customasation and features is amazing, I had no idea games could be this good back in the 1990's.There are multiple maps and levels (go up to level 9) for every map, this game should not be underestimated, it has good voice acting and realistic damage system, exept for fire explosions.There are quite a few bugs that they simply coulden't have fixed due to finances, such as many graphic bugs (nothing to major), enemies and soldiers glitching on the battlefield which isn't too major depending on the severity of the bug.There are also a few bugs that are commonly known, but I don't think its nessesary to list 'em.I give the game a 8.5/10 for being a amazing game and having quite an early development time.I can't wait for the new X-com. X-com: Enemy Unkown :D
A very interesting game which depicts depression very well, I feel the game is quite relatable and I often see myself thinking similar to the individual in the game.The game supports a suicide help service by donating donations to it and is quite an honorable thing to do, not only did they make the game a compelling and relatable experience, you can see they tried to make it as realistic as possible without going to far, I have only played one playthrough and felt very compelled and effected by the different choices and the outcome that would await me.If you suffer or have suffered from depression, I feel this would be a great experience due to its relatability and may help you make choices in regard to said depression, but be aware the game can be dark and can trigger. A compelling game which is relatable and realistic, with a modern touch, I feel it is a brilliant game with it's feautres, not every developer can make you tear up at a wall of text. :)
