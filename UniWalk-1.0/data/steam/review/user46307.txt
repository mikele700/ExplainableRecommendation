I think that bit.trip runner 2 is a good game. I really like the graphics and the world design. I do not reccomend this to gamers that rage very easily because this is a rage game. i think people who like runner games and people that can handle only having 2 checkpoints in levels (the start line and a checkpoint in the middle) AAAAAARGH!!!!!!! But in conclusion i give this game a 9/10 because they could of put more checkpoints in!Bunny out!         /--        /--                          I I _ _ I I                         /             --                        I    -    -    I                        --      ^      /                         ---------
