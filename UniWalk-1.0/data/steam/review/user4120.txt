Well I think this game Is officially going to die, its been out for a year now and yet not 1 Decent patch for optimization they just keep releasing More items/dinos along with MORE bugs/ Poor Performance and Terrible Mechanics, It-'s funny I remember reading that they Won-'t Optimize the game until they complete the game, But they aren-'t even working on finishing their game...Not to mention that Wildcard is Now abusing their Customers, and Charging $20 for DLC for a Un-finished game and saying that they -undercharged us for the original game- (cost me ♥♥♥♥ING 50$ AUS when it was released! and now another $28 for this -dlc-)The Devs are also One-Sided, I was banned from all official servers for -Banned for Griefing player, Continued abuse of Breaking players housings and looting items, blah blah something about killing his Dinos aswell- WHILST ON A PVE SERVER, um hello i can-'t EVEN touch other players stuff on pve.... But thanks for asking MY side of story before BANNING ME, I even Emailed them Evidence and Explained the situation only for them to NOT reply reguarded my one sided ban...
Really Regretting buying this game, The idea and concept of the game is amazing and it would be super fun if the game developers knew how to make a working game, but hey its ubisoft what do you expectNo Lag detection, Bad netcoding, You die without hearing a shot but watch your killcam and the enemy is shooting you for 2-3s on the cam, Terribly slow inbetween rounds,you play a 2min round wait 5mins till next round,  there has been no After work on this game after release, its buggy poorly coded and generally bad ping all round!
