It's a game i recommend for you but only to play with your friends as when you finish the story there is only some multiplayer modes left in there and so garry's mod does not use alot of mods that need this game. So buy it with your friends or don't buy it as you will exaust the single player aspect rather quickly.
Play it NOAAW!
You should buy this because of all the crazy and weird modz you can install and plus to test the extent of how powerful you computer id and it still looks good even on low setting and it runs smoothly
LOL
