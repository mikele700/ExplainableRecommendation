I can-'t recommended this game highly enough. Its minecraft, in space, with a story, on steroids. I’ve played for over 200 hours and I honestly expect to play for another 200 more. Its all the freedom you want in a sandbox game but enough structure and lore to make the universe feel really -alive-. I’ve built little wooden huts on farming worlds and I-'ve built space stations in asteroid belts with zero G train to my own private moon lair. The possibilities for role playing in this game are really endless even outside a sci-fi setting so I-'m amazed its not one of the main tags for this game. If your an adventurer at heart ... Play.
