Guns, explosions, spaceshipes, rocket launchers, gatling guns, pvp, what hasn't it got. Amazing game, love it.
If you are like me and want something more than the run and gun, lack of strategy, Call of duty then csgo is for you. With its thrilling competitive gameplay its really a much better experience. Csgo provides and enjoyable ranking system that pushes the user to play there best and engage in team based strategy (at the higher levels as low ranks suck and are salty). Unlike cod and other fps's you can derank if too many games are lost. However on the other hand there are negatives like hackers which can be a real pain and overall ruin the experience and the saltiness of the low silver ranks. This is not really a bad thing but there are weapon skins that can be very expensive and if you don't restrain yourself you will have yourself throwing out the dosh in order to gain some of these sexy skins. Overall csgo gives and amazing strategy based experience, it has its negatives but are highly out-weighed by the positives, i recommend this game to anyone seeking a more skill based experience with less of the rpg style of cod, cause lets face it cod is all about leveling up you character and getting new weapons, a lot like other rpg's.I hope this was helpful.
I got this in a humble bundle, and so i decided to try it, and i am like wtf is this. the only positive thing to this is all the wird landscape and wierd animals. my favourite part is how your eyes sloly close as you hold escape, but thats about it. Its a good game if you like constantly looking at brightly iluminated landscape artwork that moves, but otherwise don't buy it.
Do not buy this game it actually sucks, enemy cars teleport and are invincible tyhe tutorial is just about impossible. i hate this game dont buy it.    :(
