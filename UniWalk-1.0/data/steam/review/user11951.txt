They can take my nests, They can almost kill the game. But that doesn't mean they won't come back stronger and better than ever. This game is one of the reasons i got into pc gaming, i thought it was an amazing game and that it had an amazing community where the only salty people are the people who go kill hunting in PVP Chill Rooms. If you're looking for a game that has a great community, a great fluid-combo based battle system and afk pvp rooms than this is the game for you.
