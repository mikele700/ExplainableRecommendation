Good fun, much harder than I thought it would be. You need to be patient, build up slowly and ensure you manage your resources well. The first few times I played I got things ticking over nicely and thought I'd leave my resources to stockpile and went off to make a sandwich, when I came back nearly everyone was dead and my base was in pieces. I'm a long way off mastering this little beauty.
I love this - it's stunning & relaxing. I've been putting everyone who calls over in here for a taster of my ney toy and watch their jaws drop
