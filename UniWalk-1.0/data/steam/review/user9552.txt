A delightfully rich and exciting FPS experience which explores the concept of gameplay as a visualisation of a first person narrative. The Wild West style and aesthetic is gorgeous, the gun play endlessly entertaining and the almost constant storytelling and banter between the rugged bounty hunter Silas Greeves and his audience a joy to listen to.
Super Crate Box is a fast-paced, high difficulty, platform-shooter experience. In SCB, you navigate a single screen, platformed environment collecting crates and avoiding enemies. Each time you collect a crate you are given a random weapon, and weapons are progressively unlocked as your total crate count increases. Upon contact with an enemy, the player will die immediately. The game provides a moderately steep difficulty curve, and fluent, twitch-based combat and movement. The crate collecting objective, minimal gameplay and single screen environment are highly accessible and reminiscent of original arcade games.But, due to the simplicity of the gameplay, certain faults can significantly retract from the gaming experience. Whilst the weapons are reasonably well balanced, certain inconsistencies (i.e. disc gun damaging players) can be very frustrating. Also, because of excessively accurate hit boxes, unfair deaths are reasonably frequent. But despite this, Super Crate Box is a fun, addictive and highly accessible arcade experience.
