After 4 hours I've finally figured out how to create a stable pod-racer engine.
I'll start by saying that Boo Bunny Plague is a fantastic game, worth the price and worthy of a sequel.Where this game shines is in it's character. The best way to describe this game is that it feels like Metalocapyse, Aqua Teen Hunger Force and the Brak show put together. It combines great music, funny dialouge and an interesting world. At no point does it feel like your playing a game but rather experiencing a story worthy of a primetime slot on Adult Swim.In keeping with that comparison this game does not at any point feel like it has a high production cost, not saying that it didn't cost the develouper a lot to make it. The game mechanics are also not very innovative and the art is stylized but not detailed to the degree some people may be used to. However for a game like this I think none of that matters. It has all the mechanics needed to keep a player engauged and help tell the story, not to mention the game genuenly feels challenging on normal.Play this game if you want to experience a fun story with memorable characters and I guarantee you will want a sequel by the end. It's also worth getting the delux version before or after playing, with extra delux! So much deluxing...
Planetside 2 can be best summed up as -an orchestra of war-.The sheer scale of it as well as the polish makes this game a true experience without having to boast about it. Whether playing alone or with a squad it will provide you challenges that always feel unique. You will definately have stories to tell, playing this game.
