When I picked up this game on promotion , I didnt know what to expect , I have heard review of it , but let me tell you .This video game actually made me concerned for the characters. I didnt want to see how many ways laura could die , I wanted to save her friends so badly, so much so that I had to remind myself that time wont affect the outcome of the game and I could go off venturing into the tombs and raiding it.Its an adventure game , and in that sense if accomplishes exactly that. I felt empty after the game was over. It took me on a heck of an unforgettable adventure , despite it being -generic- or not . I felt attached and but sad that i completed it only over 4.5 hours with 75% completion and all tombs raided.What I really hope for the sequel is that laura isint an invincible badass , just a badass. Even though she does superhuman things ingame , I really she will be human and she will continue caring for others.
