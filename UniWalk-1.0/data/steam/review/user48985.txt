Great game concept with massive varieties between the characters that are available, Batlleborn offeres an experience that is unique from other shooters. The only problem I have with it is performance issues as it seems a little unoptomised at this point in time.
Excellent Rally game, provides a challenging experience. Stunning visuals, and excellent car handling, would recommend to all rally enthusiasts.
Great game for those who have borderlands 2 or 1 or even those who are new to the franchise! Great experience for borderlands fans, explains everything about what happend BEFORE borderlands 2 including how handsome jack became so evil.
Amazing experience, great writing, excellent story, hilarious comedy, I loved every moment of it!I really hope Telltale make a season 2 for this game!
