Love the game, full of tactics but at the same time free flowing. So much fun!
While first seeing the mixed reviews, I was unsure about how this game was going to play. But with what I've played so far, it's an amazing game. It's exploring and crafting system is quite fun, and the knowledge that the planet you're on, is only one of billions is quite mind blowing. I'm incredibly excited to see where this game goes.
