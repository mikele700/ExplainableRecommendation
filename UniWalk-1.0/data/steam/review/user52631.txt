This game would be amazing if it ACTUALLY WORKED!!!!!!!!!!!
Fun game but one massive problem.Whenever  I go into a game, i get above and beyond 1500 ping!!!Thats completely unacceptable.
After the most recent update to this game, every twenty minutes or so, the game just stops for no reason and i have to restart my computer.Unacceptable.Fix and i'll be happy.
Looks very cool, but it would be nice if it actually worked.
Loved this game, thought it was great fun until one game-breaking, (well, a bit more than that) the game was deleted from my hard drive so i had to do the 9.1 gb download again.other than that, gg.
This game is a laggy, confusing, pathetic excuse for a game.Do not waste bandwidth or hard drive space on this game.It's not worth it
