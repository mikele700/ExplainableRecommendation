I had a long, hard think about it. And yes it is a lot of money for what is essentially a few new guns, it was a lot of money for 2 new helicopters. But what I failed to understand then was that Bohemia do things differently. They-'re not your -Activision- or -EA- that spam out the same, un-original DLC time and time again just as  a simple cash grab. Bohemia listen to their community (granted you-'re being constructive with your critisizm) and they aren-'t scabbing money off you for cheap. Remember Karts? All funds raised from that went to charity.Helicopters and Marksmen are priced as they are because you support the developers and development of the game. We-'ve been given a bulk of the DLC for free, infact we-'ve been given everything for free in the recent downloadable content, all bar the ability to pilot the two new helicopters and a new showcase for sling-loading. I-'m not a professional when it comes to game development, but I understand the constraints a small team like Bohemia have and I pledge my support to them, because they-'ve made a series that not even your most popular shooters today come close to rivling.Something that will come in the future is bigger DLC, much like BAF, PMC and ACR were to Arma 2. There just needs to be a better understanding within the community of Bohemia-'s goals and aims with this game. I-'ve seen many people hang so much ♥♥♥♥ on this game yet they-'re not able to see the greater picture.
You have never played a more engrossing and realistic shooter until you've played Arma2 and the Arma series. The best simulator i've ever had the joy of playing, despite it's age it still holds up with some nice visuals, sounds and gameplay. Drop your CoD games kids, this is where you can grow up!
