Although a really interesting game in theory it's just too damn hard and frustrating. There doesn't seem to be any real strategy in dealing with stress and so the game becomes a frustrating grind where you feel like you are close to a win but then are forced to retreat... which probably fails... so you take more stress damage.... and when you do retreat the resulting stress kills your favourite guy with a heart attack... The whole thing just felt unfair. I'm all for a challenging game but I expect a strategy I can employ to overcome it, just dumb luck and feeling like everything is against you regardless of skill is not fun. Sorry.
Different play style to L4D but a great dose of zombie chopping... ♥♥♥♥♥♥ accents is the only gripe :)
