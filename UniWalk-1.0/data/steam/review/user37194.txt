Firstly, this game is Ok. You know the problem? In this game, the mechs are overpriced. They cost like 12k credits. each round i only get bout 120credits. Seriously, are the devs trying to get people to spend real money or what. its like literally a pay to win for the good robots.(U still need skills though). I really hope the devs can either lower the price or make some readjustments.Secondly, this game doesnt let you try out mechs you want. You have to wait till the mechs are on trial. And there are tens of mechs in this game. So what do they expect you to do if u buy a mech but dont like it. They expect you to GRIND AND GRIND again. And worse still you cant sell mechs.Still fun though. Just make sure you find your playstyle and TRY NOT TO BUY THE WRONG MECH LIKE ME*supois internally*
