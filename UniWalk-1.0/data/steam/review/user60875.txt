DayZ is a good game but a few problems are that it's still in early access and it has many bugs that are a bit annoying to play with and the game can be quite boring without other people by your side when you first join, and the controlls take a little while to get use to (if you're havinng trouble with the controlls then just search up DayZ help/guide/walkthrough on the internet, that's what I did :D) but overall DayZ is a great game despite it's bugs and other problems it has. I recommend this game to everyone but make sure you can handle it (it's not scary but some people are just wimps).
