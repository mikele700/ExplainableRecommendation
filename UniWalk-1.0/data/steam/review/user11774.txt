Tera is absolutely AMAZING!! I love this game and it is my favourite MMORPG. I have played played this game for over 200 hours and i have loved almost every minute, so naturally when came out on steam, I HAD To get it. The only part I didn't like about was the endless running back and forth handing in quests, but they have even gotten ridden that part so really, for me, there are no faults in the game. I was able to finish Island of Dawn for both my Elin Slayer AND my High Elf Gunner in less than 3 hours wheras before it took me about 5 hours to get off the island with my Castanic Warrior. They also made updated the skill obtaining sector of the game so now, instead of having to see a Tactition or Magic Instructor, you can just get the skill just by cliking on it, and i love that because it SO much time and effort. The game updates are amazing and recomend the game to any MMO fans, though you need a lot of space on your device because the game is HUGE. TERA IS AMAZING!!!!!  XD XP
