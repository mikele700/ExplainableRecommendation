i love this game one of my favorites through the whole series. one thing i have to start off with is that i have some total wars but i am not an expert so i will not be comparing as i have put more time in Attila and Rome one as total war and have not played much of shogun 2 and napoleon but the forst thing i have to say is this game is not for every one. it is a 4x game and a tough one i have made a couple campaigns and saw what i though was a great force turn to ash and rubble but this challege keeps it interesting. i enjoy the impressive scope of the campaign map and the epic battles that can take place but one of the main reason why i love this game is because i was a civ 5 fan but after rome 1 i fell in love with this series this game with some mods here and there make this a 4 x masterpiece to some like me but there are the faults of the constant content made into dlc i have only bought one and that is the blood and burning which seems like the one most people would avoid i just got thedlc since i feel like it fits the games -post apopalitic- theme where the world is burning to the ground so overall i love Attila but hates SEGA ffor the constant dlc that was never like this in total war until rome 2. I have high hopes for total war warhammer after Atilla. And i CA dosen-'t make the same mistake as rome 2
