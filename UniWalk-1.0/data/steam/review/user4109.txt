It is by far one of the best games I have ever played. The game itself is immersive, combining every good aspect of the Borderlands story with interactivity. The humor and references just make it even better.To top it all off, it has Handsome Jack, which is inarguably, the best Hero/Antagonist in all of gamming history.23/10.
This game is just too... Awesome!It's retro RPG style is just great, you can even feel the nostalgia of playing and old RPG.It's the kind of game that holds your attention for many hours, even days.If you're thinking about buying it, just do it already, you won't regret it!(The one thing you might regret is spending so many hours into this game. ;-;)
Awsome, but quite the rage inducing!
This game... There aren't word to describe how good it is...PS:DO NOT PET UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE!
