I would love to say that this is just as awesome as the original, if not more so. But, on my Alienware laptop, with all hardware better than the listed required hardware, with graphics not even at it's best, I struggle to get even 15fps at any good time. Maybe there is something I could do to get it to run better, and advice would be greatly welcomed, but from what I have been able to do, I haven't been able to play the game for any decent amount of time. Hopefully, optimization patches in the future may help. It's just disappointing having a laptop that can run Shadow of Mordor and World of Warcraft on decent graphics, but not even get 15fps on a game much smaller than both listed gamesFrom what I am reading from other people's reviews, I would still recommend the game
