Great game, innoative and unique. If your a big indie games buff this game NEEDS to be in your collection.
If you like those business/tycoon/multi-management sort of games. This might end up being one of your most favourited games. Your aim is to build and maintain a maximum security prison whilst managing your prisoners needs, security, staff and your amount of revenue. Overall it's a great game with lots to do that will have you playing for hours. =)
