EDIT: only 2/3 weeks ago I used to play this game on medium quality with no lag, now I had to set it to its lowest graphical settings and cnt get more than 30fps, with lagspikes going down to 8 fps, I dont know wether it was one of the Updates, but if it was please fix this, it makes the game unbearable.Yes this game is alot of fun, however it needs quite some balancing.Allied Bots for example are useless. This makes 1v1 beacon battles in a Long Range Frigate (sniper) almost impossible.some modules a way OP others totaly underpowered (eg the reload time on Gunship modules removing negative effects is way too long while other ships can pretty much immediately debuff your ship again)Gunships are also too slow in my opinion, while any interceptor can juggle any other ship with ease if a pilot knows what he is doing, making them sometimes impossible to hit.Also there is not a very good Help section in the game and the online Wiki is incomplete (not to mention half russian)This game has a crapton of content though, many different modi and a great gameplay. It ranges from PVE missions over PVP arenas to (pretty much) OpenWorld space adventure. All in all 7 out of 10 stars.
Not much to say about this game other than:Extremely frustrating, oldshool fun!Edit: The Skulls are gamebreakers though
Update: The AI has been updated, the game is a  lot more intuitive now.This game is an unforgiving RTS survival game with retro graphics.You have to make sure all your basic ressources are allways available or the game is over.RecommendedI want to endorse this game, I really do.However until the AI of the survivors is updated and they stop starving with tons of chicken already slaughtered in the pen, I cannot recommend. It's just way to frustrating not to be able to do anything....I might just be stupid though.
