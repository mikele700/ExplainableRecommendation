this game is super fun to play and if you support net nutrallity like me you will love it
warframe is a third person shoter you play a co op campaign the campaign is super long i am not even close to finishing it the missions are super fun to play with a freind i would give this game 9/10
tf2(team Fortress 2) is the best free to play first person shoter there is an endless amount of fun to be had ther are 8 oficial game modes and lots of community made modes and a beta game mode and in general the game is lots of fun to play with freinds
airmech is a really great game it tests your ability to comunicate and quickly stratigize and for a f2p game there is not much pay to win  stuff and its super fun when you are playing with a freind i would give it 8/10
