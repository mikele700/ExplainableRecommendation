a definite must! only shame is no multiplayer feature.....
i like it but for me COH2 just doesnt have the nitty gritty feel of realism that COH1 did, the units look over sized and the colours just seem to...computerish to me....look, gameplay is improved in some areas to COH such as cover, but i would have liked some variation in the units apart from just having 3 sets of almost the same looking dudes just with better weaopns, i mean had they gone with the volksgrenadiers having field caps then i would probably not be complaining oo much about it.
glad i got this
