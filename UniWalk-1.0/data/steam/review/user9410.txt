I-'m quite annoyed that I keep getting this game re-gifted to me by my friends. First, it was Dino: Beatdown, which was totally ordinary and mod-like in presentation (and not a good one at that), second I was gifted Dino: Horde, and I wasn-'t even sure if it was a different game.  Finally, I was gifted this version, and while better than the other two, I-'d hardly call a new engine a few more features a new game. It feels like there is always a new attempt at getting this game finished, it gets some updates, and then promptly disappears under a new title.  Would like to see some sort of -finality- (and I mean real finality, not just stop updating it or re-releasing it as something else).  The concept is great, but the delivery is constantly flawed, which is a real shame.
Slight tweaking of Counter strike source.  Happy to report that the bots are still there if you don't feel confident about getting right into online. Runs smoothly on practically any system, but manages to look better than CS Source. Overall, a great purchase, especially if on sale!
