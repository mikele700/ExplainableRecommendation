Pretty much the best game ever!I think that this game is better when played with friends, rather than bots/anonymous people, but I can't know, because none of my friends play it with me. :(However, the characters are fun, and the fast paced gameplay is really fun. This new 2D take on the MOBA genre is generally a great game, and, while the matchmaking could use some work, the devs are constantly improving the game (They have promised to improve the matchmaking, so hopeat issue is soon resolved)I hope this review convinced you to buy the game! The devs definitely deserve it!
