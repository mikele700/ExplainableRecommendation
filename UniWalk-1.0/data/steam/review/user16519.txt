TL:DRYou got this far, if you like the screenshots and the style the short answer is -yes, it-'s not a bad game, amusing and if you like 3DS style games but on a PC then go for it-Longer review.Most of my gameplay comes from the earlier versions, although I sunk a few hours into it recently, redid some of the beginning parts again, unlocked some of the new achievements etc.My overall review is that I enjoyed the game  - it pushed some of the right buttons to make me remember (fondly) some of my gaming times 30 odd years ago, playing Wastelands, Star Command and similar - it also dragged in that feeling of playing the old handheld console like a DS but on a larger screen.There were parts that felt like a grind, and battles at times become repetitive (until you unlocked a new skill etc to do it different) however all in all I found pushing thru an area to see what was next wasn-'t a chore.I-'ll avoid spoiling anything in this so I-'ll skip the storyline as it plays out but while it-'s not Bill Shakespeare it flowed well and I like a good post apocalyptic setting.There were moments were the gameplay made my hair greyer, like finding a firearm and thinking -Woo- only to check the backpack (or soggy paperbag as it might be) and finding a whopping 2 shells.Will I play it more? YesWould I recommend it? At a indie game where the creator is active, it-'s price is good - great if you grab it on a sale of course.Glad to have got it in Early Development as well, as happy to have supported earlier
Stardock does it again - another great game if only you have the time to play it - expect a sitting lke playing Civ - where did that last 2 hours go....
