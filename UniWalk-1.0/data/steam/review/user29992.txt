incredible, great. it has dark drawings and an amazing storyline, with everything the william carter puzzles & forbiden knowledge  makes it eligible for the awesomerest game in the history of everything!!!!!! (sorry for bad grammar- if any)
despite the fact that the graphics are horrible, I can't see where the action points are, it's funny how they move so slowly
