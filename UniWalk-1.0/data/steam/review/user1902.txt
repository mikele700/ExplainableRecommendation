This game is a great start, for any new Marvel fans. It combines the funny humour of a LEGO game, with Marvel's superheroes and villains. These two things together creates a masterpiece, that every Marvel fan should give a shot.8/10
This was a really edgy mod. It adds to the lore of Portal and gives it's own spicy story. Though I did noclip like half of the game because was extremely hard (in my opinion). I wouldn't call that a complaint though, as it was made to be hard. Besides that I still enjoyed the majority of the game. The voice acting in this is impressive too.If you enjoyed Portal 2 then you should definitely get this as it is FREE.
