Absolutely amazing game.The story is very deep and emotional. It's nice to be away from all the FPS and RPG games and be able to playing something as emotionally engaging as this. This is my very first review on steam, of all the games I have ever played this one stood out the most. I know this game is ignored by hundreds and thousands but if anyone is reading this review, do buy this game ignore everything everyone else is saying and trust me it will be worth it.
First of all, I am surprised by how well the game runs. 8 hours in and I am yet to experiences any lag or major glitches.Great graphics, Combat, and HUGE open world with loads to do. With all that being said, the contolls feel a little too heavy. Either its driving, combat, climbing or simply walking around. Not sure if it would be better with a controller but I prefer to play with my keyboard and mouse. It's fine once you get used to used it, but just a matter of fact that it's and issue that exists. Overall, Kudos to Avalanche Studios, for delivering us a great game. 9/10
Great fun :)
The previous Batman Games were absolutely amazing! Can't belive the amount you guys stuffed up these time. Dont understand why a game thats been made using a PC is so badly optimized FOR PC....
