Game wasn't as hard as I thought (played 1st time on 2nd hardest setting as I normally do) and didn't really like the end.Nice gameplay throughout, only used the shooting crouched and run-slide during the tutorial stages, thought there would be less hints of where to go on the harder settings, I'd hate to try the game on the wimpy setting..The difference in difficulty on the 2nd hardest as compared to the original, well the original, I wouldn't have finished it yet.
