i hate those chainsaw monsters they are fast and you cannot shoot them and sometimes if run out of energy (stamina) i jump and i die
okay i kind a like it and its an art but its kind a bit boring and you will get back to the start and nothing really happens but i still kind a like it
god love really love this game and they made it free horray now i can play thx steam or valve? :)
i hope that they make this free on xmas and god this game is scary i could even finish it at the end
can i play with a player pls.... i cannot leave the area cannot do it alone i need a player so i can finish the map
man love this game i hope they put the tanks in the game
