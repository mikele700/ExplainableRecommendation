Definitely a fun and ammusing game to play. Whether you are taking your time and farming up, or raiding others and trolling around. This game is just plain fun in any aspect. Since it's also only in Alpha, definitely get in on the fun and play the game while it develops and only gets better. I like how the game removed the zombies as most other survival games have zombies. Which allows for this game to offer a bit more of a unique style to the stale market or survival games. I just get sick of zombies to be perfectly honest. They are way over done. I find it fun to able to play a game such as this early in development and find all the funny and stupid things. Such as getting chicken from anything but chickens. If you are unsure whether to buy this game or not. You shouldn't put it off! It's crazy fun and makes for some good times. With or without friends. Even when you are killed and killed and killed many times by farmed people. You always seem to want to get back in it and get them back :DSO GET THIS GAME!!But if you are one of those people who insists on seeing a game for yourself before you play it. Just check out some of the streamers on twitch. Some of those guys have 1000+ hours and will be able to show you how to play the game for the best start. So you will be able to choose whether to buy it or not, but also not go into the game completely out of knowledge!  Hope this review helps your decision!
Great game. Easily worth 15 Dollars.
One of the best free games available! get on it!
