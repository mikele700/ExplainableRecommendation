For People who love the Men of War Series you should definately give Call to Arms a try.Although its early access and there is no vehicles in multiplayer yet i definately recommend this game if you ever wanted a modern age in Men of War.Though i would like to request that the Helicopters should be able to hover like in men of war vietnam and maybe you should add an animation where troops zipline from the helicopter instead of landing in the middle of a battlefield and pretty much get shot down instantly. Apart from my request i guess the game is 9/10 just add More Vehicles and maybe more Factions but i dont know about that though.It would be cool if there were more:FactionsMaps Vehicles New AnimationsMore Units And maybe Battleships (Maybe)
Yess I recommend you to get his game.It is awesome
Yes i would recommend this game cause it is awesome!!!!!!!!!!
I give the game 9/10It is a good game, Im not sure about the skins though it makes it look like csgo like game now since they added safes to crack its pretty much the csgo unboxing boxes getting stuff. The micro trancastions, skins and the safes are kind of a bad idea. I don't like itBut overall i think it is a great game 
This Game is Awesome in multiplayer
