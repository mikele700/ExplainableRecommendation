Great game! Reminds me a lot of theme hospital and the original dungeon keeper. It has a bit of a steep learning curve, but other than that it is faultless.
Awesome game! Campaign was cheesy and short, but i thoroughly enjoyed it. Multiplayer is fun with plenty of replay as there are heaps of units to experiment with. In terms of technical RTS it lacks a little compared to Supcom 1 but i still enjoyed it.
