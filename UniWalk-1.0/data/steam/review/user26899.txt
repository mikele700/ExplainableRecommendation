After playing it for 25 hours i stopped playing it :|
The game is really cool graphics but i don't play the campain i only play online but i need to change my graphics card because i get around 30 40 to 45 fps which is good.
It has 10 times more guns than the counter strike series but still i give it 8.9/10 rubber scouts. xD
Well i play this game on maxed out graphics with filter to 4x and texturing also on 4 i play it at the highest resolution my monitor does (1280x1024) and  in mostly all the time i get 60-75-80 fps and in bad times it dropped down to 50-40 or 20. Morral of the review: put in a better graphics card for better performance xD                                                    but i am giving it 9.7/10
i play this on maxed out graphical setting and resolution (1280x1024) and the fps most of the time is 80-90or 95 and at bad times and depending on the map it droppes down to 20-30- or 45. Morall of the story: buy a better graphics card xDps: why valve didn't make an offical tralier :|                                                             i am ging it 9.7/10
