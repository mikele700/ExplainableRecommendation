AWESOME game. Levels are interesting and original, and the story can be quite amusing. Can be very difficult at times, but that just makes finding a solution so much more satasfying. Great fun to play
A true example of CNC gameplay and storyline. WAY over the top plot and very bright graphics take away the serious edge and make it a lot of fun to play. Very thought-out units and the gameplay is quite balanced. Great place to start if your new to the series although the tutorials are a bit unnecessary and lengthy for the old hands. It carrys the CNC legancy well and adds something new to the series. Great game and a lot of fun to play. 9/10
