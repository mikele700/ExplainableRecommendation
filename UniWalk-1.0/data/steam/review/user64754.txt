BEST GAME THAT WAS EVER ****ING MADE
It's a good game but often it lags a lot and takes a while to load. At times the combat system feels clunky and I prefer to run this game without steam as it tends to run better.
Dont let my hours fool you, Im a battlerank 55 at the time of posting this and I have put over 100 USD into the game.Its a great game, and crashing reavers with c4 on them into deployed sunderers makes you feel like a true rebel.9/11 would suicide bomb sundies again[IMPORTANT INFORMATION]Pie recipe [VERY IMPORTANT]Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons UNSALTED butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.
