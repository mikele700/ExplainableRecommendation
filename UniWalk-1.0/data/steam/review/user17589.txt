Make MiataPut biggest engine possible in itTurbocharge the absolute sh!t out of itPOWAHHHHHScreamed -SLIDE ROAD BRAZIL-Fanboys got upset at me10/10In all seriousness this game is awesome and fun. Love wasting time in it, and content is always being added. Recent physics update really made it much more realistic. Camber mods are fun. Turbo sounds cool. Rims look mad. Good game. Its cheap and fun, plus you can do tandems if the other person isn-'t mentally stupid! But be aware, some people in the community are a tad -special-. Have fun on -Slide Road Brazil-!
I have completed Dementuim: The Ward and now this. Truly amazing horror game and a must get! In my opinion Dementuim: The Ward has more of a scarier vibe, but this one has a much wider range of enemies but still is quite scary. I love the designs on the bosses and even the enemies, they were really creative. So this is a must get for all puzzle/adventure/horror game fans. Great job i hope to see a remake of the first game or a third Dementuim, great job!
Make sure you have counter strike source, but other than that this game is bloody amazing and i love learning new things on it :D
