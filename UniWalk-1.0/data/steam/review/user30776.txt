here is a list of the things i think can make this game better . i know that alot of this stuff is being worked on but this is my review on what needs to be done so far. -more customization, make the soldier and weapons completley customable. -unlocks (on everything) (within reason)-wide variety of weaopns -voices -genders -more of and objective on maps/modes -easier identifies on teamates -overlying story -vehicles? -emblems -more of an importance on tactics !-lockers (for unlocks and such) ( own menu)-lore -classes -a little bit of fast gameplay -easier coms -more to be added
