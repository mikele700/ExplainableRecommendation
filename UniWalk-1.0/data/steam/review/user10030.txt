If you're buying this to play online, don't no1 plays even when its on sale for 66% off theirs rarely more than 1-2 people looking to join, really needs a server list instead of just having a quick join and create option
This is the only MMORPG i've ever properly enjoyed, the others i've played have got stale within the first week. Archeage is a huge step in the right direction for MMOs it's combat never gets stale and if it does you can just change your class whenever and wherever you want, you never run out of things to do even with the labour system which really helps the games economy from people who would just grind out the same items making them useless which is happened in so many games i've played.Tradepacks are a revolutionary tool and is so perfect for Archeage you use your farmed materials to make them (there is about 4 unique tradepacks per region) i've gone on countless trips across the sea with friends sinking ships killing and dying while delivering these tradepacks for either gilda stars (which you use to purchase plans for ships/vehicles/houses+ a few others) or you can trade it in for gold (i've personally not tried the third hand in) The design of the game is so beautiful every way you look you're amazed by how far you can see and the quality of everything, every new area you enter is like entering a new world new plants and trees grow that you might not have seen before, i'm discovering new trees and so many new areas i've never been now i'm level 50.Every little detail is this game has been looked at and refined perfectly i can't wait for the rest of the Korean version to be ported over, a recent update has also made the game alot smaller to download, and they have also said they won't be forcing us to download huge patches they will be rolled out at around 800mb-1gb which was a big problem for me when i played WoW! If you do choose to buy or wait untill archeage is released for f2p as soon as you jump on you'll wish you had it sooner this it the best game i have EVER played full stop i highly recommend the Archeum pack to jump into the Alpha with us all now :) Purchase some land and breed your polar bears for an awesome polar bear mount! what more do you want?? a black one? well they have it! Don't get me started about the naval side of things it's INCREDIBLE from the water to your ship to the mightiest Galleon you'll never get bored with this game.
