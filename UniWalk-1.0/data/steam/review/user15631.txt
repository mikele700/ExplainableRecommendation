It's optimization is bad but the gameplay is addictive and very fun. Overall I recommend Ark Survival Evolved
yo dis gaem is so ♥♥♥♥in gr8 it lik has ur frengds stealin yo guns an ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥, yo dis game is mah ♥♥♥♥.
It's has very good graphics that is not suitible for many computers, some mechanics are still glitchy, There are tons of hackers which I find very sad, the Building Allowed thing is a bit glitchy, The picking up or taking thing is weird because you have to click the top of the object to take it all. Apart from all that the game is good.
This game was quite short but a fun learning experiece and is very satisfying when you finish playing it.
It is better than Agar.io cause facebook is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ :P.
