This game has TRUE potential to be something of legends.Even though this game isint completed yet, It's current state has amazing things to offer.It wont be too long before we go from Drag racing BMW's to Racing a Bugatti Veyron SS around the Nurburgring...But well have to wait and see.Highly reccomend this game! Give it a go!
Can't wait for this game to come out of Early Access
Remember those Flash Games you would play at school when the Teacher wasen't Looking? This is pretty much like that. And as you'd expect, its just as good. Simple, Addictive and plenty of fun. My only real complaint would be that there isint a leaderboard. But not a big deal.7.5/10Nothing amazing, just straightforward and addictive, like most games should be.
Because of the ability to kill your friends in multiplayer, I declare this the Mario Party of Platformers.
I can only sum this game up in one word:WHAT!?
Even Today, DOOM and it's sequals manage to be some of the greatest FPS in history. It revolitionized the Industry and if it werent for DOOM, Shooters would be nothing like they are today.Happy 20th Birthday!
