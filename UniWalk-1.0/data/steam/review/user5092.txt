Nowhere near as complete as earlier editions. RPG elements mostly stripped out, SPECIAL and Perks reworked so every character feels generic. Charisma builds pointless, no path through the game for an evil character, weak dialogue. Landscape largely empty and same-y compared to earlier editions. Settlement building was a good idea, but execution is terrible here. Weakest game in the series by far. Haven't bought DLC but heard it's horrible. If this wasn't Bethesda, and a fallout game, I'd give it a 7. But against what these guys are capable of it's a 5. Save your money.
Buy ARMA II for 10 bucks cheaper, get the better-in-every-way dayz mod for free. Dating a girl who tried to get me into this, banged all day in pause menu and can-'t get refund now. 8/10 would do again. You-'d think Valve would have enough of a rep to protect to do something about this -early-access- model as this is THE case study of how 12 dudes can pick up their kickstarter money and give everyone the finger.Seriously though, I didn-'t even get involved in a learning experience before putting this broken piece down. It-'s an overly ambitious project that is broken, and will stay broken. The devs have their money and they are done doing any real work. It is a 10 fps walk through an empty level design. Don-'t buy this thinking it will come into fruition, having engaged the community and done a little research it-'s a no-hoper.
Game is buggy, crashes system, pay to win is everything, no chance to replay awful games in career mode, NO ONE plays multiplayer, massively overpriced
