No paids mods. Lots of free mods and gameplay
This game is very fun. Im a huge fan of the total war series and this is  a great title and probably better than rome 2 or some of the other newer titles. Great combat, awesome seiges and you have to use a good degree of strategy to beat your opponenet, but what really make this game for me is the mods. The mods are the best, making total overhauls or just small adjustments. Its what makes this game long lasting for me. My favourite would be age of Petty Kings,  A Game of thrones mod. Great fun as i conquer my enemies and crush their skulls. The generals also have alot of character as they evolve over    your playthrough. The spearmen are op and you can basically destroy anything with them with minimal loses in my playthrough.  Also on my desktop which has windows eight the game crashes every time i open it, be carefull about that.Recomend you get this, fantastic game and replay value over 10000
awesome game well worth it
Fun game, only problem is the lack of depth and there only 4 factions. Though they all play differently and the mods give the game replayability and add some good mechanics. Good game
fantastic game
