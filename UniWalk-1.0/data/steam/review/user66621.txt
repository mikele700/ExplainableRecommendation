simple but genuis
This game is freaking awsome,it like Battelfield 2142 but with Massively Multiplayer and it better.The game like real-life war,it very easy to die in the battlefield and friendly fire always on.Even my favorite class is Sniper but it extremely difficult to kill a target.Also this game is great for everyone like to explode the world.This is the best teamwork game ever.But that was the good part now here the bad one.It hard to get money in a ridiculous way,everyday i play Planetside 2,it just give me like 10-30 Cert.But meanwhile the money needed to buy a weapon was like 10k-20k,i was like WTF???.And if you want to get more money is to become a memeber,but it like 2 months for 1$ according to my memories.Well that it for a Vietnamese 13 years old boy so overall i recommend this game.Well done Mr.Planetside 2 hope you will have more greater update in the future.Thanks you
i've played this game since the 1.0.0 update,lot of update has been made but it keep better and better.This game is mind-blowing.Best game ever 11/10
