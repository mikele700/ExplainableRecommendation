rollercoaster 10/10
Assassin's Creed II is the follow-up to Ubisoft's 2007 hit that attracted a mass audience if not unanimous critical acclaim. The sequel is an expansive and bloody romp through Renaissance Italy that plays up every popular aspect of the first installment while righting many of its flaws.It is set in italy, as an assassin you want to kill the people you killed your family.this game has above average graphics, nice open world, and better yet, horses.8/10
This game has a nice open world, story and user interface, the game offers a wide range of open world to explore, templers to kill, and horses.The graphics on this might not b the best but they are something.Pretty underrated due to more popular new realeses such as, black flag and unity.8.5/10 it is pretty nice
