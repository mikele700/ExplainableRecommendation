If not compared to any other game, Steel Ocean is all round good game with a good tutorial and intuitive controls.All Ships have an important role in aiding the team and players will have to pay a lot of attention to their surroundings. It makes a all round realistic game because it incorporates Atni Submarine Warfare like real Naval Battles. Ships may be too agile but all ships have the same problem, therefore it is not really a problem.Since many people are saying it is a copy of WoWs, I'm Going to compare it with WoWs.If Compared to WoWs, the matchmaking in Steel Ocean is fairer, The different Tiers are closer (so not an obvious power difference between Tier 2 and 3), And it has submarines which makes Aircraft carriers and battleships more vulnareble to attacks.
