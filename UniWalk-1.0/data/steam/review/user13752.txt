Positive for a game so new def need to work on the surviability aspect of it yes a bow will make life easier but food and the ability to survive waves of the big dogs would be nice
Really good start for a early release well worth it gonna loose alot of hrs to this one
Love it can never get enough
really nice work on the remaster
