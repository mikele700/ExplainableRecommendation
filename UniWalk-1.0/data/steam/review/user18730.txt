Injustice: Gods Among Us is the best fighting game i have ever played. A mix between superheroes and Mortal Kombat was a great idea. This is a good step up from Mortal Kombat. Unfortunately i couldnt get the online to work and you need to mess around in the settings and if you dont you will be fighting in slow-motion. Over all this game is great apart from the online and lag. I will give this game a 8.8.
this game is AWESOME
