Undertale is a great game, when i first saw people playing this on youtube i thought looks good but still not gonna get it, then i saw a couple of my steam friends playing it, I asked them how the game was and they all up gave the same answer but not the same way, then i went a got the game for my self and all i can say is, the characters are charming the story is great and the best part for me is Sans, with his puns, they keep tickles my funny bone.
