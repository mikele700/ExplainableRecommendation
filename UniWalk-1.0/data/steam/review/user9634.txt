Heroes and Generals...How do I begin?  Maybe with saying that the name has no relevance what -so-ever to the game. This game looks good (sort of), but don-'t be fooled please. Please don-'t play it. I-'ll tell you why you shouldn-'t play it. It-'s for your own benefit. And don-'t watch the cinematic-♥♥♥ trailors because the game looked nothing like them.The combat in the game abosulely sucks. Fights are won by the person who has: payed the most money, has the luckier hit hitection (the hit reg is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and who has the better ping. That-'s it.I love it how it says at the botton of the game-'s description -Wars aren-'t won by tanks alone-. *face palm* ALL I GET KILLED BY IS ♥♥♥♥ING TANKS! Oh, and the guys who have paid for planes and 1 shot kill sniper rifles. You might say -well what about the panzerfaust moron-. Well the panzerfaust is just ♥♥♥♥ing impossible to use and the tank always sees me before I can get a shot.I recently purchased the M1903 which took ♥♥♥♥ing ages to get. But i can-'t even use it because I get killed every 5 seconds.The game is unrealistic beyond measure. People take way too many bullets. The M1903 that costs 92,000 of the currency, is still a 3 shot kill to the body, like the default! So what-'s the point? You can walk around as a russian with an anti-take rifle that weighs 17kg and fires .60 calibre rounds and shoot it while standing up. Come the ♥♥♥♥ on. This game is not truly free. Games rarely are. Just get a paid game that-'s fun and avoid free games if you can. I was unsure how to write this.
Basically can't play anymore because I am high leveled and I keep getting killed by people who have 'better' guns and armour that I can do nothing about. Does this seriously mean I am expected to pay for GC, I mean seriously you get less AC the higher level you are.
