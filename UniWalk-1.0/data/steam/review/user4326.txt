all though on this acc i only have 250 hours on this game gives you an expierence like no other i will never value a game more then this one on my old acc i had nearly 2k hours on it when i get really old andhave great grandchildren ill tell emi remember the good old days when i was young i use to play good old fnv it was like my soulmate all you young whipersnappers do now is play arround in your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ spaceships and your virtual simulations it was a better time back thento a great piece of art
this is a awesome beutyful game that has a great point spoiler alert! it has a very sad ending
