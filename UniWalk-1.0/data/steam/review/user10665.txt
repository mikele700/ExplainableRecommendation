Great game, would recommend to those who wished dayz was better, great gameplay and gets spooky in some places.
Possibly the -gayest- game ever... literally the sight of a sausage fest wobbling around gives me the shivers.  10/10 would go 3rd person and look at the sun again :P
Great game... other then the fact that i spent 1.5hrs trying to bomb Japan not knowing i had to research basic bombs XD
