[WARNING THIS GAME IS EARLY ACCESS YES THERE ARE BUGS DEAL WITH IT, THE POINT OF EARLY ACCESS IS SO THE DEVELOPER'S CAN GET AS MUCH FEED BACK AS POSSIBLE BEFORE REALEASING IT COMPLETLEY]Alright  now that thats out of the way let me get into the review, this is a pretty solid game especially for trek [ the makers of Orion dino beat down and Orion prelude] who have brought out some bad and some good games. what i like a about trek is that they capitilize on there mistakes and come back stronger and listen to the comunity now i have only played this game for about 10 hours and i still have yet to scratch the surface of this game.PROS:Nice graphicsTwo view points [third person and top down] with first person coming soonsoon to be a fully explorable galaxya few classes to level up and get used to[ more on the way]listens to the players [for example they had a poll to see what players like, disliked and wanted]Cons:i dont know if this is for everyone but sometimes i will have a long load time [mostly fixed in the latest update]fps drops [almost completely fixed with the latest update]________________________________________________________________________________alright so in the space of a day after me getting this game they have released an update that has made the ui and hud alot better in my opinion however some people dont agree mostly because the ui is so simplified compared to the old one and alot of people seem to hate the white background on the menu's but really your complaining about a whit background that is only on the menu's damn while they have worked hard to put out smoother perfomance and a bit better animation for third person your biggest problem is a white background, why? they will most likely remove this but its not that big of a deal stop going physco over it honestly trek and the other companies are working hard to dish out first person vehicles and so forth they even said after they latest update they can begin working on the first person module. oh and one last thing this game cost's a dollar, soon there will be open world maps open galaxies to explore and so forth for $1 and battlefront cost's how much? thats just a reskin of battlefield with characters that you can pick up. anyways sorry for the long review but overall this game is amazing so far and i cant wait for the new and upcoming updates keep up the good work trek. but again srs complaining over a white background??? yet they give you alot more and personally like the bobbing in third person so please guys stop complaining they a working hard for us and they have most likley realised that mistake and will fix it in the next update just calm down.
Tribes, tribes was amazing until hi rez stopped work on it i will always remember this as my favorite game when i was younger i hope they revive this soon past 10/10 now 1/10 EDIT somewhat revived
