This game is amazing. The fact that this was made by a 16 year old blows my mind. Everything is perfect except for a few things but in sure they will be changed later on. 2 things I just want to say is that: 1. Please make world saves. 2. Please make cars run out of fuel slower than what they do. Other than that i love this game and i recommend you to get it.
