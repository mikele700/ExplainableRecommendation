A mix of DayZ with a Minecraft look. Runs really easily, plays really good now and can't wait till the full game is made.
One of the best simplistic, fast paced games ever. With a kung-fu fighting stickman style this is a game bound to give you RSI (repetitive strain injury) and alot of time wasted. Thumbs up. Plus I've had way more hours in this game somewhere else.
