As far as early access games go, I have to say you want to jump on board this one as soon as possible. Graphics, Gameplay, level design and even well designed AI make this game a hell of a good BETA. It will leave you with generally only one main complaint, and thats content.Now of course content will be lacking in an early access title, but grip has managed to create an experience where, even though there is only three maps for racing at the moment, each race will leave you with a different opinoin. This is thanks to level design, incorporating the abillity to drive up walls, take side paths (both of which are usually drasticly different) and landing good items and benefital positions.The Kaos of the race, explosions everywhere while you narrowly avoid rocks and ramps wizzing past you, while dust sprays from the back of your tires all the while trying to keep an eye out of the player infront of you, makes this game really really fun. If you apreciate the intencity of a race, this is perfect for youLong story short, you will pick up this game thinking -This game has so much potential-, and at this rate, I think it would be pretty hard to screw up.
