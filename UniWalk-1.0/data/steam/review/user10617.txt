X-com is one of the best strategy based games!First time I played, I could never get off the game. The charactor development in this game is really good, you get to choose what they look like and develop your soldiers class tree.
This game is too overated!Do not get this game because it is really crap in all ways!OMG!
One of the best 3D survival games, still adding a few things but really fun to play, cuffing people and stealing their stuff or killing them is really fun.One of the things I hate is that when you die you lose your stuff so I could have spent a day getting good stuff and getting to a certain spot and then I die either from a zombie or most likely from a person.
This game you will have awesome fun!There is different game modes like: Survival, Roleplay and in single player its sandbox witch then you can mess around a little bit!
This is the best zombie game ever!Everyone should get this game
