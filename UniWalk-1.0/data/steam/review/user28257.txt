Haha, Oh man.. This is a game I will always remember. You want a short review on this game? Alrighty, I should be able to give you one, I-'ve played this game plenty, just, not on steam.Granted, I-'ve not played this game in quite some time, but there is one thing you must understand: Elite Moderaters. They are either going to be your best friend, or, they-'ll be some punk two year old, that is crying over the fact that -YOU SON OF A ♥♥♥♥♥, YOU-'RE USING A DAMN SHOTGUN! GTFO!- with the message of -You-'ve been kicked out of the match by the Elite Moderater.- The game has a bit of a... History, with Hackers. I don-'t know if they-'ve fixed that, but for some time, Elite Mods were Nexon-'s way to deal with it. MOST of the community however, if you were in a normal game lobby, dispised the hacker as much as you did, and wouldn-'t hesitate to vote kick his ♥♥♥ out.
10/10 GAME went in multiplayer joined a game got knifed :D
