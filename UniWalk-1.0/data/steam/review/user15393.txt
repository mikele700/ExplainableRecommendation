This game is in early alpha stages, it is laggy and the graphics suck!BUT i bought this game and i LOVED it, its the idea that makes it good the feeling of opening a door and a zombie jumps out and scares the ♥♥♥♥ out of you. I love it, and its in alpha wich means it can only get better so buy it now before it gets finished and the price goes up!
