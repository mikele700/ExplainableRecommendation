Well time to relive my youth with advanced gameplay and graphics.I dont care what anyone says, The campaign is old school doom in a modern format.....and playing it gives me that raw power and exhilaration kinda feel that a FPS should give you. So far I have had no glitches, no tearing and no issues with the gameplay and that spells to me that ID and Bethesda have released a solid product. This is something that most new releases cant do.The finished product is polished, fast paced and fun....and be warned if you stand still for more than 2 seconds on the nightmare setting, you WILL die.On saying that I do have a coupel of small negatives, the Music gets very repetitive very fast and the fact that they have released a DLC at such a ridiculous price, just to make extra money does not sit well for me.The multiplayer also lacks matchmaking balance, as a Lvl 1 player I was matched against a team with a lvl30, a lvl26 and 4 level 19 players. Our team had 3 lvl1, a level 9, a level 11 and a level 21 player. Hardly seems fair in the scheme of things.The MP also will get very repetitive very fast but the range of gametypes is nice.I will add to this once I have also had some experience with snapmap, but its certainly looks like a great part of an exceptional game already.
Well I have been waiting a very long time since the first Wolfenstein, and its so been worth the huge gap.This game is the bomb, from a gritty narative storyline, to superb graphics and fantastic gameply.This has got to be one of the gaming highlights of the year for any FPS gamer...seriously.
Well for $4.99 its a laugh, reminds me of the Omen Movies....there is something kinda fun roaming around and killing people as a 6 year old kid....lolGraphics are great for an Indie game, storyline short but intense, kinda game you play on a widescreen monitor in the dark.
WOW...just WOW...even if you dont like Tomb Raider, this is a must. A Masterpiece of cinematography and gameplay.
