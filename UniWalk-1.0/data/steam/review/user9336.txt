Disconnecting Simulator 2016, enjoy your stay!
This Game is cheap and is a whole lot of fun, it has the dynamics of minecraft mixed with a First Person Shooting to keep you wanting more. My favorite game-mode is Zombie where you can choose to be a Survivor or Zombie (note: there is only one Zombie to start with) then the Survivor's can build constructions using block and can scavenge more blocks by using their pickaxe or shovel to break blocks and collect them. The whole aim is to either kill as many people as possible if you are a zombie or survive the longest and kill some Zombie's along the way. For people that like mincraft and like the first person shooter edge put onto it then this is the game for you and I highly Recommend you try it out.
Okay, so i first played this initially on PS3 back when it was first released. I found it hard to get into and sort of put it down and didn't go back to it, then I saw a sale on steam and the saints row collection was dirt cheap. I bought it and started playing it, I then released how good and how much fun this game really is. For the small amount of money that you pay to get this game when its on sale, it is very much worth it. The game has some odd jokes dropped here and there that is really smart and makes you laugh, some of the things that go on within the game are quiet funny and some can be challenging so it brings two things together really well, in being funny and challenging at the same time. I also have played this game for a number of other hours offline when i didn't have internet connection available for a few days so there is a few hours missing from the playtime. I also plan on perfecting this in the near future because i just enjoyed it so much.
