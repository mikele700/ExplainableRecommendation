Ok, i know this game has already been reviewed a ♥♥♥♥ tonne, but imma do this anyways.This game is... just... you know? i have no idea how to describe it in one word, but i can describe it with a sentence as consolation.its hotwheels, that can jump. combined with soccer. and HOLY **** is it fun!I-'ve played this game majority with friends, and even in the darkest situations, even when we are getting hammered, it is STILL fun. although, there was a situation with matchmaking a few days ago, were it matched us against -Masters- and -Elite- level players. and my god are they goodmy point is, if you and your friends want a new, enjoyable game. i highly recommend Rocket League.
