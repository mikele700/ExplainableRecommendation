this game is very good apart from some servers being abit laggy and sometimes takes a while to load but apart from that it is a good game. very fun
this is the most fun game ever 320 no scope
this game is really bad the set up lvl is stupid. Even after 10 mins i thiught that this game sucked. So, really, if you want to waste money than this is the game for you.
Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is one of the best games i have ever played. i has all sorts of maps from hill climbs to freefallers. the one thing that i dont like about it though is the tilting but thats just me. All that aside it is a really good game. 90/100
this game is a good game even though the updats and download are big they dont take long. good fun game. :D
best jc ever so many things you can do
This game is a very good game for all ages. it dose not make anyone of any age feel like their ;eft out. Although the missions a fair =ly long but hay, thats lego games. One thing i found a little bit anyoing was the fact that free roam had to be unlocked; its unlocked after you finish the story but still it would be nice. This game is a game well worth what you pay for it. 9/10
very very laggy the co-op is not very good but it is still an ok game
