10/10 Would report a race of pinoys again
If you lovely developers could somehow cleanse this game from spammers, then this game would dethrone smash bros.
Man, this game is pretty nice, but I dont like it. Matchmaking is terrible and feels unfair. Every match I had is joined by at least 2 level 30 players and high ranked mechs. The newbs and I didnt have any idea about dealing with them, our mechs are still S***! l337/10 would get ridiculously rekt by veterans again.
The redux made this awesome game EVEN better basicly. Although the game is linear the story is much worth it.
Do you like arma but hate arma? Do you like BF but hate BF? Are you confused yet? good.
