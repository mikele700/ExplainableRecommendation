I can-'t believe I nearly didn-'t buy this game because of the negative reviews... so here-'s mine:-It works on my -low-end, doesn-'t even scrape in the reccomended specs- computer smoothly-It has improved character customisation-The dynamic colour scheme makes the map look amazing-The build system is a great new addition-Companions are far better in combat and more interesting to talk to-The perk system is easy to get the hang of-The voicing of the protagonist is fitting and adds to the cinematics of the game-Dogmeat returns.9.5/10 because it-'s pretty dang good.
This game is probably one of the most realistic games of this year.The graphics in this game are amazing, so crisp and surreal. The physics are probably the most impressive aspect of the game, being so true to nature. Even the music for this game was amazing, I felt inspired by it. The characters were in depth and felt like they were real, and the goat aspect was brilliant.Overall I would rate this game 10/10 for amazing gameplay.
this game is a mind♥♥♥♥ i love it
