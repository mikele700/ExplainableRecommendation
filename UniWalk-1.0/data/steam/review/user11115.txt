I havent played this game for as long as i would like but this game is very good for a game that came out in 2006. The graphics arent the best but the gameplay is great. This game runs on any peice of crap which is great. This game also brings lots of nastolgia.
Great game! Not pay to win in any way, gameplay is great and im glad that this came to steam.
Game is fun at first but then when you reach the highest world for 1 character it gets boring. I saved enough for another character. Got that to highest world in atleast 20 minutes.At first this game is very fun and enjoyable but it gets too repetitive.
This game was good when more people played it. Now it takes atleast 5-10mins to find a match. I have spent $50 on this game and regret it because of the lack of players.
