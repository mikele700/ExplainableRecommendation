Game honestly suprised me on how fun it could be.Yep the game is rough being early access but nothing bad. Melee combat feels abit sluggy could use more workIf you enjoy complex crafting its got that tooHavent explored all the map yet but it is beautiful.Community is friendly.Game runs well on max settings on my Computer, but i got a GTX980 and a i7 4790k so i guess i can't talk.Lag is a issue.Only buy if you dont care about spending the $20. But would recommend keeping a eye out for this one when development gets better.Some positive number/10 would kill a Viking while singing ave maria again
Worth buying just for the Emotes
your a soft ♥♥♥♥ if you dont buy it
