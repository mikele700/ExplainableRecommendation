Skyrim, to me Skyrim is one of the best games I had ever played. I had a hard time picking which races to play as, I eventually pick a race called -Nord- and I finish the game with this race.Storyline: To me Skyrim-'s storyline was every: interesting, different and truly difficult in many ways. But, the storyline could have more detail, in my opinon.Also the storyline, to me was so long which I liked because later, in the game I understand, what it was trying to say or relate to.Characters: This game, has many -different- characters such as: crazy, happy, mad and sad. Game of Skyrim made this so we can relate this to the our world... Which to I was enjoyable that the makers of this game put lots affect in the game to make it more real like.Followers: I loved the idea that there was followers in the game like: Dogs, Horses, Wife, Husband and NPC (Humans). It made it like you won-'t alone or afriad and that you could go in the deepest of caves, ruins or something like that.I, Recommend this game to all my friend because its fun, interesting and a lot different to other games...
