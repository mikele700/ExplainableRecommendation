I am... usually ot one to review most video games.But, Holy ♥♥♥♥... This game...This game is kinda what happens when you try to murder people -You-'re gonna have a bad time-But, I recently heard about Genocide run and I honestly, refuse to do it.Because the charecters feel genuine and it makes you not want to kill them.There are so many factors to this game (Which i am too lazy to cover) such as the soundtrack, gameplay, story... Honestly, At first, I thought I would not like this game.But, as always I was wrong.
Bioshock Infinite review,What can I say? This game pushed the boundries of the original bioshock, literally. From a city under the sea, to a city in the sky. This game was simply amazing. A private detective named Booker Dewwit has been involed in a indebting with the wrong people, so, he is sent by them to find a girl named 'Elizabeth' who has been trapped in the city in the sky. (AKA. Colombia). Booker soon finds out that this is no ordanariy job, but in fact, something above his standards (Pun intended). As he explores the town of colombia, The backstory of the founder (Zachary Hale Comestuck), and every single barrel and garbage bin for coins and food. He soon finds out that there is a man who is called the 'False Shepard', an enemy to colombia. as you go deeper into the city you find out that the 'false shepard' has a sort of signiture for himself, two initials  on the back of his hand spelling A.D. Which to his suprize are the excact same initials Booker has on the back of his hand.The game always keeps you guessing from the start, and even to the end. With the genres switching from an action to a sort of horror. With reacurring enimies with increaced difficulty. And what bioshock is best at, The twists.This is one of the most enjoyable and mysterious games i have ever played with as little flaws as possible. I would reccomend it to anyone who asks me about it.I give it a 9.5/10
Just like Portal 3 except this game came out.
