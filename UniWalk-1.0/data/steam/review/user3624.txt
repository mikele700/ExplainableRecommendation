Do not buy, simple. Even if this was in the bargain bin for $5. It is not worth it.Sadly Sean oversold the game as a yes-man in interviews. Again, do not buy.And Steam should do the right thing by refunding disregarding their return policy.
Day of Infamy - pure awesome, game reminds me of the days of Wolfenstein Return to Castle or Enemy Territory.It's good to have a FPS that is basic and not running along walls or retro looking skins to stand out...Will be recommending this game as you really do get your bang for buck!
its good
Don't waste your money. I bought this game when it was on sale because I knew I would get screwed over but not to this degree. Very predictable once you get past the honeymoon stage when the excitement quickly runs out....Now Beastman is $15 and blood is $2 (AUD)Game in total honestly is around $20 inc all DLC etc....
It's fun
Good game
