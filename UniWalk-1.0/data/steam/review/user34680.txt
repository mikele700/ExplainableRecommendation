An awesome open world where you do whatever the hell you want. You can do the main quest, do sidequests, or heck, do no quests at all and just kill loads of bandits and forsworn! The characters are flexible: you are not restricted to a specific playstyle as your characters skills level up as you use them.LOADS of content, and if you get the DLC, LOADS MORE content!Overall, fastastic game. When this game is on sale, it is DEFINITELY worth your money!
