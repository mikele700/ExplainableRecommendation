Loved it, drawing my bow for 4 seconds as the enemies emptied their clips into me, reloaded and emptied them again before I fired 1 arrow and missed.8 seconds later and 1 down, thankfully rescued by my teammate we did it all again, I even got a kill that game!With the Javelin, which is pretty badass, just wish there was 5 or 6, instead of 3, seems a bit useless since there are so few.Love the masks! have to say they are the Pro of this DLC.
