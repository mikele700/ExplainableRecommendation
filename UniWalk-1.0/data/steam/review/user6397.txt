HOW IS THIS GAME FREE WHEN YOU NEED TO PAY TO PLAY THE F@#KING THING? WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF YOU PUT IT UP FOR A PRICE AND PEOPLE BUY TO PLAY THE WHOLE GAME -_-
A great game to play with friends really gotta work on the teamwork to wind the hard battles
its a good game but alot of bugs and even when i put everything on LOW still lags... i suggest anyone thinking of buying this game to hold back until a few issues are fixed
