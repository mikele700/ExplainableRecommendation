Free to play and Extremely fun, in my opinion this is the Diablo 3 everyone was waiting for, Free to play games usually mean there is some form of P2W but PoE handles it very well, there is no Pay to win at all, this game is great if your expereinced with Action RPG's or not, the graphics are not so silly and realistic like, takes a dark and gloomy feel to the player! The Skill tree is very large and you can go anywhere with any class, the progression and class development is very flexible, by the end of the game you can be a FireRanger Tank if you felt like it!This game is by far my most Favourite Action RPG, I play it over TL2 or D3 anyday, and it's free! Give it a try, it will be worth your time if you call yourself a gamer!
Not my Favourite game in the Series, It has some nice features which make the game unique different to the rest, but the only area this game falls is that the PC Version lacks the features at which the PS4 and Xbox One have, making the maps for PC feeling empty and just a waste.Good game if your a strong Call of duty fan :)
Adventure/action FPS that ♥♥♥♥♥ on the rest! This game is a great singleplayer experience! :)
Co-op horror game, amazing fun! Recommened with a group of 3+ people!
Awesome FPS, playable by anyone, Free to play, no such thing as Pay too win and suits any gamer! :)
