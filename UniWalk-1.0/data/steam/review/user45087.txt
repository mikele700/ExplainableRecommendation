This game is great! Especially once you develop a massive army, slay everything with dragons, get extraordinarily powerful heroes... I'm getting carried away. The sense of accomplishment and success that you get once you take out another medival kingdom is the best and makes you want to play it even more. You must get it! The only bad thing is if you are not a patient and willing to work for the things you want this is probably not for you...
