If you are like me, then you have an insatiable hunger for power that can only be relieved through the repression of smaller countries and cultures. Europa Universalis IV satisfies all the reqirements a fledgling dictator will need in his/her rise to ultimate power:- shrewed economic management;- diplomatic prowess;- military genius; and- the complete disregard of natives and cultures not of your own.If you are worried about constraints, fear not! Europa Universalis IV is freeform with no story line; your destiny is your own. Do you want to start an early Fourth Reich? Do you want the first non-natives in America to be Japanese? Do you want to finish what Napoleon could not? Form an alternate earth and marvel at the wonder you created.Though it has a very steep learning curve (which can be flattened by watching walkthroughs), Europa Universalis IV is a must have for any power hungry strategy buff.
