Really good game, had me hooked after the first 10 minutes!
Very fun game, recommend for allmost anyone that likes FPS.Keeps you hooked with HOURS of gameplay, and with GOTY edition it never ends.Everyone wants good gear, so you take your time to search every chest and room.No problems with the game or multiplayer.Recommend for everybody, awesome game, cant go wrong.
