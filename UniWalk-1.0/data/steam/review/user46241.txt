i owned alot of the games for total war on disks whilst playing shogun 2 i find it quite enjoyable maybe not as enjoyable as rome 2 but it is definitly i great addition to the series with both graphics and gameplay wise with bigger battles and really captures the realism of the battlesthe only draw back is it does not have powerful modding capibilities thus if you are looking for mods such as the lotr tw or warhammer they aren't really avaliableall in all its a great game and definately worth the buy
