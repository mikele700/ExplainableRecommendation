This game is great.Not only for the survival aspect but for the way the structures work and look.I think this game has great potential in the near future and the developers have already started adding new items in.This game is also great when playing in a group of atleast two but is still fun when playing solo.I only have one problem in this game and that is the people who shoot on site.I can understand that you kill them if they have some kind of gear that you know they have and you need to survive or if you truly feel that they are a threat to your life but if they have lower gear than you and they havn't seen you or are running away then what is the point in shooting ?I have seen the wotk thatthe developers have done on the Devblog and cant wait till it is added into the game.
