I walked into a stranger's house at 4 in the morning, woke him up and we drank about 12 beers. He then gave me a book.Pretty good I guess.
The least pay-to-win game I've played.
This is a must for $5 (if you're reading this while the steam sale is on), or $20. Either way this game is very fun and addicting, mainly the reason why is the destruction. Seeing a huge building come crumbling down is satisfying and rewarding. BUY IT!
If you're looking for a realistic, army shooter game, this is the game for you!And hey, It's free! so give it a try.
