no matches, lovely...
Challenging, very relentless gameplay. Trust me when I say it isn't for the weak hearted or the easy-goers.... This is what I like to call a really f#$%ing hard game. But give it a shot, you may find you like it...
GOT BANNED FOR NAY REASON
It's straight up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, too many scrubs using the same ♥♥♥♥ing weapons.
Won't run :(
You've turned my frown upside down!
You know, whilst it could be oh so much better, (it has next to no ideas put in,) it is fun! Would not recommed it to CS:GO players.
Crap, just... crap. Good models though...
