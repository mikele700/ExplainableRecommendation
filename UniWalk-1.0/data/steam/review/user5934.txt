Awesome adventure game. Great puzzles, fights and the best of all are the graphics, the graphics are sooooooo amazing. i took soo many screenshots. Plus the little secret items n books scatter all around made it fun to search for and the background stories arre interesting. Anyway overall great game, althought the movement control is not sooo great but still good. it made me miss afew jumps though. I would rate this game 8/10
it's a great fun co-op game that can be enjoyed by friends or familu. its funky weird characters and stages make the game much more interesting. 9/10
I have no idea what is game or what is it really about, but i love it. it's soo peaceful. just sitting backlooking at the mountain spin while you play some music that suits the mood and so nice. Just for some reason it puts me at ease. 10/10 Best game ever.
This game is very uummm..... how do I say...... Interesting!! This is a extremely fun game to play with your friends, it allows you to be creative and to troll your friends with that creativity. Garry's mod is a limitless game, it allows you to do stuff even minecraft can't do! Although there are those people online who take some stuff too seriously unlike TF2 (Check it out), that is why it is better to play with your friends but playing online with other people is not so bad
This game is unique. It is like bringing a MMORPG to a FPS game and it is amazing!! The way valve design this game is brilliant, every class and weapon has it's own strength and weaknesses. Plus adding things such as taunts and hats makes it more fun and hilarious. But the most amazing thing about TF2 is that you can be an idiot or a fool and no one will get mad!! Even sometimes people will be a idiot with you! It is a game nothing like COC or Rift, It is a legit fun game where you can laugh your ♥♥♥ off and never get bored especially with friends. I highly recommend it!!
