I love this game, i dont see why all these people are complaining about it crashing, its obviously something wrong on your end, it did not crash a single time when i finished downloading it or when my cousin started it up to, it ran perfectly fine first try, it runs fine as well, it only crashed a few times after me playing it for hours and hours so that is understandable, its a fun game and i love it, and btw, the people saying that they lied about it being multiplayer, no they did not lie, it has multiplayer features is what they said, and it is possible to see each other, its just next to 0% chance for that to happen tho, and those guys on ps4, that tried to meet up, the ps4 servers were really busy because of the amount of people playing, thats probably why they couldnt see each other, so stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing, get over it, its a great game and it is exactly how it is meant to be, i played it for 17 hours on the first day and im still loving it.
