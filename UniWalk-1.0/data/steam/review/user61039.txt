Would definitely reccomend this. The mechs, fast paced action, sweet enviroments, and awesome shadowing which blankets its minimalist approach to textures are what makes this game amazing. The only thing its missing...people! I'll be at the menu screen going through all the regions and theres only 1 server between all of them. I don't think I've played enough yet to rate it but at the moment it seems to be one of the most exciting games I have played.
The most unique game I've seen out there. Want to make a giant robot that is on fire and shoots lazers. I bet you have, and with all the parts, ragdolls, and tools in the game, plus mods you can download automatically from the menu, you can totally make it. And with some ridiculous game modes in multiplayer like Trouble in Terrorist Town and Deathrun, its sure to be a fun game.
All I've got to say about this game is that it is, probably one of the funniest first person shooters out there, right next to TF2. Well that isnt all I have to say. If your looking for a game with almost UNLIMITLESS types of guns this is the game for you. And with the weapon slots you unlock through the game you can have a Sniper, Rifle, Rocket Launcher, Pistol and Shotgun on you at the same time without making you slow like most other games would. Plus the fact that some guns when you reload them you throw them away into an enemy and it explodes. So to sum it all up, Great Game
