The kid played for 15 min. Fell off map, narrator said to be more careful, fell off again. The kid decided walking off the side of the map was a bad idea. Finally reached the Bastion, the kid flew to a new district, the kid found a sword, the sword was cool, the kid went to bed at 4am happy with his life decisions
Here is an accurate tutorial on how to play. Play for a few hours and begin to get bored. Suddenly a new weapon appears! Use it because you think its the best weapon ever. Start to get bored again. Suddenly a hat appears! Wear this hat as everyone calls you names like -gibus- and -noob- (they just jealous of your amazing hat). Suddenly 100 hours of gameplay! Watch as you become a friendless hermit who scrap banks 24/7. Suddenly 100+ hours of -gameplay-! Watch as the game went from playing it to gaining hats and stranges and watch how your social life slowly dies. 11/10 pretty hats.
Haven't played too many hours of this but i've started and i love it. My original thoughts would be that this game would have very little depth and gameplay elements but BOY, I WAS WRONG! This game is awesome and full of great entertaining content with a variety of classes each with their own special abilities. Currently is in alfa but i have to say it feels like a complete game. Got killed by a gingerbread man wielding a lollipop 10/10 IGN WOULD PLAY AGAIN! But srs play it pls n have instant fun.
I've been playing for about 5 days now and this game is amazing! No glitches, great fun graphics and a huge array of weapons to find. The crafting is deep and challenging and I find a great sense of achievement as I progress. The zombies are a real threat as well, one moment your peacefully searching for berries and the next you are surrounded by hordes of flesh eating monsters. All in all this game is immense, well made, updated regularly and full of atmosphere. Definetly a 10/10!
