Okay, so when people think of adventure what do they imagine? They will usually think about killing stuff with swords -'n lazers and stuff, Terraria is exactly like that but... in 2D and it has squares, do you like squares????? Nice because this game has a lot of them. The story of this game starts with NOTHING, because this game has no story, it just drops you in the middle of a world you must exploit to survive and live... and kill.... and do some other...stuff.The main objective of the game is to kill -The Wall of Flesh- (That is exactly what it is: a wall made of flesh), and when you do it you unlock the HARD mode, if you alredy thought this game was troubling you, prepare yourself, because it was just warming up.In general this is a good game,  has nice music, appealing graphics (at least for the type of game it is (a 2D pixel adventure/sandbox)), it also it-'s very easy to understand how to play, has some really useful NPC-'s aaaaand also there is a  Dr.Who reference (BOWTIES ARE COOL). Terraria is a game i recommend for people that like 2D sandbox/adventure titles, or just whoever it-'s intrested.
