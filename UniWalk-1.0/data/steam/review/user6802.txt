This might not seem like much of a interesting game, but it really sucked me in. I found myself spending hours trying to make an awesome game... And hating the reviews if they didn't like it after I spent time trying to balance it right.
It makes me moist. If for some reason anyone didn't own this game, they need to spend less time watching porn and get it.
