Now I'm not a big VN fan, but boy did this get me keen. Tanks + Girls. What more could a man want? The way the girls describe the various parts of their bodies as parts of tanks is hilarious. This game is also very funny, every minute there's some sort of funny line either as a tank related pun or just a political joke, even the phonetic translations crack me up.Love this game 10/10, though it is more appealing if you either have a passion for tanks or better yet World War II.
