well first off i highly reccomend this game way to much fun and super addicting u are gonna want to keep on playing after u first play it never gets old or boring
One of the best games i have ever played this game is going down in my books for one of the best story games ever this game was so well thought and planned out the storyline really keeps making you get more and more curious this is a must have for all Telltale fans
its a great game don't get me wrong but it was actually way better until zombies were taken out and replaced with mutant wolf and bears
really great game and its only still in beta form but its really addictive and you will not get tired of playing this game i found it really fun and a chalenge at the same time i highly recommend this game
