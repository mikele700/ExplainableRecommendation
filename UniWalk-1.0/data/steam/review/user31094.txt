Painkiller Hell & Damnation is nothing like the original. I would often forget I was playing a Painkiller game and think it was Serious Sam, hence no story line just masses of enemies waiting to get blown to pieces. As a fps run and gun its quite entertaining and fun. The sound tracks are good, and the graphics quit appealing. So if your looking for mindless carnage with a heavy metal score this is the game for you.
