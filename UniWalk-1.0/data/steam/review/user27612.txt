I first started playing this MMORPG back in 2008 when it was first released and sure the graphics weren-'t so good back then but the community was great. Even though it lacked in some areas but made up for in others. The class system aka -Job- was clean cut and clear as how to where to do this and that, there are plenty of party quest and hard dungeons that make a party important, each class compliments each other. Customizable races are also pretty fun to muck around with at the beginning like making little Sprites have big ti... AHEM, MOVING ON! The game provides many challenges to take on, which can take you on adventures from one to place to another. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, how could I forget the pet system, the pets are absolutlely adorable, though the down side is that they take like a million years to level up BUT when you do manage to hit level 61 for the pet and mount it, I guess it sort of makes it worth while having an amazing pet. Honestly, when this game shut down, I really thought this was the end for such an amazing game, there were plenty fo bugs to be fixed but it was still great none the less, but to be re-released AND TO BE ON STEAM, it-'s like a dream come true.
Cute chibi knights bouncing around, slashing and hacking their way through enemies left, right, up and down with only one goal in mind... To make out with the princess but of course, there is a price to be paid, once you-'ve reached the princess, you must battle your fellow comrade till the last man standing. I recommend that you play with a team of 4, there are also mini-games like -All you can quaff- which is all about who can button mash the fastest. Very enjoyable game, plenty of achievements to obtain and plenty of steam cards to collect.
