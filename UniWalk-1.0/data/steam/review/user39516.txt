This game means so much to me that I cannot really describe it in just words to do it justice.All I can say is I am glad we finally did it guys congrats.Now it is up to the newbies.For me this has been oh so much more than just a long 16 years, oh so much more.Long live Subspace Continuum and all the bests for its future.iyui/AlienC signing out.peace
Great game to play with a new friend or even a stranger you just met the other day.. would co op with a random again.Warning though: Some parts of the game may cause sever uncontrollable anger management issues hehe lol.. be prepared to rage.. lol
