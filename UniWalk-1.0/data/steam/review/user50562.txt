good game so far i found a glitch on start with models they are messing up but ima find a way to fix it no lag running on medium with intel gpu/cpu thats really awsome and im useing intel core i3 and hd 4000 so its amazing good gameplay but if you find glitches feel free to add me i can try to help you with that because remember this game is in early access and if your gonna buy a game like this your gonna find bugs overall ill have to rate it 8/10 have fun guys =D
overall good game mabey is has been ported a little bad but hey look rockstar aint perfect :) also with windows 7 it works better and if you have intel you might have some problems such as broken models/textures but i mean your going to need a dedicated gpu anywase to run it the way they attended :) overall 10/10 the devs really stepped up their game the year of release and im proud of that if your looking for a game where you can run people over with them on your wind shield or let them hold onto your car door while you drive OR if you just love ragdolls and good physics you have found the right game :D so if you see anything i listed in this comment that you would like in a game i Suggest you buy this game :)
all i have to say is holy ♥♥♥♥ if you dont like this game your a ♥♥♥♥ and shouldnt be games its original old release and most of all FUN ILL GIVE IT 100% RATING THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL YOU WONT LIKE THIS GAME  BUY IT :D
