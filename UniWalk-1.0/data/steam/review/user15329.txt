State of Decay has many high and low points. this versitile world gives many options such as to change the location of your home base from taking down large proportions of the infected. Even if i found the campaign on the short side, you can either buy the DLC Breakdown to get a couple extra hours in or just not do the final mission. This zombie survival game has many things that i look for in most games, even if its coated in large scale bugs.So in short, if you enjoy having a busy schedule and choosing different varients of tasks whilst having fun. go ahead.
Played for 3 hours, had a female stalker who danced for me, fished for level 40 items, never died due to cheap potions, fought my stalker and lost to stalker and bacame friends with her... would do again
