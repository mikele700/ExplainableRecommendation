â–¸ I immediately regret my decision
Gimme an epic upvote if this game and Starbound taught you to never buy early access again.
Don-'t buy this, not even for the 50c price it is often on sale for. It-'s not -so bad it-'s good-. It-'s just thoroughly unfun.
Aimbots everywhere, pay2win, ugly, laggy, generic.
okay so uh I just like got a preorder of this game after Reddit recomended it........ am I missing something.......?? this is just like a ripoff of LOL. all the heroes are just copys..? the champions are boring and unfunny and have no personalitys. and having all the champs at the start instead of having to pay 4 them........... uh news flash its a little overwelming to a newbie.... i just dont get what people see in it its just sad rly
This game is hilarious, and the developer has an infectious passion for his product. Highly recommended.
Gets old fast. Not worth $10.
