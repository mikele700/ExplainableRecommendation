Listen,When I was 13 years old (im 15 now) I abosoLUTELY adored this game so much potential and just a great game but that was during the time when it had a free-to-play week and I just loved it over 1000 people were on SO many servers great community great game but then the Free-To-Play was taken off from then it died down slowly and slowly and nobody played it anymore so I stopped now I can remember this game and 2 years I came back to it but I decided not to come back to it since it said last timed I play was september 2013 and I want to keep it like that cause that is when it died to the fullest  and the devs stopped working on it so that really sucks.RIP Showdown Effect2013 - 2013We will all miss you
