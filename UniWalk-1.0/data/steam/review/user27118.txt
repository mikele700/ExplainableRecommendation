YE
If you're looking for a dark fps shooter this isnt the game for you, i loved it. -10/10-ign
Brilliant
It's a good game, hitboxes could use a little fine tuneing but aside from that this game works and runs quite well, It has good mechanics for both running, and hiding. Verdict - 8/10
Good Game.
Good game, junk port
Great adventure exploration game, with a load of replay-ability
