Having just finished the fifth and final episode - -Vault of the Traveller- all I can say is.... Oh wow that was a ride. Having played each episode as it came out, my anticipation between each release was high, and in my mind, Telltale made the anticipation all worth it.Normally, here-'s the part where I would say that the 4th episode, being the penultimate chapter used to set up the finale was on the weak side. This was not the case this time around, as I felt it was just as strong as the rest of the story.Would I recommend this game to Borderlands fans? YesWould I recommend this game to Telltale fans? YesWould I recommend this game to anyone who asked about it? Yes
Such a fun game with a great sense of humor and no small amount of references. It has a deeper story then what first appears, and the characters are fun... except that little girl. Damn her.
