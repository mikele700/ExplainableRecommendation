Cheap, fun little game that has a cool art style. you should pick it up while its on sale for 2.99
I have nearly 3 hours on Killing Floor 2 so far. It has been the best game experience for a new release I've had in over 6 months, and its not even finished yet. If you're wondering if you should buy this game, the answer is yes. Killing Floor 2 expands upon the original game in every way and refines the experience (Still miss the trader lady though). Tip: To take out the Boss, just spam grenades and unload all of the ammo of the AA12 into his face.10/10 (So far)
