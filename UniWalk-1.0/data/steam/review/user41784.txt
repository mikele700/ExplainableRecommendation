Lost what I thought was my best friend to it. All he does now is csgo and it made me do so too. I've been suffering mentally and physically now and I always wished we never played this game. tl;dr the game's addicting, it made me lose someone I loved and made me lose myself. It's your choice to play but never forget there is more to this beautiful world than CSGO.
