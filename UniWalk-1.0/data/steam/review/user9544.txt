Awesome game, just finished it. Now to be honest some missions are a bit repetative and boring, but there are also AWESOME missions so yeah. Fav mission (Kinda SPOILER ALERT) is the metal gear solid reference that has you hidding in boxes, so many references so little time. (now i have to go and buy all the dlc :P)Anyway great game and suggest getting it 4/5
