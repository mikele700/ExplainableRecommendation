I personally love this game. It's so fun and intense, every match does feel like I'm in a horror film and I f*ckin love it.Yes there are bugs with matchmaking, there are some things that still need to be ironed out but at its core it works and it's fun. This is a very great start and the developers are clearly driven to keep updating and improving the game, they're very involved with the community and they have weekly twitch streams which I highly reccomend checking out. I personally would urge anyone to buy it, I get if it's not everyone''s cup of tea but it's a fun, fast-paced game.
