Education about guns taking apart guns and assembling them again. Great game for people who are big into guns, so therefore I rate this game...... 7/10 recommend this to my friends and random people
DAY - 1 -I spawned in a cold area with very few dinos. Decided to chop some wood with my fists. First chop on the tree and I died. 10/10 would play again.
Won't launch. Just lost a dollar. 10/10

I love this game. This game really described sometimes how I feel, I have been battling depression for 3 years and I still have it ,but I am winning. I take medication and goto a therapist. Sometimes my horrors have been real, but I got through it and I don't care about the horrors anymore. I would like to thank whoever made this, my mum for supporting me, my dog for company and myself for getting over everything.
