Okay I am just going to say I wasn't expecting to be crying in this (I have never cried in a game nor movie before, beside that Futurama episode with the dog, ♥♥♥♥ that episode). I know it is a Telltale Games Series but in the one game that I didn't expect to cry in I cried so hard that I had express my sadness to my friend... After that I realised I made once wrong choice and I ended up playing the whole game again... Only to cry again... 22 hours in 2 days...2 hours  of that was crying into a pillow... 11/10 would cry again.
I have only played this game for 30 minutes and I think I have faced the worst luck possible... I lost two crew members on my first move first game and then got killed the next turn... And the next game I lost all my crew members in three turns...10/10
Why you should buy this game:1)...2)...3)...Why you shouldn't buy this game1) Everything 2) Everything!3) MOTHER OF GOD EVERYTHING!!!
My Lord Yimotep, This game has half my hours on steam, :D
