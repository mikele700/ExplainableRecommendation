I obtained this game as part of a bundle not really giving it much thought at the time as an individual game, just another piece to add to the Steam games pile. Upon playing it however it was an interesting and thought provoking... thing. It lasted me a mere 2 hours, but I felt it was well spent. I don-'t see myself going back for a second viewing but it-'s something that I feel doesn-'t need it as it gets point right on the first. Is it worth it-'s price? I honestly can say I don-'t know. I remember someone once saying -Art can only be valued by the individual- or something along those lines. Remove the price from the question then I would say definitely pick it up play/watch/listen.
