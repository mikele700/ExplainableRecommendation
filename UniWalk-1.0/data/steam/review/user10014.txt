Blow ♥♥♥♥ up. Annihilate your fwiends c:
Probably one of the best free to play games out there, its fun, requires teamwork and has a huge amount of variety in guns and upgrades etc.The only way money helps you in this game is for skins and to unlock things a tad faster.Overall its a great game
Kinda steep learning curve, but as soon as you grasp the basics you will lose yourself in this game, it has so many things going for it, from the nice clean layout to the different victories, Civilisation V will keep you interested for a long, long time. You also learn heaps of interesting facts about History, which is always good
