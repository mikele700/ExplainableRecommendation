Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is another installment in the game's series and is quite an amazing game. Really, I only got to get this game through steam sales and the normal price tag of the game will explain the seemingly unreasonable prices for good weapon skins on steam market.Anyway about this counterstrike game, it is a great FPS for a comparably cheaper price than other well-known ones and provides a good player base for people from Australia to play (I am only mentioning Aust. but its a wide spread game) and playing with friends is actually fun. The ranking system I guess is adequate but sometimes a little off-the-mark. Sometimes the system pairs you up with really high ranked people leaving you behind in the scoreboard. I understand that when moving up from Silver to Nova makes u verse Novas but sometimes its a little unfair.All in all, CS:GO is a great game not just to play by yourself; get your friends on this :D . It's an amazing game by Valve.
