Hawken is a great free multiplayer fps. I thought all the controls were well thought out but Saying that, I have only had experience with the keybord controls but the game has support for controller as well. As for the game, there are plenty of servers and there has never been a moment that I could not find a server when I wanted it. The game does a good job of teaching you how to control your mech and you can always go to control settings to remind yourself of what to do or to re-purpose keys. the game also recommends servers for you based on your pilot level, mech level and your gear. all mechs have an ability, items, a primary weapon and a secondary weapon. your primary and secondary weapons have unlimited ammo but will require cooldown time(3s)after overheating(some abilites can instantly cooldown your mech). I found the xp and hc(hawken credits) generously given and progressed to a new level almost every round. This game is probably the best free game on the market and i would keenly recomend it.
