Its good for buidling houses, since i was a contenstant off hopuse rules, i like this becasue i can build houses. Its a shame i didnt win house rules, but fair enough, at least im the king of rust and they call me rusty russell.
Very fun and moddable game, i couldn't tell you what the objective of the game is or how to finish any missions, but it probably involves getting bogged and using your winch alot.
Very fun, good fun once modded and as a stock game. Highly recommend to pick it up during the sales!!!!
Bloody awesome game, gotat be real commited though takes a lot of time to do stuff. But if your up to it, then buy it. Also the modding is easy too.
Great racing game! Very fun especially the driting competitions, but it get's a bit repetivtive after 3-4 races.
