Game Is Fun But Every Other ♥♥♥♥ Will ♥♥♥♥ing Raid You Every TimeBut All In All Is A Good Game
Decent zombie game although linear graphics is still got enough content to keep me playing it for a few days and I would recommend playing with a friend because by yourself can get boring pretty fast the amount hackers is reasonable only got hit by one once and it was annoying but he got banned pretty fast which i like to see.
Game is very nice and story is good altough I wish it was longer cause I really liked the game it was very fun to play and go through and uncover the hidden things that not even your character knew.
Probably one of my favourite games in this kind of genre great story and very nice graphics for it's time this game is a great game if you just want to go through the story and it can be harder if you want to die alot.
