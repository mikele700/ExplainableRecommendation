Sloppy game mechanics and frequent crashes during gameplay, particularly during the tutorial campaign, let this title down when compared to Medieval 2 and Rome 1. The look and feel of the original tabletop like battles has been nerfed, random unit entry and objectives give battles the feel of a street brawl with unit tactics being downplayed in favour of spectacle for spectacle's sake.
