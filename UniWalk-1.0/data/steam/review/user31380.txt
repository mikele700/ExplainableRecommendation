Planetside 2 is one of the worst games i have ever played it is buggy and laggy if you wish to talk whilst playing this game you can't because of the sound the sound cannot be muted turned down or altered. I would not reccomend this game to any gamers out there it takes forever to download and then when it has downloaded you have to install on a completely different browser do not get it will be a waste of your precious time.
