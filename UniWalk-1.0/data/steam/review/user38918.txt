Best COD made period. Sledgehammer games has done it, redefined the COD franchise. on par with the greatness of COD 2 and World at War.Definitely recommend this to people who are thinking whether this COD is worth it or not. I can tell you this, it's 100 times better than ghosts. Apart from Riley.... coz he's the best but yeah... =D great COD game out this year, you will not be disappointed.9.5/10
Such realism, feels like im driving inside the car itself. Great physics and great simulator, unfortunately i dont have enough space to put my wheel anywhere so i only use a controller. But this is the best driving experience i've had. feels so empowering to drive in the LaFerrari or the P1, even just sitting in a alfa romeo it is thrilling. Must have for driving enthusiasts or even just looking for a good driving game. 10/10cannot wait for more cars coming in future updates.
