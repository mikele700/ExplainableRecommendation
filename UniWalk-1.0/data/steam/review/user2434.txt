FTL: Faster Than Light starts with nothing, no sound, no video, just a loading screen.When you load the menu, there is a solitary note, singular in it's ability to convey...EmptinessBut as you play FTL, you'll find that space is not as empty as it seems.An ever-advancing Rebel fleet, rogue asteroids, and giant alien spiders are all enemies you will encounter when playing FTL, yet you are not completely helpless against these foes.Armed with the information crucial to turning the tide of the Rebel Fleet-Federation War, you have many weapons at your disposal, such as missiles, teleporting bombs, lasers and even your own crew!But take care, as your enemies also have access to these weapons, and will stop at nothing to stop you in their quests for dominance, scrap, or pure glory.At the start of your quest, you are tasked with the delivery of highly-sensitive and crucial information regarding the one weakness of the Rebel Fleet:  It's strongest ship, the Flagship .Through 8 different sectors, home to many different species of aliens, each with their own unique abilities (faster system repair, higher melee damage) you must manage your crew (which can consist of any 8 aliens, though diversity is recommended) and their specialties in 6 skills (Piloting, Weapons, Shields, Engines, Crew Damage, Repair Speed), system power, scrap (currency) and hull health (depletion of which will end the game).FTL is difficult, really difficult, there is no save+load feature, meaning that any actions taken are permanent, and can have dire consequences (giant alien spiders notwithstanding), yet this difficulty is what makes FTL such a refreshing game. Due to the randomly-generated nature of everything, no two playthroughs are the same, meaning you will never get bored with this game, just extremely frustrated at times (pesky missiles).Yet, this is still one of my favourite games even 2 years after launch, the soundtrack is amazing, the gameplay is outstanding, and the thoughtfulness and visual design is out-of-this-world! (space pun).TL;DR, FTL is definitely worth it's price, and with the addition of Advanced Edition (free DLC that adds many new features) will keep you entertained for hours.I hereby dedicate this review to Trevor, and her +7% to Engines.
Pretty good
