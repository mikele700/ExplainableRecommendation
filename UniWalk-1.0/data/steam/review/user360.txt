 great gunplay, nice alternatives, good stealth play, amazing graphics, cool characters, great voice acting10/10 in my booksoh and SPACE NINJAS
it is a fun game but when you get full ghillie suit,canteen,alice pack,cornfield(infinite food pretty much) the game just sinks, it becomes boring and stupid, Then multiplayer you die loose all your stuff and well, have fun starting over, The developer could have put more thought into the graphics as well. All and all i dont recomend it, it get boring and very repeditive.~thomas the dank engine
