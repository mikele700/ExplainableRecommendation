Black Mesa is a great game, I played through the mod many times and I bought this version mainly for the multiplayer, which did not disappoint.The multiplayer currently only has the deathmatch and team deathmatch gamemodes, but they're both a lot of fun. Deathmatch is just chaotic killing and I'm sure team deathmatch is a lot better with friends than it is on your own. The maps are full of detail, being big enough to survive and find a weapon, but not too big that you're isolated from the action. It's a shame there are only two gamemodes, but I feel the quality and quantity of the maps make up for that, and I'm looking forward to when they do add different gamemodes in the future.The singleplayer is better than it was in the mod, there are several significant changes; the new sounds and models are great, the general look is better with various subtle changes, and some major ones too. Even though the game is unfinished, it still has a lot of replay value to it. I've played the mod excessively, yet I'm sure I'll play this newer version many times until the game is completed. So far, there haven't been any game-breaking bugs, the game crashed several times when I first started and there have been a few dodgy textures floating around but they are not frequent enough to be annoying.Overall, I would recommend this game. It is reasonably priced by today's standards, and there is a lot to do in both the single and the multiplayer, even being unfinished.
A great game to play, it has an amazing soundtrack and a decent story to it. The puzzles are mostly easy but change regularly and keep you thinking. Deffinitely reccomend this to all.
Quite a fun game to play. However I found that it got a little hard, difficult and repetitive to play after a while but it is early access currently so I'm sure things will change. I would recommend this as a fun and different game to play.
