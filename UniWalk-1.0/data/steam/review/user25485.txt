As far as DLCs go with what they offer, say a new gun for 5 dollars or a skin for 10... to get street art pieces which you find in the game for no -internal game gain-, knowing that you are mainly donating the money to aid people in war torn areas, makes me want to keep playing and supporting this game.Would gladly do it again. In fact, if they offer more content in future, but ask for a higher price so that a good porition will go to charity, as well as paying the developer-'s wages, then by all means... I will pay. I will gladly give.
I wish I could of played this... but it keeps crashing when I try to -reconnect-'.
It failed me on one of the first few missions because I wasn't pressing W fast enough... Apparently. After a brief moment of playing, I feel ill from playing it. Too much is happening in it and none of it is good.
Playing this game makes me wonder if I have Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Complex... Everything MUST work in a set way! WHY IS THERE COAL ON THE GEAR BELT? Where does the production line start? Where does it end?I look forward to what else they can add into this. Perhaps a city builder can be added as a late game thing. Who knows? All I know is that I got a factory that demands to keep growing.
A great city-building game which encourages careful planning and management as you start building up a town from scratch, literally.From gathering resources of lumber and stone, to managing the food and tool production, Banished is a game which rewards the tactical mind and punishes the rushers.
