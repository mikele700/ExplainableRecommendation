Okay, I'll be blunt with you.Want some story?Want Edge of the field Graphics?How about some fantastic AI?Don't get this gameDo you want almost endless progression with hundreds of pieces of gear each for all 4 classes?Do you want great variety between each playstyle?Perhaps the massive number of mission and insane enemy variety?Actually, how about this- Do you want to have fun?Thats it, That is the single greatest feat this game has- its absolutely terrificly fun, it harkons to the error when a game cared for nothing but making sure you left with a smile on your face and a longing to try it again.While i'll mention the fact that this game is best played co-op (With up to 4 players) its still a hilarity on singleplayer, Everything from voice acting that sounds so absolutely wrong- yet is so right, The game is buggy and feels like a PS2 game, But everything bad about this game makes it so much better.Just buy it, Get your mates and buy it- The gameplay draws you in, You stay for the insanity and leave in a banquet of explosions and giant mech punching your friend into a skyscraper.Go on, buy it.
Its sad because its a good game, Rather solid and quite fun.Then comes the hackers.And the dodging-entire-castle-gates-by-just-making-block-towers..Then watching your entire 3 day plus work of art get demolished by someone else because you were not logged in.Do i recommend it? Yes.Why?Because its fun, Butt-knifes.
