You HAVE to buy this game, it is beyond amazing!
For the price of $15 you can't go wrong with this!
Sick of boring old FPS (like CoD) then pick this up, I had NO idea how fun this was till I played it on pc
well it's... Oblivion!there is NO other RPG series like the elder scrolls, if you have played Morrowind then this is a better looking yet more stremlined version of that.if you haven't played it... get it!
A great RTS that users Games for Windows LIVE very well, if your looking for a new sci-fi RTS I would look into getting this
CIV V  is a great game
Day of Defeat: Source is a great FPS with a community that doesn't scream in ya ear every two secs!
