Offers nothing new to gamers, bad visuals, terrible story and boring gameplay 0/10
Very good indie title, great stealth, good game play and fun gadgets to play around with 7/10
I played 20 minutes of this, and it ended with a zombie rubber banding across the map and killing me, unoriginal game concept and the graphics arent anything special 2/10
One of the best gaming experiences ive had, and a real treat to the people that have played the previous games, without writing a massive paragraph ill just say that this game is FUN, and thats pretty much it, i dont recommend this if your a big story type but the fun game play makes up for what it lacks in any logic at all. 8/10
Fun game with alot of potential, but not worth the 30 dollars at the stage its at now, 5/10
A great community driven game, which offers unique game modes which keeps you playing for hours 10/10
