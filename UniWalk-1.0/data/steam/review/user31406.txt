This Game was absolutely awesome! I found the story line engaging and quite interesting. The art style is magnificent, and you find yourself just looking at the scenery. The tactical turn-based combat is amazing aswell, so fluid and provides an awesome challenge. this game is very well balanced in pretty much everway. If your a fan of Turn-based strategy games, this is a must play. I got a solid 9 hours out of the story, but it will vary for everyone depending on the decisions you make.9/10
