The fact that Team Fortress 2 is still going is a testament to how good it is. With its consistent updates, It-'s awesome Community and good old HATS! Team Fortress 2 gives you what most First Person Shooters can-'t give you anymore, hilarious fun without the pressure of -doing well-. Honestly if your on steam and havn-'t played Team Fortress 2 yet. What-'s wrong with you?ayy lmao guys play comp tf2 (6v6 or 9v9) it-'s actually so much better then the rest of the game.
