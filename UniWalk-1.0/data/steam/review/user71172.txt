The game is a good game. I might understand the negative reviews in some points but the game is solid and bit (over 100 levels).The only problem for the game is probably that it gets very addictive but only when you are deep into it.I personally love it and let's not forget that doesn't cost a lot!I rate it 4/5
i really didn't like it. i'm sorry. slow and boring
