a really good reboot on the zombie genre that is not so demanding on your hardware aka its laptop freindly.so far my experiance has been fast loading in to servers with next to no lagg and loving every new update that is coming and expanding on the game little by little.well worth the time picking this game up playing to chill out crafting or stress out over some intence zombie hoard moments XD
