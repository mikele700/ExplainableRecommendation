REALLY BIGSKY-REWIEW-Indie Retroooo-Old retro nes galaxy game waiting for us and this time indie devolopped it-Great explosion effects in Galaxy -Different Bosses to defeat-Great sound and music in entire stagesTry to get your best score but you need to know you can't get high score without upgrade your ship -So is it worth to buy it?Yea it's worth to buy it for indie game and retro/nes lovers
SUPER DISTRO-REWIEW-Hardest Platform Game Ever!-This game is really bad in opinion because stages are too much hard because of bad stage designes-Controls are really bad you can just press move inputs and jump fire button and it's not enough to finish stages So if there would be any double jump button or auto health regen or like that something that would be better-Hardest Platform Game in my opinion and almost impossible to finish the game it's not fun!-So is it worth to buy it? Nope Exacly Nope..
