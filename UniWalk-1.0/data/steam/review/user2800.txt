beatiful graphics and story i cried when John Cena died, but i quickly avenged him as he was my best friends, i really enjoyed the slow mo bullet time bits in the story would of had maps, but stilll better than half life 2, over all stunning graphics and story that really stoud out. i r8 this game 8/8 cuz it was gr8
Good Game get it NOW
DLC quest is worth it's price and is fun to play in a waiting room. Simple but at the same time it's confusing. It comes with two quests. i liked the second quest. It lacks action and need of skill, the game is just find the coins. OVer all it's a good game that needs some inprovements. A LIKE FROM ME!
