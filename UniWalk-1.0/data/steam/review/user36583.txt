Oh boy. This was a tough one.I love Colossal Order, and I love Cities: Skylines. I love everything they-'ve done for the community (Taking suggestions, interacting, etc.) but I really feel they dropped the ball with this DLC.The amount of content you get in this does not in any way justify the price tag. Who at CO thought eternal winters was a good idea? Why is there no seasonal cycle? Why does the heating system feel so cheap and tacked on?Not to mention there-'s a large amount of problems and bugs in the simulation that they STILL haven-'t bothered fixing. What do we get in return? More cosmetics!I feel CO has adopted a -We-'ll leave it to the modders- attitude. You guys want seasons? Oh I-'m sure a modder will do that. You guys want bug fixes? Oh I-'m sure a modder will do that. You guys want a realistic simulation? A modder will do that! (And they did - Check out Rush Hour.)I-'ve supported CO from the start but unfortunately if their DLC model continues like this I-'m boycotting further purchases.
Absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant.Exactly what you'd hope for in a City builder, this is what Simcity should of been.Cannot recommend this more.
I got this for cards, and I regret it. I feel dirty for even having it in my library.Judging by his Twitter, the developer seems 12 years old and is already off to a great start in life by outright scamming people with this -game-. The game is literally made to be unfinishable.Absolutely do NOT get this. Even for cards. The developer is a con and does NOT deserve the 10 cents you-'d give him.
Brilliant little game that satisfies the -Animal Crossing- itch a lot of players seem to have. Packed with charm and things to do, not to mention that it-'s being actively developed and has free DLC. If you-'re a fan of games like Animal Crossing, I definitely recommend this.
If you enjoy fighting games and 2D women with large -jiggly bits- beating eachother to death then this is the game for you.11/10 GOTY.
