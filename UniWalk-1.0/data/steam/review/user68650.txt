Relaxing and tranquil, are NOT the appropriate words to describe this hectic platformer filled with an oddly creative idiosyncratic art style for maximum aesthetic feels. (srs)This game has had me hooked by the first couple levels, which drastically get harder and harder..and harder.If you're looking for a trippy challenging game with an amazing soundtrack, THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU.
Great game can't wait for 2k14.
