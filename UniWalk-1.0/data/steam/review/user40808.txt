Risk of rain is a game deserves to be in your steam library.This game revolves around the items you find which can impact your overall gameplay. Would you be a ballistic man spewing rockets and mortar non-stop or would you assemble a drone army? This depends on your luck. The spawn items are random which makes the game have a high replay value. Having the right items can make you feel like a god as you see boss after boss fall before you.The music itself is very unique and fits the game very well and I commend Chris Christodoulou for giving the game so much life. The artstyle may be a turn-off for people who do not appreciate 8-bit graphics. However, it appeals to me particularly the Imp Overlord and the monster logs of each creature you can encounter in the game as such a simple art can be so unique.However this game like anything has its drawbacks. After a certain amount of time collecting the right items combination, it is more of a test of patience instead of a test of endurance. At a certain point you would feel your items and your drones are carrying you into the battle instead of you. Some may find the game a little bit brutal particularly during the boss or the late game as they spawn relentlessly but it may appeal to you as it gives you difficulty and challenge.9.99$ for this game? A steal i must say.
