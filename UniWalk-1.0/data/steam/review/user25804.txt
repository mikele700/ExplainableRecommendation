love it, its simple and at first seems like there is a jump feature i haven't discovered however it soon requires some skill to get to the exit of each level, worth $0.49
Intense cqc combat that is enjoyable with realistic 1 or 2 bullet kill. Best alpha game there is with a full out modern battle or a bot elimation or  bot control point. A few bugs but still i would recomend to anyone.Btw give me your tf2 crates plz Thanks
