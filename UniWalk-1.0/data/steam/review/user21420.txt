Ace Of Spades, yeah... This game has a mixture of minecraft and Call of duty, you can even build structures, Oh My God! This game is loads of fun and you should seriously stop reading reviews and BUY THE DAMN GAME!http://www.aceofspades.com/
Why?!.. Just Cause!..You should already have this, its got grappling hooks and a whole island to screw with..This game is 11/10..
Do you want to rush into battle with your sword with absolutely no training at all...Well, Chivalry: Medieval Warfare allows you to do exactly that.. enjoy the sounds of warcries and the clashing of swords with this ultimate experience.If you get hit in the knee with an arrow, report to bethesda... they deal with you.  Like if you got that reference.     
My play time speaks for itself..Have fun........................................................................................If you count all of these i will buy this game for you.. :)
