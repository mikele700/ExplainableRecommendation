I got onto the leaderboards by punching Nazi's, ninja girls and arcade machines. Game of the year, Witcher 3 eat your heart out.
The greatest strategy game ever made!
This game is awesome, it offers a variety of fighting styles with each character and while some are stronger then others it usually comes down to player skill. I highly reccomend this to people to like competitive fighting games or even just hack and slashes with technical play. Get the game because its so unique I can't properly describe it.
This game is incredible, I mean I hate it but it is incredible. Everything will kill you multiple times and you will get made, but just buy it.
