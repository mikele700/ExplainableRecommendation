This game is cool if you like total RNG-based grindy, oftentimes frustrating, games. Even then, it's not ready for shipping. English is pretty terrible, too much extraneous fluff, and a total disconnected feel from your decisions.2.5/10 until really fixed
I got this game 4 days ago. A day and a half of those four days was spent on this game. It's difficult to put down, and I love it so much!
Pretty awesome game. I've playing for about two weeks, and if it's distracted me from modding Skyrim, then it's definitely something great. One of the aspects I appreciate most is the foundry: the freedom to create a DnD-esque questline and, eventually, campaign of your own! Granted, the game itself is awesome and a challenge* if you do it right!In other words: 8/8 m8*note: challenge does not account for everyone, it refers to the way I play.
10/10 would buttassbutt again
CONGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
