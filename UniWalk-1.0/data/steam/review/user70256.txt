2 spooky 4 me. Only play this if you love scary games, cos this games is VERY scary.Spent the first hour of gameplay hiding in the lockers cos i was to spooked out the leave.But its still my fav horror game, and the story is pretty interesting. It also retains suspence throughout the whole game and very, very atmospheric.
