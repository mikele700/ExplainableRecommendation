I don't understand how there are negative reviews for this game. The DayZ standalone is everything the mod had and MORE! I have not experienced such a good zombie survival than this ever. This game will have you building friendships, making mortal enemies, making difficult decisions and many more, all with real people. There will be the occasional bug, but it is still in ALPHA. I'd recommend buying this now because the price is only going to go up.69/10 Would eat Humans for survival again!
