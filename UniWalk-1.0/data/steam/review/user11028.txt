It's a cute little game, I finished and collected all the data fragments of the single player campaign and bonus levels in just over an hour. Apart from the length it is a good game but some harder levels would be appreciated. I don't have a game pad play with other people so I haven't looked at the co-op side of it. P.S. What is this second story teaser for? Is it DLC, second game or later patch?
I loved this game from start to finish. I have not cried in a very long time but I got so attached to the people that I could not help myself on the last walk. Of course I recommend that you go on this adventure for yourself and find out more about the horrors, but also the little pleasures, of war.
