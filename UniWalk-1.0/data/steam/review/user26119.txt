Good game.Requires tactics and knowing the right time to do certain things. Many things come into play like recoil or accuracy when moving. Would reccomend it to anyone who wants to play a shooting game but a tad more slow-paced and more tactical. If you want just a quick game you can do a casual or deathmatch. The competitive scene for this game is great and really expresses the tactics and teamwork of this game. Without that your just a bunch of idiots with guns!10/10
