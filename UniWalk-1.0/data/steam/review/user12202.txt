Turns out there's a game breaking bug at the 2nd dungeon (Drenchfort) whereby the blue ball is missing and you can't get in. That's it, end of story. Restarting and reloading doesn't fix the issue. People have been complaining about it since FOREVER and the developers haven't even DEIGNED to respond. Don't buy this game, and if this is reflective of how the developers take responsibility for their product, then I suggest don't buy any game from this developer at all.
