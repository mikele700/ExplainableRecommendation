OMG! It has finally happened! :D A copy of cod we can all be proud to own.  Between the fluid movement and the very balanced game mechanic's, I must say this game rocks ! I'm so addicted and love it so much :)
OMG what a piece of crap !! why would you disable sli and cross fire support now i can only use fxaa !! ???
I love fez !
Im not much of a street fighter fan, but i do own both ultra and sf x tekken and I have to admit that the game mechanics are much better and movement is much smoother with the ultra update.  Not seeing much when it comes to new arena's, but the extra characters and extra arena's do make a difference.
