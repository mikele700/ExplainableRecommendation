Great game 10/10
Great game my rating 4.5 my friends 4.25 out of 5 i spent 6 hours and couldnt beat the game my Friend comes over and beats it in 4 tries :/ i think i just suck i might be JB as well
Awesome game but can't seem to configure the sound i have no sound :/ help
Awesome Game just needs more productive things such as fishing etc need to add planes and boats that are workeable and this will make the game better add dedicated servers and so far 8/10 beacause of some glitches and when u try to join a server it says timeout that is annoying anyways good game still needs improvement
