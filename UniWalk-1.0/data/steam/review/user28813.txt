This game is really well made. The campaign is really awesome with an easy to follow story line. The mulltiplayer is very fun and exciting except for the usual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ online, its brilliant!! Definitely worth it :) 9/10
Call of Duty Advanced Warfare...what can I say? It's better and more colourful than ghosts means that I'll give the game a 6/10 Why? Because I get the feeling this game is optimized for consoles rather than PC. The campaign is way too jerky and there is ALOT of frame stuttering, I own a GTX 760ti and should be able to run this game at medium settings at 1080p 60fps. On the other hand, the multiplayer is very fun IF the connection is good, why the hell are there no dedicated servers for the PC??? Which brings me to the same point, THIS GAME IS OPTIMIZED FOR CONSOLES. Would recommend this game if you are not a serious gamer and wouldn't mind the lag this game brings. The game is still very fun though, you just need to control your anger.
This was my face when starting the game :DThis was my face at the end of the game :(Why? BECAUSE I PAID $22 DOLLARS FOR 2 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY WTFFFFFTTG could have at least made a the first episode longerI still love the game though...
Really like the easter egg. If you notice the manager of the lemonade stand is a man named Cabe Johnson which is a reference to Cave Johnson from portal where his company does scientific research and makes lemonade drinks
