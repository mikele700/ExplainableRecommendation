Great game to play, when it actually works.If you don't like having to f**k around, trying to fix simple errors (that shouldn't happen to begin with) for hours on end, with absolutely ZERO help from ANYONE that actually knows something in online forums in order to play a game you payed good money for, I would recommend waiting until the creators get their s**t together and the game comes out properly.GG
