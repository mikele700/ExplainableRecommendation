Passed Whiskey.Then I began playing Fistful of Frags.
Really good game. I suggest getting both this and the episodes. Really deep and engaging story. #StillWaiting4Episode3
Italian Spiderman Approves!
Fun, open world zombie survival game. Good multiplayer. Interesting Mechanics.
Used to be a good game. Now it runs like ♥♥♥♥ and has a bunch of -content- (i use that word Loosely). I would not recommend buying this until they optimize the ♥♥♥♥ out of this.Pros:- Creative sandbox with space- Functional physicsCons:- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ excuse of a survival mode- Remove the Dogs, they-'re a lame excuse for AI and are annoying rather than a challenge- Runs like ♥♥♥♥Summary: Used to be Good, Dev-'s got lazy, poorly optimized - Don-'t buy yet.
I believe this game has some great potential and is generally going in the right direction. I will be interested in the way they will implement the 'Thirst' system as currently water is pretty hard to find. I think one of the biggest problems with this game is hackers and 'Naked' hunters. But this can be solved by good administration and some fair rules. Personally speaking, i would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good, realistic survival game with great multiplayer and interesting features.
