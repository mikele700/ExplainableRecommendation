Don't care what everyone says, this is my favorite third person shooter, they need a second one!
Awesome so far, has a lot of potential, there is sooo much they could add but so far it plays well. Its a simple smooth hack and slash. and I beleive it's just gonna get better and better!
so far I love it
Brilliant RPG, if a little tedious, still i have spent days on it and didnt really get bored, quite good if you ask me
