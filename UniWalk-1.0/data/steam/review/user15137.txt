Mcloving this game, just recently took over a castle and then got it taken away from me and lost all my companions. Now I'm going to come back with a vengence and slaughter them all! There will be no mercy!!
Hey, I just recently got this game (I have played all the other total war games and loved them) and this one is by far the best! I know this had a bad launch. But it's so much better now!! Been playing Rome campaign for a while now and there has been so many challenges just on normal! And trust me, playing every battle with no atuoresolves is heaps of fun!
