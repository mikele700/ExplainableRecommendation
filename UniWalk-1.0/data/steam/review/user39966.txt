Amazing game! Dont even question it just buy this straight away! Everything about this game is just excelent, the artwork is flawless, the music is awesome, game play and controls superb. Everytime i die i just want to start again just to see what will happen the next play through. A great game to just pick up and play, but something you can really try and focus on too. I cant express enough how much i actually enjoy this game.Only problem i found was i struggled to want to buy the goth chick a ticket to the concert...10/10 seriously
