A great spin on a new genre, clickers. The added dimension creates a feeling of usefullness when clicking compared to other clicker games. The progression does eventually slow down a lot as the progression end game is comprised of resetting to gain timecubes, which can feel repetitive at times. The connectivity in the game allows you to connect to a live leaderboard, aswell as the ability to continue your game on your mobile phone and cloud saving. These features are implented exetremely well, and create the most interconnnected game I have ever played, and sets a precedent for not only this genre, but all games.
