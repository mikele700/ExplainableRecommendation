Brawlhalla is a reskinned SSB for computers. There are  3 different control schemes, and I prefer to my mouse to attack. The controls flow well however, we should be able to map buttons instead of following a control scheme. It is very easy to learn, but I struggle to win an online fight. I understand that the game is only in beta, but I do believe that there should be more servers *cough cough* Australia *cough cough*.Overall, Brawlhalla is a fun, intuitive game that I can see myself buying. I am a big fan of the SSB series, and to see another brawler on PC and Mac is nice, I'm sick of Smash Flash. 8.5/10. Love it, but it leaves room for improvement.
