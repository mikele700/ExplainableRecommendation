Played for 13 hours building the strongest empire I possibly could just for France to effortlessly punch my ♥♥♥♥ in like the tide washing over an intricate sandcastle. 10/10

10/10 would pick up ♥♥♥♥♥ again
This game is balls out badassget on it
Fantastic game, if you can get 4 players the harder maps can be a challenge to maze and require a lot of crowd control skill from the player weapons. Choose your tower upgrades wisely!
If you're from New Zealand and you don't play this game there's something wrong with you
