Quite the game to relax into. It's a very calmish game with a mix of minecraft but more battling and more logic towards the game. Trove could've been better though a suggestion. Make switching to a differnt character not feesable. But it still]is quite the game to kind of relax into it's not fast paced. All in all Quite a good game.
Bad Rat's is a good mind game a Great game if you're up for a challenge mentally. You have to think you're way throughout the levels. It is a psychological game and is very fun and funny! Recommend worth the dollar if your mentally minded.
It is a good game to realise economy and to -adventure money- But it is addictive and very fun once you get those Quadrabillions xD but yeah addictive and very fun and free! So yeah very good game dosen-'t really take much thought processing.
