It is an emotionally grabbing game, at least for me as a programmer. It is amazing. And very sad. I only got to level 2 first try, but it was still amazing. Definately worth buying.
Amazing game. Followed its development from when the public demo was released around a year and a half ago. Even better than I expected. GET IT NAO
