The most immersive game experience I've had since Sakura SpiritBut in all seriousness, you can get lost in this game pretty easily, as long as you can endure the shoddy voice acting. Personally, I see little opportunity for replayability, but one playthrough alone is easily worth its price.One minor issue is optimisation, it runs very strangely with certain combinations of settings switched on. Also, it will slow the speed of the game if it cannot reach the desired frame rate, so keep it reasonableThis is not the kind of game you can play for 30 mins, stop, and come back later. You have to set aside a few hours to really get in the zone, totally worth it though.8.77/10 - Crimson Heads will ruin your life
