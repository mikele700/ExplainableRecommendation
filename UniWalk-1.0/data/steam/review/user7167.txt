Great atmosphere, punishing gameplay, good times all around. There's a special feeling of doom when you open a door and your injured hacker gets splattered by a rehacked turret, and you realise that now the rest of your team can't get back to the escape hatch. I'd have preferred a longer, more drawn out game though, 4 missions in a campaign can be done within 2 hours at the most, unless you end up getting your party killed halfway through a lot like me. Party relationships seem to minimally effect the game, and the party banter ends up getting recycled an awful lot. I like the random generation of enemies and scenarios, and it can range anywhere from relatively easy to kill melee ghosts, or genetically-modified aliens with blast weapons.All-in-all, it's worth the under $10 price tag if you can roll with getting killed a lot.
Really fun, tactical shooter where you coordinate with your team to win.
Great, gory fun for everyone mature enough to see it!
