Well balanced, challenging, addicting. Encourages teamwork but often on Australian servers, there's anything but.
Endless replayability, with original concepts. Decent story if you thoroughly think it through and an excellent soundtrack to go with it. Hard for beginners but it's more addictive than doing a line of cocaine. Not that I would know. Would really recommend buying this game. It's perfect, considering this is an indie game, so it's really well made. Buy it whenever it gos on sale, but if you really want it, 6 dollars is still a steal. It's a great game for people with enough time for this game, but not enough for hardcore games like Dota. You can easily waste an hour on this game.The controls are great for anybody with mechanical keyboards, but rubber domes might be harder because you need to bottom out a key for it to register, taking more time/energy. Still easy to control though, just recommended to use a mechanical keyboard if you play many other games/ type a lot, as well. Play it with the music at its max, you will never regret it.The DLC is actually well developed and introduces lots of changes, making existing bosses and enemies harder. I would recommend at least reaching Mom thrice  before buying Wrath of the Lamb, as you get the vanilla, original hardcore experience before moving onto harder stuff. Overall, this game is great, one of the best indie games I've had the pleasure of playing. This is great as sadly, most of the time, I just go back to playing dota. Binding of Isaac is one of the few games I have in my library that I visit quite regularly. Buy this game if you have more self control than I do and don't have problems with other games.If you still aren't convinced, think of it this way: you get to shoot sp00ky monsters with your own tears. While naked. And you take pills that don't run your life. If you hate flies, this is the game for you. Also, it's sp000py.
