How the hell they persuade NS and Majesty bikes to come onboard with this? It's by far the most broken game I have ever made
Shot a guy, his body flew about 20 metres into the air, still managed to live 11/10
Incredible game11/10
Quite possibly the best game that I have ever played, 100% finished with only having to use a video tutorial once. 10/10 should recommend :D
