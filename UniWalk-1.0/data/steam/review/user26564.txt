 The Game This game WAS a fun and well balanced alternative to Supreme Commander, and I might recommend it to anyone looking for something like SC2... It-'s just... Not dynamic enough, I-'ve found myself winning galaxy after galaxy... And that gets kinda old after a little while... I bought this game back in the days when it was expensive (Alpha), and they gave us a pair of crappy commanders that are buyables, they weren-'t even novelty. They really don-'t care or listen to their fans, so they released -Titans- even when we told them it would be better off a DLC or something. My Message To UberStep up and take responsibility, your fans aren-'t here to wipe your asses with dollar bills. Instead Of This Piece Of Expensive Poop, Go Buy These Games On another note, I-'d highly recommend Supreme Commander 1 & 2, Executive Assault and Earth 2160 instead of this thing, they-'re cheaper and better made. You-'ll see where the idea for this game came from. Maybe even Space Engineers if you just want planets! Peace Out Bruh 
Doesn't boot... All of my other games boot, so I can only assume it is a problem with the game...Until fixed, I cannot play this game, I would love to though, what the f*** valve and Bohemia, what the f***
Brilliant game, great time waster for all of you StarDrive fans... A great addition to the Sci-Fi x4 Strategy games!
