My favourite game in my inventory, granted it was much better when I played it in 2012 on my older accout but I still find the atmosphere and games just as fun.
One of the best free to play games I have played in a very long time. Can't wait to see more, very addicting and a great team and individual game
Such a fun game. So many different things to do and fun to have with friends!
