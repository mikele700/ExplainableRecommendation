Orcs Must Die 2 is a great deffence game. I realy just ove that you have to build traps and troops t protect the rifts from the orcs. I much prefere Orcs Must Die 2 over the first one becuse i like how there is now multiplayer. If you have other friends with the game you can try to beat their high scores. But the only bad thing is that it is one of thoes games you might play once or twice then never play it again. I dont play it us much anny more but it is a good game to buy for the price even though it gets boring after a while.
