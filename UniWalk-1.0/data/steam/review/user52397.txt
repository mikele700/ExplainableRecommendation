I love it!The Elder Scrolls saga hasn't failed meAND IT NEVER WILL.Keep 'em coming Bethesda.
It's fun... I'll give you thatBut to me there's just something missingThe game seems incomplete IMO.But all-in-all really, REALLY, cool and fun game.Worth buying, and while your at it buy the first game.
May not be much but it is REALLY FUN!
