Everything in this game comes together really well. If you need another couch party game then I can't recommend this enough.
Controls can be a bit finicky sometimes but it's still highly enjoyable. Just note that although it's able to be played solo, I don't recommend because it is quite difficult and nowhere near as fun.
I never thought my childhood would come back in HD.
This game is one of those few rare gems that does everything it wants to perfectly. Fantastic story with deep and interesting characters, fun combat that is super responsive and never gets boring, loads of upgrades for various attributes of your character and amazing graphical detail all wrapped up in a great PC port that fully utilizes keyboard and mouse controls. The fact that this was created by a single person really makes this a must have.
