Ate a chocolate bar, leg was fixed..... BEST GAME EVA
fun and addicting game but classes need to be nerfed so Ara isn't a god
Not like Left 4 Dead where you can just run & gun No More Room in Hell has 2 modes Survival and Campaign Ammo is very precious and the type of weapon you mostly use could be a melee. Teamwork is needed to survive and NEVER GO ALONE or your possibly f*cked. Barricade to keep the safe zones protected no more just shooting zombies in the gut or d*ck and it'll die. This is a great Zombies Sim.
