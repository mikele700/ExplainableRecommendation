This game is a great game.... Let me rephrase that. This game WAS a great game, wonder why, i-'ll tell you why.First off, being honest, i used to absoluteley love playing this game even before it was on steam, the matches were fun, balanced, friendly and all out great, even though the -'robot-' building was a bit tough, I liked it, as it gave me challenge to buid something cool but allow me to learn from what works and what doesn-'t, but then, it was introduced to steam.First up, what i though when i saw it first arrive on steam i was like -Oh, awesome it-'s on steam now, now i can play with my friends..- It was good for quite a while, but then they started updating alot more, at first it was pretty good with the addition of armoured blocks and electroplates amongst other things, but, then the later updates happened, they are what annoyed me.From what i saw with those later updates were, new blocks and some new game mechanics and matchmaking, some were alright but others were absoluteley horrible ideas to even get to the development without asking the community what they wanted, as if it-'s FreeJam-'s way of saying -We don-'t give a damn about what the community wants added, we just want more money- And this kind of behavior really annoyed me, as for one thing they changed, they removed the armoured blocks, for what, ♥♥♥♥ing colours that you need premium for more than 4 types, or was it the fact they wanted to attempt to -'balance-' the entire battle challenge of the game. They also removed the pilot seat, like, that-'s what defined the shape of your robot and how you designed it, as they likely would-'ve though it being to easy to be killed, they removed it.Not only did they add new mechanics that heavily unbalanced the battles by having a 10sec no-hit repair time delay that allows anyone to fully repair their bot if they stay untouched for 10 seconds, but they changed the entire -'Tech-Tree-' so many ♥♥♥♥ing times, it can-'t even be called a tech tree anymore it-'s more of a damn -'Tech-Spiral-' now while it used to be you had to earn points to select what you wanted to unlock instead of leveling up to get each item consecutively like they-'ve done now, and the fact that they-'ve set it with each conescutive item tier, the price is drastically increased, so most people will get premium to spend real money for ir, I understand that, they need money to keep it being developed but honestly +500% in-game credit price increase for one tier higher in which, most people can-'t be bothered mustering enough in-game credits to buy alot of those as that-'s what most people do.Worst part is, with the addition of the -'Robot Factory-' which is just a market where people can sell people thier robots so new players that get what they want will just purchase a high tier bot and use that, which makes the game-'s already unbalanced rank matching, even worse.To end this review rant, if i made a review of this game before it was on steam and i would say that you should get and you should play it but i-'m not, instead i-'m saying that you should not play it if you are unable to spend real money for this game as it basically a money making machine for the company. And here-'s a message for the Devs and FreeJam, chnage what you have done to this game, listen to the community, don-'t just look at a few people saying that they don-'t like something or they would rather something, listen to the people that actually care, that actually want this game to be fun and something that they can play and actually enjoy playing it,instead of being annoyed by the tryhards with bought robots.
First of to say, this game is incredible, it-'s like one of those games where at first glance at the graphics you think is absolutely terrible but i am here to tell you otherwise.This game is the opposite of terrible, it-'s an absolutely amazing game, why it is, is because everything but the graphics is awesome the graphics themselves aren-'t too bad though considering the age of this game, but the gameplay is really good, the story is great, the audio pretty good and some of the sounds are funny and strange, there is a large range of enemies, animation is really well done and not to mention the camera settings as there is three one of them (which most players would like) is a eyes camera, where you are actually seeing through the eyes of the dragon which is awesomeSome would debate me and say -pssh there graphics are terrible and so what if there is an eyes camera it-'s still bad- but they are wrong, if you actually give the game a chance, I promise you, you will like it.So to finish of this review basically play this game it is amazingly good for it-'s time of creation and cheap for it-'s quality unlike other games where you do one thing throughout the whole game and just because it-'s graphics are really High Quality the game has to be $40. So I really recommend this game to all but especially to people that love dragons.
This is a good game, and here's why.First off, this game is not just a game with a few levels it has many and with the involvment of the community the amount of levels is almost limitless so you have many levels to challenge yourslef with and you can make your own levels, so others may challenge themselves on your levels.Next, is the fact that it uses music to create amazing game immersion, with the levels being created so well that they are in time with the song used for that level, so if you create your own level, make it to a song so it fits perfectly.Not too much to say about this game as it has such a small amout of amazing features, but there is the fact that there are enough challenging acievements to keep you playing it for weeks on end, unless you don't even care about achievements, the levels should keep you going anyway.There is one thing that i would like to ask of the developers, can you please add more sources for songs so people can use songs that can't be on NewGrounds, so that way people aren't limited by the NewGrounds audio pages.
