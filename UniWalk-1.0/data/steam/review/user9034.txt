I love this game. Most people are used to FPS, not TPS, so they don't like it. It's a great game when you get down to it. Simple, but not too simple. It's perfect for a casual play.
Good only if you're playing with friends through Discord or Skype. Alone is suicide.
Great game, but be cautious, pretty much all weapons are 1 shots
Great game but if you want everything, it's gonna cost ya.
