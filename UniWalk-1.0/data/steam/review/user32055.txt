IT NEVER REMEMBERS MY SAVES.♥♥♥♥ you trapped dead, and your ♥♥♥♥ ass memory. Ps the fact that you have to pass level 3 just to play mulitplayer is also complete bs.
7/10Positives would be basically you're in a ♥♥♥♥ing space ship! First of all. Secondly great array of blocks, alien creatures (friendly or foe), great mystery when exploring civilisations and of course love the fact that you can choose to eliminate or friend civilsations and trade etc with them / steal all their ♥♥♥♥. Although an early release game is going to have its flaws as Starbound is only in Alpha, major improvements are required. Such as a better variety and significantly increased civilisations that you stubble upon on planets. The game is based on exploration and I find that after a while it becomes boringly repeatitve, especially when you keep finding the same or similar civilisations on differing planets. I'd also suggest more underground finds, or possibly even hidden underground civilisations, just something to encourage players to explore underground more, instead of just venturing down for ores. Definitately needs to have more craftable 'bricks' to build with. At the moment its only possible to craft 'Cobblestone' or 'Steel' (Beta stage) bricks, especially due to the small ship space players are supplied with, it makes building a base on the 'Home Planet' inevitable. Of course this problem is solved by some awesome ship mods, but in game I think they're should be an option to inprove and expand your ship as you advance in Starbound.
