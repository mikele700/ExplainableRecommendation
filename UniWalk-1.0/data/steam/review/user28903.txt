(spoilers)That feel when Telltale makes you decide which brother you want to leave behind. I quit my game and was like nope I ♥♥♥♥ing can't do it, then went back an hour later and balled my eyes out like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ as I choose roderick to stay behind. ♥♥♥♥ing cheers telltale for making me actually cry over a video game 11/10 would cry again
Very Promising game lots of fun with mates. Had a ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun blowing up other ships together worth the start up fee!10/10 would awkwardly fly again
This game was ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.
