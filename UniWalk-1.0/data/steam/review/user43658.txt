DayZ improves upon the elements displayed in the ArmA 2 mod. It had become significantly more advanced in regards to not only the items and locations in the game but has also indured quite an extensive overhaul. The framerate is easily 100% smoother than in the mod and also seems to have been optimized better than ArmA 2. Even with the almost endless amount of content the game is still in Alpha. This means two things. First, new features are constantly being added which results in common updates. Secondly, it is broken. Now it's nowhere near as broken as some people are making it out to be and by no means is it a cash in. However there are several elements that are buggy and/or broken but that does not, at least in my case deter me from the game.If you're willing to help test the game and don't mind having to restart whenever you're killed it's definitely worth the price tag.
