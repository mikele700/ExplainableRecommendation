You can disguise as a melon in prop hunt 1000/10
You get to throw poop on peoples houses in a minigame 10/10. I would highly reccommend this game to anyone because of its gameplay and stroyline. The story missions between the Ronin, Brotherhood and the Sons of Samedi are so diverse and gripping that you feel for the characters and want to reach into your screen and kill some of the gang leaders and you feel that after taking over stillwater that you have actually acomplished something. The humour in this game is defintely also a strong point with it not being over the top in most areas but still being able to be laughed at. The gameplay is also surprisingly good for a port and minigames like fight club, crowd control and septic avenger making this game a classic. I would highley reccommend this to any fans of GTA or Open world sandbox games. Overall this game would be a 9/10 in my books and I have not finished the game on PC yet but I finished it on PS3 a few years ago I believe you can easily get 30-40 hours out of this with the missions and minigames and even more time just causing chaos in stillwater with homies.
Played for around 30 minutes and loved every second of it. I would definitely recommend it.
