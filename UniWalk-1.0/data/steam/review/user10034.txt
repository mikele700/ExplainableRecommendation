This game is amazing.Early access might turn you off but there are weekly updates for new content and regular bug fixes, although, when you first load up you're not gonna know what to do, i recommend VideoSage and LastStandGamers in order for you to find out what you're doing and learn how to make cool stuff :)
I met the neighbours, they killed me and took me to a cave 10/10
This is honestly the best game i've ever played, it's every game you can want with physics and ragdolls and an extensive workshop with virtually infinite things to choose from 10/10 would play.
As i look up to the sky, i saw something, it was a double crate drop-I need it- i said to myself so i make my way there. i see a naked, i had heard stories of nakeds with hidden guns who kill people, so i look to him and said,-see this-*Points to crate -I need it.-i shot him in the face and walked away with my metal fragments and explosives10/10 would play again
It's like gang beasts but not fun
Like dark souls if you are bad at dark souls and like devolver digital.
