ive always been a skeptic of f2p games but this one is actually alright.
Got to admit 11/10 the atmosphere was really spooky but some of the jumpscares were just badly placed.
People seem to think this is a finished product and give it a bad review. Honestly did you see the early access box?
I want to die
11/10 gonna jump off a bridge after team switch
11/10 would urinate on a cop again
dont read the reviews just buy it and cry
this game is great has a long engaging story but if only those stupid online fixer contracts wouldnt interrupt it. very fun the gameplay is a bit of a mix between assasins creed and gta.
Honestly way better than most mmorpgs in my opinion
