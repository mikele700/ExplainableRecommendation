The best point and click adventure game there is. The best part is when you have to point and click on a bomb to make it stop beeping.
What do I say about a game based on being a bad ♥♥♥ pilot who can defy physics by firing while spinning in mid air and crashing into boats to kill them? Oh I know! This game is a worthwhile purchase! Got it for 2 dollars during the Summer Sale and I'd say the 2 dollars is worth it, not sure about full price, but I think the game is worth the purchase!
This game, right here, is one of my favourite games of all time. This game is so good at getting you psyched to play the next level because of the satisfaction of beating a stage. The game really brings out the 80s feeling and the ultraviolence into one magnificent package. Buy it now if you want to experience an adrenaline rush.
My, my, Skullgirls. I've had this game on my wishlist for a long time, only deciding to purchase this when it went on sale for $2.99. My god, I have missed out. This game is such a satisfying fighter, you feel so good after landing a 15+ hit combo and utterly destroying a team. The character designs and animations are gorgeous, they all look and feel different (unless we're talking about Filia and Fukua). Congratulations Skullgirls, you have a place in my favourite games of all time list.
This game is so badass that if it were a person, it'd have muscles on its muscles and eat bolts for breakfast with a side of motor oil.
It's a really fun game just massacring hordes of freakbags. *cough* HUNTING SHOTGUN *cough*
Who says educational games can't be fun?
