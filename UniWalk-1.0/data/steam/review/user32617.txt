Are you a hard-core strategist? Then THIS is the game for you!This is a game where you control entire civilizations, and your actions determine their uprising or downfall!Has an immersive experience, aswell an EXTREMLY in depth strategy.The replayablity is endless, no match is ever the same, with completly randomized worlds, to historically accurate maps, you can play over and over.Plus all the civilizations you can play as is amazing. With DLC, it's 3x as more!Only downside is it's steep learning curve at the start, but once you get past that, prepare for global domination, and crushing your foes.
As you can see from my hours, I have played a decent amount of time.It's an amazing Game.Great to play with your friends and community. Lot's of good game modes to keep your occupied for hours.It's way more fun to play if you have friends that play it too, so either get your mates to play it, or join and play regularly aswell as chat often and let the friendships start.Everyone says its dead. The only thing dead about it is the updates, there is still 100's and 100's of players online all the time. So pitch in and play!
