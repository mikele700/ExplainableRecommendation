It's at least my favourite game on PC. The amazing graphics, bright lighting and intense colours really make this game look unique. One of my favorite aspects is the amazing combat. Disarming a SWAT officer and shooting the others with the same gun made me feel like a bad ♥♥♥! I'm still obsessed with it after a year of bying it. Ever since I jumped of a building and on to another I wanted more!And for the people who can't wait for the second (me included): Mirror's Edge 2 will be coming out as a prequel in 2016 or 2015, at the earliest. Faith is apparentley in ger late teens and it looks like it might have alot of stuff to do with her mother and family.
This review is going to be short just like the fun in this game. It's about 2 hours of messing around for no reason until you realise that $10 would have bought you a Fallout game that can generate hundreds of hours of entertainment. Just watch youtubers play the game and save your self some money and space.
