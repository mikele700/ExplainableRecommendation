OK. So let me explain. Borderlands 2 has you searching for a vault that is holding wealth, but some crazy guy called Handsome Jack tries to blow you up, and you are helped by a robot called CL4P-TP (claptrap). Then you get a gun... and then 87 bazzilion follow. A unique and beautiful artstyle, a action packed, deep story line, characters that will make you smile and growl. Not to mention, this game is all about loot. There are a shipload of guns that you can use, some with elemental effects: corrosive, fire, explosive, slag and electric.. There are also 4 characters you can play as. Salvador the gunzerker who can dual weild any two weapons and shoot the shizzooly out of enemies. Maya the siren who can phase lock her opponents so that they are easy to shoot. Axton the commando who can send out a sabre turret which can support you as you fight through hoardes of enemies. And Zero the assassin who can create a decoy of himself and then takeout his enemies from behind. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!
good
