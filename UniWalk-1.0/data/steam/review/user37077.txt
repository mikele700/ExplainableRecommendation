Great fun to play with randoms or mates, doesn't get old
Killing zombies with mates... What's not to love about that? Still a great game even with the sequal.
Still an swesome FPS, that requires more skill than -COD-. If you can find a decent server that the same people keep coming back to it can also be a heap of fun.
