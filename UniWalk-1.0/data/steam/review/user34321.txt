This game gives user an achievement when they enter the game menu, which means buy this game is some sort of achieving? Also, people in game never took a dump, while I'm feeling a little bit constipation for a while, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.I've done another run, everyone is starving to death while at the same time I have 100+ vegi and 80+ meat in stock, FYI there are 3 canteens for around 80 survivors, I think those resource is quite enough to use for a long while if AI is not at dumb as this.
Not a bad game.
Go playing this game if you don't know how to waste your time. PS If you love STR games.
