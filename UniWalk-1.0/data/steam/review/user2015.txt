As far as HD remakes go this is a little lacking, no expansion content make it a bit of a let down.I would reccommend teh GoG version over this one unfortunately.The new textures are nice though.
Pretty cool game, doesn't afraid.
This HD remake, unlike HoMM3, has everything you could want. Coupled with it own expansion it is truely one for the fans and new players alike.Would recommend
