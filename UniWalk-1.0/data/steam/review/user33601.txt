This game is extremely entertaining, literally hundreds and hundreds of hours without getting bored. Has a slight learning curve but is extremely easy to get the basics of. Incredibly fun with friends  as well. Been addicted for ages to this game. Finished a nation playthrough? Go for many of the hundreds of achievements that are actually achievements, play as any of the hundreds of nations there are, go for achievements or world conquest. PS: Watch out for Baguette and Kebab though :)Seriously though this game is insane, I also recommend getting the soundtracks as they are pretty awesome as well!
