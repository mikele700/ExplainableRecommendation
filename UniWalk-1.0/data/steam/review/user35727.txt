I have only played a total of approximately 15 mins, and I am amazed. FNAF 2 is much better than the original in terms of horror and gameplay but playing the old one occasionally is still fun too. I love this game already, 10/10! Good Job Scott!
This game is my number one favourite game, nothing can beat it. Love the story!! So emotional
Fantastic Game. Atmosphere is amazing. The listening mechanic is a real game changer. I personally love the game and believe it truly IS the best one out of them all. 10/10
Extreme. Too Good. Must Get. TAME ALL THEM DODOS
