-Do you feel like a hero yet-. That is the question you ask yourself even after the game is finished.This game tells an adult story that I have wanted for a while now, where it is not afraid of the media with some of its moments. I want more stories like this, that make you feel like an idiot for making the wrong choice.My score is 9.5/10
