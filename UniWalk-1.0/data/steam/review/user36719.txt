Great game, has some subtle P2W elements but all-in-all you can do just fine without paying a cent. Gaijin is one of the best devs I-'ve seen, they provide great content and listen to their fanbase. Just beware of Nazi apologists and people who scream -RUSSIAN BIAS!!- to cover their poor performance in-game.
FREEEEEDDOOOOOM
Playing this game is like taking high-grade hallucinogens. 11/10
