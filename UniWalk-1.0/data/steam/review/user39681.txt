Brilliant Game! A well established and addictive story line combined with excellent graphics and an unparalleled and unique AI system. The world and environmental elements in the game are very pleasing to the eye and make a long travel in your vehicle fun and stunning simultaneously.The IDTech 5 engine incorporated into this game is very well established and is a promising  new engine that i believe will set a new benchmark for future titles like Doom 4 and beyond. This game is an excellent mix of FPS and RPG and is a must for either genre fan out there.
