Really enjoying this title, as a late adopter to CS:GO I'm enjoying every moment, its fast paced and rewarding, my only hang up is the hackers. even in comp mode you will find them, sucessfully aced a team 2 times in 3 rounds - 2 players on enemy team decide to toggle on in a competitive match turning the score card on its head and taking the game.  apart from that top shelf stuff.
