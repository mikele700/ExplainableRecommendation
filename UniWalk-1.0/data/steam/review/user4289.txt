Cavern Kings is the most addictive game I've played all year!It is an amazing fast-paced rogue-like esque game with elements inspired by games such as Risk of Rain and Super Crate Box. Now is a great time to pick it up (23/12/14 at time of review) as its 10% of until early Jan, online multiplayer is on its way! Grab it early and get a few practice games to be sure you're ahead of the curve! Missed the sale? No matter, at $10 this game is a steal with endless hours of randomly generated fun and frequent updates from its extremely active and social developer.
