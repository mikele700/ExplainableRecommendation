Old,but free. Good for early players to trade before moving to csgo
Gonna try it out. Gonna try it out.
Great,but expensive if you want to have skins. The economy is now only focusing on skins , and not gameplay.I`d give this game a go,for players who dont invest too much time into trading.
I want a refund for the game but i cant get one
