After 500+ hours of this game (not all on steam... shhhhhhhhh), I am still finding things that I have never found before. I have probably hit that new game button nearly 10 times now and invested an unhealthy amount of hours into playing them, and I am only now getting into the modding community. I have to say that it is probably my favourite game of all time (and also my most played.) Bethesda have made something here that will go down in history. 10/10
