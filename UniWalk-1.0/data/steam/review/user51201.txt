It is an unfinished game! By all means it's nowhere close to done. But it's a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun. Locomotion is a blast, if not the most intuitive, and though the weapons are very basic, and the maps are clearly placeholders (I hope,) a game like this has a boat-load of potential for future updates, and I plan to come back to it for every one of them.
