Great co-op features, extensive gameplay that is definitley worth the wait. Here's the problem though: DLC costing waaaaaaay to much. One single character costs $14.99!! Christ! Other than that, well thought character roles and incredible voice acting for all 4 (6 if dlc is included) characters put this game on my top 5. Rating? A solid 9/10
