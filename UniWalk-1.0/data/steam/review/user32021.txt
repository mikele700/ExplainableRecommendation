I wanted to like this game soo much, I have easily exceeded 500 hours on borderlands 2 but this uh it's just not as good.Honestly I have tried to find good things to say about it in order to recommend it to friends but I just can't, the storyline is okay, not as good as borderlands 2 but it has a few funny lines and is still better than your average fps, the visuals while being essentially the same as the 2cnd just fail to capture any real variety -essentially the same area recycled over and over and over again.The characters are more inline with borderlands 1 and the trees go back to being a slight dps increase rather than a playstyle definer. But playstyle is the true casualty here. The combat from the 2cnd game heck even the first has been taken out, stripped for parts, ♥♥♥♥♥ with a hammer than lazily slopped back in -easily the worst of the franchise their is no variation u have to go in guns blazing full board with no other option. enemy ai will not allow for control or long range options they will charge your position or grenade spam and their is nothing u can do about it -cover is worthless this time round and any slam or grenade hits will send you flying due to gravity.Gravity is the absolute worst mechanic ever introduced into a fps, it ruins everything it touches in this game, the lack of atmosphere makes exploration painful and not worth the effort, the use of said atmo in combat and the forced nature of its use is just extra frustration, the jump mechanics to get it to work can be fiddly and again frustrating with fire being able to knock u out or lock u into a low burn so very easily. the slightest hit with a nade or slam will throw u from cover and often off of cliffs or walls -into hazards etc with nothing u can do about it. lunatics this games versions of psycos especially can just be a pain to deal with as they rush ur position and spam ground slams.Vehicles, this game introduces 2 new ones and they are shocker -absolutely terrible, the game throws ALOT of vehicle jumps at u especially early on but the first car can barely make any of them and will often just zoom straight off into the beyond -the game gives u the 2cnd vehicle early and while it can make the jumps its this lame as slow wanna be bike or speeder thing -just soo much fail.Finally the laser weapons -my god f the damn laser weapons -in a players hands they are terrible ammo horing weapons dealing little damage per ammo but in the enemy hands they will rend your sheilds and health faster than a rocket round, the ai is extremelly acurate as they are in all borderlands and these enemies can fly and manipulate the gravity it's just frustration to deal with them with all the other factors in play.
This game could have been great, but unfortunately the pay to win/compete factor rears it's ugly head -the game looks and controls fantastic unfortunately ships cost over 7k in game currency, crew cost over 7k in game currency -average currency gain for a win is 30-50 and thats not even going anywhere what shells cost and that they are one shot uses per buy.The number of ships and crew is disappointing, exceedingly low for a game of this type and with the ships most are not even buyable until you have reached a certain lv or gained an acheivment.The game is severely lacking in an offline capactiy, even online there should still be a decent ai option and tho it's there it's very barebones with dumb ai and little reward for spendign the time on. no campaign to speak of, the game starts out looking liek it will have a decent story and mission mechanic but you get to the league unlock it and the games like there you go now give us money.
This is just a real gem, the graphics are very pretty for something under 200mb, the story is fantastic, the gameplay is fantastic and it's flippin free.seriously why are you still reading this, download this game!
The gross out humor, political wit and just about every form of negative sterotyping is in full south park swing so if you don't like south park avoid this game, if you do despite a relatively short exp you will be replaying this game for days finding all the referances and nods to the show.As an rpg it stands up very well, playing very similiar to paper mario with a mature twist to the attack styles, visualy it looks like it was cut dierectly from the tv show which is actually pretty impressive and the story is fantastic even if some of the scenes go a bit too far but hey thats south park :3.There is a anti-censer patch in the forums and if you have no friends in america that can buy then gift it to you I would strongly recommend downloading and installing it.  The glitches that plagued launch are near enough all gone now and I've only encountered 1 during my time playing anyway.once again if you love south park this game is a must have, if you can't sit through a episode then give this a skip as the southpark style is in full swing throughout.
