great shooter
Really Good for a Free game. i love it!
This game is amazing. i had sooooooooooooo much fun playing it. I love the gun textues and the biomes are amazing. i would recomend this game to all gamers
Great face changer! cant wait to show my friends!
One of the best first person shooters i have ever played!
i Saw the Games Ad and Thought, -Looks Great, Plus i am Bored, Lets Give it a try- Once a Downloadad the Game, i was lagging, the loading screen took WAY To long, the Animations were ♥♥♥♥, the Player Models were Plain. Its just a bad remake of Counter-Strike. i Dont think i want to play it anymore. i mean, they hardly even worked on the gun models for this game. But, The fact you can ride in cars and take hostages as sheilds is pretty cool, other then that the game is just like a better version of COD.
I love this game soooooooo much.with all its gamemodes and addons garrysmod Will NEVER get boring!
