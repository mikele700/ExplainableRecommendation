Do  not buy this game. i have had it since beta and they still haven solved almost any problems relating to it. chrashes on startup, chrashes on game start, incredibly unoptimised, cannot run it in windowed, laggy response from units, and for some reason it slows my computer to a halt after every time i play it.
Absolutely and utterly terrible game. when you and a million people cannot even get to the main menu, you know the game is done pretty damn badly. guess bohemian are still playing with barbies and havent decided to acctually get a real job and create a properly functioning videogame.
