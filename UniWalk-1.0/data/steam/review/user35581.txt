Absolutely wonderful
I played GTA2, GTA3, and now this. A real classic, with much improvements. When it's time to get your anger our, this is the perfect place. Saving money now for GTA5
My kid has been playing this in single-player mode, he seems to have a lot of fun with it. A real canvas for creative people.
Very well made. I play using Logitech Momo steering wheel. This steering wheel never performs better before. Really love this simulator, it chills me down.
The first 1 hour play is a complete stunner. I almost got a heart attack. Awesome built.
