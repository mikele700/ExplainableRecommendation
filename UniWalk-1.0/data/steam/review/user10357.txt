Amazing game. Plays just like the original, only way better. Similar enough to beat Mom on the first run with 11 achieves, but new enough to get curious about all the new items and enemies :3
Amazing game! Goats!!! Wouldn't mind a touch more sheep, but then there's GOATS!Might not be the best for a completionist as some of the stuff is quite difficult to do, but this game is still amazing no matter what!
