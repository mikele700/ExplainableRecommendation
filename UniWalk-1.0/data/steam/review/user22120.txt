This game is a mmorpg and does seem like a clone of other popular mmorpg's such as World of Warcraft but as you will see it is much more. However with a price tag of $0 a month it is a must have! The whole concept of Rifts and alternant dimensions makes it feel not just like a clone! Rift is a fun and well structured game with a friendly user base and supportive staff that really try and make your gaming experience as smooth as possible.
