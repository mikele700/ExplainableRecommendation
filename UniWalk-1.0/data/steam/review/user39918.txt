This game is quite fun. It's a 2D Top-Down Space Shooter set in the upper atmosphere; as such, you need to deal with manuverability via thrusters, but aerodynamics are still a factor. The game itself is enjoyable, but the real fun comes into the ship building aspect; there are many different ship types, weapons, gear, software and armour to choose from. Want rotating turrets? You can have that. Want to attach yourself to enemy ships so that you can destroy them close up? It's possible.The only real downside is the leveling system; it takes a while to level up (which is the only way to get new parts.) There is also a budget system, which limits how much you can put on it (ship space can also be an issue.)) You increase your budget by killing people in explosive fashion.They could fix this in my opinion by making it easier to level up or simply removing the leveling system and retaining only the budget system, but that's just me.Overall, the game is very much worth more than the asking price. Try it out!
The multiplayer doesn't work (since there are no players whatsoever) and this game hasn't been developed on since last year.This game is dead and will never be complete. Do not buy this.
This game is absolutley amazing, even from my 33 minutes of playing.Music and visual style are superb. Multiple paths allows for lots of choice and eventual replayability. Lots of opportunity to cut down time in levels. A story that isn't shoehorned in, collectibles and songs to boot!For $9.99, this is well worth the price, whether you are a hardcore speedrunner or a casual puzzle platformer fan!
