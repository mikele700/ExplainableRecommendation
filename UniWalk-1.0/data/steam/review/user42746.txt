10/10 -It-'s okay- - IGN
Knights of Pen. And Paper! I tried to be witty there.Now, I'm not one to do really large reviews, but I can tell you this: Buy this game.A ton of people will go on and on about how it sucks, how it's stupid, but it's a really fun RPG game for those that are into the genre. And a lot of people have gone on to say that it's just a time waster, but no, it's more than that. Like an RPG game, it'll take you into the story the best it can. It's up to you, if you let it do it's job or not.And as such, this took me to believe that not many people gave it that starting chance. The chance to change their lives forever.Now, you might be thinking I'm biased, and yeah, I am. I never got the chance to grow up with great games that were released on older gen consoles. Like the NES, the SNES, and even the Sega Mega Drive. I got to miss the truly astonishing ups and lows of gaming history. All because I'm a kid. So, when a game like this comes along, a game that does so well at giving the player a feel of the old world, I take it like it's a van full of candy.But, TL;DR: Buy this game if you're into the genre, you won't regret it.
This game, I loved it ever since I strived to get ArmA II and play it. It was emersive, beautiful. Yet, had it's downside. It doesn't limit you to be one or two things, it lets you be whatever you want. Want to travel with friends and help others? Everyone will be grateful and love you. Want to travel alone and kill everyone you meet? Then you better be skillful, as your head will have a pretty bounty. The good die quick, and the bad live forever. It's a game that makes you put yourself into the game, makes you pour your heart out into one thing. Only to show you, that games too, can be the real world.9/10, Beautiful and envoking.
