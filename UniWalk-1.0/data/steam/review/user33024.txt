Got it today and played around 6 hours of it. One of the most engaging and awesome looking games ever. Well worth the $10. What makes this game one of the best games is the scenery; destroyed buildings, blown-up cars and other people. The story is very engaging and the loading times are super quick. Im also running this on a crappy little tablet with graphics on high and I still have around 100fps. If you havent already got Half Life 2 get it! Also dont worry if you havent played Half Life (Number 1) because I have not and I understand the  majority of the story.EDIT: Just finished it and it is easily the best game I have ever played. The story is the best and so engaging that I just want to live in City 17 regardless of it's owners. I would like to personally thank Valve for making such a great game and all the voice actors. Thanks so much for a game that I will remember forever.2nd EDIT: Playing through a second time and finishing off some acheivements and trying for 100%. One problem though, is it me or is the hidden acheivement not the one where you through the can at the cop??? I've tried everything and i cant get it. 10 ² /10 ²
Sadly I would recommend this game, if it weren't for the old and current price. I was stupidly persuaded into getting it and regretted it. The Escapists is fun but is really repetitive and there is no real sense of achievement. The workshop intergration and the map creator is fun but it is also really hard and there is no templates you can use. Overall-Do not recommend game unless it is on sale or gets a good update in the future
Really hard and really addictive. Its like the new flappy bird. Wolfenstein 3D is fun and sets forth many hard challenges and mazes. Plus you get to kill Hitler.8/10
