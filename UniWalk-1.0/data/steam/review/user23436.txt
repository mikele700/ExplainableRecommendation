Good game, came before LoL and the rest, so its the original mechanics ect. Wonderful heroes (no microtransactions for heroes, just in game items) Love it, everyone should play it!
SO this game is alright. Exept for the fact its a glitchy buggy pile of ♥♥♥♥. Now dont get me wrong, this game is very polished and looks amazing, exept the controls are quite a mess, Q,E, W,A,S,D and the right mouse button all control the camera. Not to mention the combat has a nice combat triangle with smalls good against large and large good against other large, not good against small ect. But every once in a while the game randomly chrashes and not to mention on the SECOND mission i lose 100% of the time, not because of how i play,but because after I destroy cargo ships that i need to stop from reaching a warp gate, which your sopposed to, to retrieve T-Cells, after i kill them I get a message saying I let the cargo ship through?!  This happens even after 4 restarts. At this moment i would not recommend this game unless the devs patch this quickly.
Wonderful game, better than Civ 4 in all ways, great mechanics although you need to buy Gold(Deluxe eddition) for Gods and Kings (the expansion pack) other wise the game is a little buggy and bad, any way great game all round!
