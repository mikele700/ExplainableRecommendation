cured me of my autism 10/10
hhmm oh a new bioshock game eh? well time to put the boring and cut and paste first person shooters away now and play a well overdue game of the genre deserves. well i'll put this out of the way now, USE A GAMEPAD! that is all. the controls are really crap and should not be burdened with at all. but that is all i have with the game. its story telling is amazing even rivaling Half life(*gasp* really?!) the gunplay is fairly interesting with upgrades like in Systemshock 2(only a whole lot more Forgiving...)by all means play it...its really good
its pretty good
