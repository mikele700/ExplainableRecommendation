10/10 would throw into the chalice again
This game is good, if you are. It is all but nessesary (at least if you want to make a difference) to have a large group of other players whom you can work together with and cooperate. It is entirely possible to play this game on your own too, but I just think you don't get the full effect.
Got hax, rekt scrubz, became a pirate. 10/10.
