Undertale is a game I have never played in a loooooong time. As an RPG game lover, I love the elements implemented into it with a mixture of Pokemon (more like the sense of Pokemon). Its soundtrack is great, its story is expandable to three different endings, and it will fill you DETERMINATION.
Portal 2 is a challenging, yet comical and adventurous. I reccomend this game for gamers the love challenges and also have an amazing sense of humor. This is the most-liked gamed on Steam, and if dare try to find a bad review, you should go home and rethink your life. P.S. - You will find a -ball of iron and a vegetable.-
L4D2 is a great game if you love zombie killing with friends! it's also challenging and lots of fun! GET IT NOW! I RECCOMMEND IT!!
This game is like a miltary simulation, it's amazingly fun and very complex. You have to plan out a stratagy in order to a great chance of winning! I highly recommend this game for experienced players with stratgeic skills.
It's a game where you work with others players to do certain jobs, and it is a open-world (more like space). It is like FTL, but  with a 3-D view and less people playing it.
Click, Produce, ???, Profit - 10/9
Very fun and stragetic, it has cosmetics and some weird physics. You should really get this game, anyways it's free!
Equivalent to other FPS games, this will be worth your while. As they are different gamemodes, it is not that hard to understand with many maps too. Trust me, play with friends while on CS:GO, it will be fun and exciting!
This is an amazing game, it does have it's flaws.. But, if you have a creative and active imagination, start playing this game!
