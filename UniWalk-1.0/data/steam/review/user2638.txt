Finished game in 20min all picsonly 3 soundtracks and one of them is on the video on steam (above ^)completed with pants still on it was that fast.good pics, high quality. 7/10 i miss hunnipop alreadySakura series will learn allot from that game, thus making more better because they already have the good quality.
I rushed this game in 3 hours, but that was without looking at the well played areas and having fun at laughing at -cake is a lie-, ect.but i did play it again, to admire the way they have designed it and made great use of common sense and problem solving methods to strain your mind if you had not done much problem solving games, i would recomend this game for the enjoyment, old cake is a lie jokes and it-'s a good retro play if you consider this game retro now.
This may be a bit late, but i thought it would be wise to share my thoughts on this game, as far as Strategy games go, this is one of the largest scaled ones i've seen, giving massive battlefields, high-tech units and destructive power to everything, unleashing my inner desire to kill everything in a large area, while having a big play area to have so much fun with! Up to 8 player maps, maxed out games can end in 15min or up to 2hours long, giving a wide variety of ways to build your forces and face your enemy head on in this large-scaled-high-tech-land/air and navel weaponary pure destructive fun, this would have to be hands down one of the best i've played, even after the game has been out for so long, people are playing it everywhere today. So as far as you should play it or not? i think yes, yes you should play this game.
