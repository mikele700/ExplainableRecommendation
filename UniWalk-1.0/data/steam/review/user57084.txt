I really like this game, It has alot of things to do and create and id recommend you go play ;D
Great game, love the graphics :D
Fun little game to play, love blowing up the opponent!
Fun to play for hours as it's very addicting to play the different game modes and arena's. Levelling up and getting all the garage parts is also a different aspect of the game to enjoy. Love the new hoops mode!
