im joking its a interesting and fun game porr clem tryin to get her parents back and man it sucks because it is very very sad that duck and kaja are dead i mean she didnt have to kill herself but i understand she was so upset and depressed
I Recommend DayZ cause of the open world zombie simulation type game i love the mechanic and the way you shoot its a real good vibe and its kinda like real life in shelfs are normal junk and helmets and all that and really rare guns like an m4 under a military bed that seems realistic but i would think theyd be in a gun rack and it is also good because i played nether and when you die your stuff drops but in dayz the loot stays on body (unless they log) and i just feel like its a real good game Hope alot of people buy this and hope to see you online (if you dont kill me).
its a great game if u have the right one that u have u have l4d2 and l4d come together and 2 new maps there good but not bad u can play online with other people meet other zombie lovers and kill zombies with and add them as friends i mean u have the survivor Rochelle,Coach,Ellis,Nck they are l4d2 these are l4d Francis,Bill,Zoey and louis the infect for both are Smoker,Hunter,Spitter,Boomer girl and boy cant choose Tank and Jockey so id recommend buying this new version of the game
