The game play is simple yet effective even to the highest standards. You will enjoy basically open world with missions and simulations that will never cease to amaze you if you find the right game mode. If you look at the graphics you have detailed gun’s, detailed worlds and uniforms however the game play is far from perfect, this is due to the weirdness physics engine and how it reacts to you and other players but this game has been nothing but pleasure for me and with these DLC’s you simply couldn’t have non-stop fun with ARMA III!
Where do i start?? Well this game presents many Positive points but little Negatives. The positive points in this game are the ease of building in your garage, Ease of use of Weponary and how easy it is to kill people without Armour. The Negatives are the Teir displacement's you can have a Teir 8 in a Teir 5 Battle! That is way too over powered. All in all this game is 100% worth Downloading and trying, for being a free game it is worth getting Premium to make it easier to get RP and Tech points.When you first start the game things start off easy as you gain RP (Robo Point's) and Tech point's to progress up the Teirs but as you progress you have to build more and more functionable Build's too better your opponent in Armour and Weaponary.
best game i have played
