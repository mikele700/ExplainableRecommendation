I touched my self to this
Good Game
Terraria has a great crafting mechanic and neat 16-bit style graphic. Seasonal update brings various nifty items you can build/equip/craft. Best when played with friends.
Cool Zombie, Free roam, sandbox, MMO.
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is one of the best games I have ever played. Skyrim is a snowy and unforgiving place that has been struck by war. The Imperials and the Stormcloaks fight for the land and the freedom of Skyrim. Then there is You; A Prisoner (Like in all of the Elder Scrolls games) Captured by the Imperials and sentenced to death, and out of all of a sudden a dragon appears and attacks the local town you are in. The rest of the game is all up to you and your decisions.
Starbound so far is a good game. Just imagine Terraria and Mass effect had a baby. Keep in mind what ever bugs you may encounter in the game will hopefully be patched soon and God help us if chucklefish deletes everyones worlds and characters again!
Source is better
