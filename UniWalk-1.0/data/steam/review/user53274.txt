Haven't played since release. Was a good concept then, heavy on a basic laptop, and likely better now.
Abandoned by the Devs: DO NOT PLAY!
Backed it and love it. The devs are great and have crafted a beautiful game. Sucks to be you guys who didn't get the KS swag
Old fashioned farming game; love it
I don't know if it is my fault or what; but even with my laptop that meets the minimum requirements the game crashes when i try to enter a match. There needs to be a good amount of optimization done for the wider spectrum of hardware used
Love it
It's a fun game, but still unbalanced and NOT a full release
Pretty dec game; pretty dec indeed.
