GIven the game has been dropped by the devs, its still going strong!Fan patches fix the bugs, still heaps of servers to play on and the community is really nice.Game looks pretty nice and the fighting is pretty fun. the system can take a bit to get used to but once you've got it, you'll be thinking up all these combos and ways to utilise your moves in the best way.Having been with the game since its first closed beta, i can definitely say it has come a long way!
A fun game where you dominate hundreds of enemies while completing certain goals.only thing bad about this game is that it-'s a -complete- edition with $200 worth of dlc!?!
Great GameAverage Port

When you can actually get onto the game it is rather fun.
