it is a very fun game 95% of the time until you get a game crash but that can be fixed by using mods which work with other or don't fill up the world with space planes and rockets, i had a bad review just before ksp is still one of my favorite games. ksp is just fun to just mess around in for those people who bought the game just to mess around and have fun with but for those people who want to use this game for serious purposes well be my quest but don't mod the game too much or the crashie crashie starts to happen well in my case so i suggest you get this NOW or you will be sorry
it is full of aimbots only play this game at your own risk if you want to rip all your hair out
best multiplayer mod EVER!!!!!!!!
