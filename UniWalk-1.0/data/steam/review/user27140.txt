I bought this Collection a long time ago before the though of refunds even be a thing,this trilogy is a compilation from the worst EWJ ports for PC.The first 2 games are butchered and lack the most basic levels that appear on every single version on the consols (including some of them that are on the pics show case leading to false advertisement) and uses an -outdated- DOSBOX emulation to play   .And the third game is just the cherry on the bitter cake since it universally sucked on both platforms that released.If you want a modern port to EWJ look for EWJ HD on 360 or PS3 or just look for that Special Edition  released on Windows 95/Sega CD that is better than this -thing-,
Gone home is a drama storytelling walking simulator game.Most of these types of games are usually a hit or miss,for me this one was a miss.The plot usually leads you with much expectation ,giving the good soundtrack and the design of the enviroments,but ends with a -meh- kind of situation.Giving that,the side stories end being more interesting than the main story itself,if you explore a lot.Sadly after its over,there is nothing more to look for.These kind of walking simulators games (with rare exceptions) are made more to be appreciated than be played.
Wolfenstein 3D is one of the trinity of games from id software, that make FPS on what it is known todayA classic like Super Mario Bros.,but its gameplay,like the former,is very dated.The game has 6 chapters with 10  stages each,full of secret passages to discover and nazis to shoot.Stuff like repetitive enviroments, lack of variety on weapons and stiffy controls may turn you away.But if you just want a kick-♥♥♥ shooter from the early 90's where you kill the fuhrer,no questions asked,this is the way to go.
Swords and Soldiers is a simple point and click lane based strategy game.While there is no micromanagement on multiple resources and buildings,there is the strategy of time and space on deployment of units and powers that can change the tides of a battle.There is 3 playable factions with one campaign each,the 3 campaigns feel like extensive training sections to each faction with some twists thrown on the middle,story wise there is some jokes here and there but nothing complex,it is somehow entertaining with its light humor.Each faction has its  mini tech tree and focus on a different  playstyle: the Vikings focus more on resistance and strentgh of units,the Aztecs focus more on devastating powers and the Chinese on counter attack units.The multiplayer online,while a wasteland,you can wait the game search for an oponent,while enjoying the single player content.Some battles can end on a overwhelming defeat if the player doesn't have quick  thinking,making online matches sometimes not enjoyable.There is also 3  challenges that you unlock throughout the campaigns that can hook the player while he tries to improve his personal score,don't bother with the online rankings though,they are  completely broken. Overall a good looking and challenging indie game.Its DLC contain an extra campaign that,while use the core faction as the vikings,it is very varied putting the player on different situations while controlling units/powers from the other 2 factions,the DLC also contains a harder version from the boulder challenge,I recommend the DLC too.
Different from the main game the Last Stand DLC is a different creature.It provides a wave like game mode -a la- Killing Floor with only the 6 humans classes from the Allies faction playable,and they are completely revamped changing the starting loadout.The DLC is a lot more polished than the main game (the characters even have running animations this time) but also empty servers everywhere.The agility and size from many of the enemies can lead to quick deaths with the wrong upgrades making it very punishing.But you can also spam Flamethrowers and recruit your own little dino/shocking goat to help your progress.While I recommend the DLC,giving the -almost nobody playing- status,buy at your own risk,try sparing a few bucks when go on sale.
Dino D-Day is a comical multiplayer class based shooter that basically put dinossaurs on a Day of Defeat scenario.This game already got into a phoenix-like status in activity,since the frequency of the free weekends/sales right when the servers starts to get empty.The game contains 2 playable factions with distinguished classes each own with its different playstyles ranging to first-person to third-person view:Allies(6 human classes and 1 Dino)Axis(3 human classes and 6 dinos)And also 2 boss like axis-dinossaurs exclusive to certain maps.Considering this,balance is something you can-'t expect on this game.The visuals are a little old,rages may happen between matches,but in the end with the few game modes provided it has a fun factor and an -old- with the smell of -new-.
