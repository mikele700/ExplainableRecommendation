Basically Minecraft combined with TF2.
The type of game that could make you rip you hair off with its EXTREMELY DIFFICULT levels. What could be more frustrating? Playing with your friends! Struggle your way through the levels with your friends (Up to 4 players) as all of you try to beat the levels. (Team-killing is allowed) Still a fun game to have a good laugh with your friends!
A EXTREMELY challenging game that i couldn't progress far in. However, it is still fun to play with its simple controls and catchy soundtracks!
A -sequel- to one of my favorite games on steam! It could be harder/easier than The Binding Of Isaac depending on which play style you perform better at! The Binding Of Isaac: Rebirth comes with way more items, room designs, bosses, etc. A must get for anyone who enjoyed playing The Binding Of Isaac!
A challenging, yet addictive game! IMO, the more you play The Binding Of Isaac, the better you get at it! Personally one of my favorite games on Steam!
A type of musical-game that does not require rhythm. An amazing shoot em up that plays along with any music of YOUR choice!
A game that everyone should get! Enjoy the wonderful and humorous adventure mode by yourself or with a partner, and if you are getting bored of playing the adventure mode or if there is at most 4 people who want to play together, feel free to brawl out in different minigames such as soccer, or king of the hill in a glorious 2v2! Overall a very entertaining and ever-lasting game that everyone should get! BUCKLE YOUR PANTS!
Take any MOBA, and imagine it in 2D. This is basically what awesomenauts is. It is also simpler and less fast paced compared to MOBAs like LoL and Dota 2.
A rhythm game that has a very unique style of gameplay compared to the ones I usually play!
Good game for breaking friendships! ^^
