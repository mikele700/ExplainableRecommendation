Fantastic atmosphere and thoroughly enjoyable gameplay. Despite being an FPS it maintains a level of creepiness and even panic at times, keeping faithful to the genre. Would definetly reccommend you pick this up.
I got all the achievements for this game. Super replayable, fun as hell. Pretty much anybody should play this game unless you have a short temper. Mega hype for the sequel. This game will never leave my memory as the first I 100%ed and one of the best games I've ever played. 10/10.
