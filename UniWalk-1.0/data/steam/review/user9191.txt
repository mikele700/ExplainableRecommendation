never ready 4 freddy
really fun game and challenging to play.
if we think about players from dark souls prepare to die edition then this is a improvement overall.dark souls 1 was good as in gameplay, bosses and it-'s progression, the bad thing *my opinion* was the level design was unfair and weird as hell at some points and the worst part was it-'s port, made it really bad game to have on pc. dark souls 2 fixes this bad port and the game works flawless. the controls are sadly worse as i had a perfect setup in ds1 but the way you rebind in dark souls 2 just sucks and this dubbel clicking is just god damn problematic, i cannot remember how many times i have died because the dubbel clicking made me just stand there while a enemy attacking me so i advise disable it.the story is the same, you fight through bosses, talk to npc, your the chosen 1 and going to set the final one on fire with your body and so on. the boss design have sadly gotten worse, some bosses was good and fellt powerfull while others was just lame as hell, the music was also lame as hell for those bosses.level design have been a bit imrpoved by i will never get why software love toxic so much, i usual call these places blightown from ds1 because that was just to much toxic and dark.overall the game is good and fun if you can avoid the problems and i approve for improving the port so the game is atleast playable, they learned from theyre misstake.ps: don-'t buy this verison of the game, waint until the -Remake- if you want all the dlcs togheter with improved textures.
really fun game if you watched the tv show.
if you want to animate but don't want to use those annoying and hard 3D programms? well SFM is here for the rescue as its really easy to get into it and you don't have to spend a lot of times just to learn what those buttons do, also a great way to start animating before moving on to real 3D programms.
A really funny adventure through pandora that you wont find anywere else, this is a first person shooter that have really good jokes and really funny combat, the story is pretty good even if borderlands have always been more into shooting than story telling. looting cant be more fun when you scavenge for weapons that will blow the faces from your enemies or a shield that will make you into a freaking tankthe skill rpg element is improved from the first one and is now much better than ever.sadly there is this dlc hunger this game have, i dont know why gearbox is doing this but geez, all those dlc this game have, i belive there was more than 30 dlc if you count the skin dlc that cost money but if you count out that, the game is awsomeits a most buy but get the goty version for the dlc campaigns and new vault hunters
