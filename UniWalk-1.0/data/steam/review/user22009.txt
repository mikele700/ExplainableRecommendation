Hmm MLG P2W game that obviously has tanks and a shitenugget of a US plane. 11/10 would fly to bangkok again

Game is pretty bad, on games i actually find there are tons of MLG wannabes that want to make fun of you and there is a really short character limit too and sometimes i even have to restart to find servers with people in them. Overall, i give it a 5/10
