One of the best free games out thereBattlefield + Halo + Tribes + Arma = this game
Terribly buggy, boring with constant performance issues when there shouldn't be. 16GB Ram and GTX 760, can't run at lowest settings above 40FPS
The $15 price tag is a ♥♥♥♥ing trick this game will take all of your money10/10 best game
Holy ♥♥♥♥ the beggining to this game is the most boring thing I have done voluntarily in my life
I was waiting ages for this game, and I was not dissapointed. A few things were a bit of a let down. For example, you claim to be a -vigilante- but really you are just a criminal that occasionally does something good. The hacking itself is pretty basic, but plays with some interesting ideas. You really do feel like you have power over the city and it makes the game really enjoyable. The combat system is really simple and a bit annoying, but it does what it needs to do well. The game looks ok, but I have to run it on high/medium settings, so it-'s more my fault than the game-'s. There is a LOT to do that will keep you entertained, but sometimes the side quests that pop up on the screen can get a bit annoying. The multiplayer is good but a little lacking. I would have loved to see a open world multiplayer where you can do whatever you want with your friends in this amazingly open world. Overall a really good game, one of my favourites already. I can see myself playing it for a long time. As for a rating, well maybe around an 8/10 for me. I was really looking forward to being a bringer of justice, but I was let down as it feels like another GTA with a bit of crime stopping.
