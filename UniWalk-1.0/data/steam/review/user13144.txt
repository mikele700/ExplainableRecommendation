Good fun games. Easy to learn hard to master.
This is my favourite game a LANs. Great game and it's free. Amazing
I love and hate this game the same amount. Difficult and you need alot of luck but the game is really well thought out. I have rage quit this game many times, but 2 days later I am playing it again. You can see why people who have played this game always talk about it.
A good game. Has taken its queues from the movies really well. Batman with a LOTRs skin.I loved the Nemisis mechanic as well as the Chiefs.
I really enjoyed this game. A simple run and gun style 3d shooter. Cheesey but enjoyable. Also the sound track is amazing
I really enjoy this game although at Lans there are always a few people who rage quit. Timing is very important as well as managing your stamina. A really fun game.
Different yey fun
