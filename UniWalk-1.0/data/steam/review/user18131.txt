Very unstable on a mac but when it launches its very fun i haven't played much but i already like it...
Great gam very addictive and i could play this fo hours. i lovbe the idea of geting skins instead of new guns because it makes it balence out more and forces you to practice. 9/10
Good game but can be unstable needs more items but good for alpha
AWESOME game reconmended just only if you have a little better than average PC/MAC, personally i have a nice mac and it runs this game ok. Awesome game!
REALLY REALLY boring I might get a refund!
