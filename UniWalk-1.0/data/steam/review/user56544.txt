This game is about as good as you could expect for a game that was coded in a weekend
This game is how I assume a day in North Korea goes down
-You-'re hit. You-'re bleedin-', man.- -I ain-'t got time to bleed.-
Old desktop, dry cereal from the packet, saturday morning ritual.Those are the memories that hit me straight away when I think of this game, a game I devoted years to from adolescence to pubescence. Is it good? No.Is it too far beyond good for me to find words for? Yes.I can't tell you why this game was amazing and original and something so unique it has never been replicated.The best I can do is say the experience this game provides is worth more than I can say, buy it, I want my friends to buy it, I want everyone to play what is an amazing experience and if that doesn't sway you, hell i'll gift it.
Finally, a reality where my dad doesn't walk out on me
I can-'t even be bothered highlighting the great points, yeah its a good game but its essentially a bad clone of Warhammer: Battle March. This game doesn-'t contain half of the playable races or units that Battle March did, the siege combat is actually worse than in BM and when playing as Chaos in BM you can actually destroy towns and buildings whilst battling armies in canon locations where as here you just beat the enemy army and -pillage- the town with a simple left click. The game is good but the fact that I can find better points in a game of the same universe from 8 years ago should give an indicator of its current state. Its a fun game and I enjoy the scope of the universe you play in, its also very true to the lore however, if you want to play a good Warhammer game play Battle March, if you-'re after a Total War game with Warhammer elements then, sure, pick up a copy but not for full price or maybe wait for the next 10 DLCs so you actually get a complete Warhammer game.Edit: $3 US To add blood lmao
