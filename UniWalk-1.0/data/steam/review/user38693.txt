Do not waste Your money on this game, it is not even worth one Dollar/Euro. No people, empty servers. Devs don't respond for alerts and messages from players, many bugs, and again - empty servers, no ppl. This game is dying, if not already dead.Honestly, as a player with almost 280 hrs of experience - safe Your money or spent on other, more valuable stuff.
