Finished the game for the first time ever after being too scared of it when I was younger  (headcrabs are scary ok!) . Even though the game is from 2004 it remains relevant and a great experience. Definitely give it a play if you havent already.0/10 would visit ravenholm again that place is scary as ♥♥♥♥
