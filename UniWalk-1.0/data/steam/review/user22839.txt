The new pooping simulator 2016
I really enjoy this game, fun with friends and the community is great (Most of the time). Easy to learn controls very simple.
This is a really great game but... the tutorial could be a bit more informative and ranking up is pretty slow, but playing this for a while is great and fun! When I got my new computer to play this I see that the graphics are really good. The amount of players at certain times can impact the time people can play because people can wait for 5 minutes (More or less) and be stuck at the waiting screen. There are a few bugs here and there but its not really a big deal.9.5/10
I bought this game it was good. When I just started playing skirmishes offline it was great!Even for a game that was released in 2006 it's really worth the money.
Meh, very boring....
