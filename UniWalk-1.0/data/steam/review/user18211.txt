Great game, though it was realesed a wjile back and the remake is coming out I would still recommend this to anyone mildly interested in an FPS Horror game. It is graphically refined for pc and the world and atmosphere created complements the fleshed out story. I would suggest using a gamepad as I find it easier though the button layout on pc is fine. The story is emotional and believable and the games missions are easy to understand with a few well made action set-pieces that didn't feel gimmiky. The mechanics feel up to scratch and the weapons a varied as you use different weapons for different playstyles as you are presented with them along the way. This being said the level design is small and limited in someplaces and the station seem to all b the same. There is not much else I feel needs to mentioned, I have not played the game to the end and i find increasing the difficulty make things enjoyable.8/10 (Sorry for typos)
Realy fun game but horribly short campain
