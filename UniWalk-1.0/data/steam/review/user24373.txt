Unfortunately I cannot recomend this game as I have only able to play six hours of this game before it ceased to work, which I later found was because the game engine this game was created in does not work well with any laptop computers, If you play on a laptop DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
it is a awesome free roam rpg defenitly worth the money at full price
