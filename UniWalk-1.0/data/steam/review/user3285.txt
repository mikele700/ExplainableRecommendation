My thoughts on Sunless Sea; -Sunless Sea is gud game. Much setting. Very immerse. Lots stories here. Many exploring-'Incoherant rambling aside, this is an excellant game, one of the best I-'ve played in a long while. With its interesting setting, intriguing story, fun exploration, and overall immersion; this game proves to be well worth the price of admission. So buy it. Really. Its good.
