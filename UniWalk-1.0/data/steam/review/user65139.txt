From my experiences of playing the Early Access (Alpha) verson of Darkwood is suprising really good. Yes I've copped a few, well not really jump scares but spooks as in loud sounds and hearing of things around in the woods. I'd love the smoothness of the gameplay, and the graphics for the bird eye perspective is really good. I'm digging into the storyline of the whole game so far (not gonna tell any spoilers, sorry). What they hopefully will do in the completed game of this is you could able to build your own shelters in the woods, like Minecraft. Get wood, make the walls for the house, make a chest/wardrobe, make the windows or door barriaded (sorry for the spelling), and just other things that make the game more interesting and more intense as well.Overall, I'm really enjoying the game I think it's well made and, in my opinion it's one of the best Alpha games I've played in a long time. I'll give it 10/10! Good job guys! :)
DayZ is a zombie/survival game that was first known in the ArmA2 mods. It became a very mod and alot of people enjoyed it. In this DayZ Standalone game, you-'ll encounter alot of things that made you go -WTF?- For an example when your inside a house/building, most of the time the zombies somehow go through the floors and walls of the house and inmanged to hit you and make you bleed to death. One of the other things that makes it bad, is some consumbles such as clothes (mostly) and food are floating above the ground/flooring and you can-'t pick them up. I honesty can-'t fully judge on the game that it-'s still under developing, but what I can say is it feels more realistic the way you die like hunger, thrist, bleeding to death and poisoning. When you get soaked from rain or pond, you-'ll move slower than normal, which it makes it harder to outrun the zombies. On a positive note, I-'ll definitely recommend to play/buy the game and have fun with friends and become zombie slayers!7/10
