while adding fresh ideas to the franchise it still feels much of the same, and also takes way to long to get into the game
wouldnt adivse getting get retribution instead
pretty damn good for being free, turtle rock is really showing they want to bring this game back
a unique multiplayer shooter but is held down by poor performance
A great open world fps with great story mode but poor multiplayer
an amazing game with thousands of different ways to play from sandbox to custom comuity made gamemodes
one of the best free to play games out there.
