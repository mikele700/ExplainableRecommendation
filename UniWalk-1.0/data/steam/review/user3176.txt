oooooooooooo GUNS KILLING and required skill if you want more out of this game it will last you a long Loooooong time and it is very good with co op
ive played this game many atime and the thing which i like the most about this game is that i think it captures the complete realism of how gory the middle age fights were and if u like gor BUY THIS GAME AND RIP THEM LIMB FROM LIMB literally
Ive had this game from when it started on steam (i think) and this game has gone a loooooooong way from when it started. This game right now has turned into a very fun and addictive game and I am so happy it got the front page action it desearved. Keep going devs
