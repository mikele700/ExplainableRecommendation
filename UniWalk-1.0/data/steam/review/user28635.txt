IMAGINE GARRY'S MOD RUNNING SOURCE 2 --(000____000)/
Your mission is to convert all knights into break dancers by anymeans nessary, 9/8 would breakdance again.
Not very popular for an epic Minecrafty inspired game maby have more often updates because this game seems to be in Early access for a while :/ on the good hand It is very creative for a small game and patience is the key for having a successful game for the future. Good luck
Got stalked by my friend on a bike, -ding ding-10/10/10/10 Would ride a bike again
Ok, I will give this a chance,all jokes aside this has potential, so I will keep maybe :/+The UI is lag free, and simple+The building works+there are crap physics but atleast there are some+The ragdolls and tanks look -nice- when it explodescons:-MICROTRANSACTIONS, PAY 2 WIN.-Game looks like it was made in 2003-The blood on the screen looks last gen-nock of ace of spades, Call of duty and minecraft which makes it loged in all the trash where the other voxel games are placed.-Many games can top this one off-It gets boring easy which makes you only have 17 minutes of gameplay.-feels grindy.-Early access ARGGGGGGH
No update for a while :/ Good game btw
Spent hours taking over cargoships, I realized i could copy and paste. XD
A car in the hanger drove 1000km 10/10
Heard spy say: *lets play* 20 times. 9/10 needs more voice lines.
This game was probably my first favorite game that I ever had. It was on a mac then moved on to windows but was still fun. The physics is amazing and the creativity is endless. But there is a lack of addons and content in Blockland. luckly there is return to blockland (rtb) which you can download addons from the cumminity, manage friends etc. it would be much better if they added Return To Blockland as a DLC on something along those lines. I was excited that it had finally been added to steam. I  REALLY recomend this game I give it a 9.2/10. Also one more thing, I felt abit sad that the maps where removed :( I know some of them where pretty bad but not the ones such as the Bedroom or the kitchen they where pretty good maps. I wish for them to bring the maps back, now that would give me a 10/10!EDIT: ITS BEEN a month..where are the MAPS?
