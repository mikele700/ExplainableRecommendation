as a mahjong fan was a bit skeptical about how it could be turned into a gameof any depth. However, I was pleasently surprised to find Lost Lands  a fun, nice looking take on traditional mahjong. Very nice art styles, good music and a decent story help make this game a great F2p. Microtransactions are riddled throughout, but a patient player will have no need of them and will get many monthes out of this game.
