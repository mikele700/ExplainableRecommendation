Sprayed Cheese in a british trillionaires face......... TWICE........He didn't like it...... HE LOVED IT!......10/10 Would spray cheese in a british trillionaires face again.....

I have being supporting this game since the beginning! I love the workshop because it has all these nice mods to add more content into the game! Rating 9/10
Ok ive had this game for about 2-3 years and in that time I have put some good hours into this game!This game right now is really old! Its probbile the one of the best star wars games out there.I would recommened it! Even though there is not that much to do.But back when I was playing it I loved it so fricking much!
This game could have earned more respect and gained my talent if it werent for all the having rent and paying this the only way to get stuff forever! Ingame credits is so hard to get. The playermodels suck balls, the phyics are terrible. Community dieing. Id rather go play the first counter strike game then this. Pros:Good featuresBetter then COD GhostsBetter then WarZ/Infesation Survivor StoriesNice Items in the storeFun to laugh and get competitive aboutCons:Bad Physics Terrible PlayermodelsSometimes it can be a PAY 2 WIN!Not work being put into this gamePeople that can pay dominate easy peesy
