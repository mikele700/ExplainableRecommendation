Game has it's problems. And I mean a lot of problems. Game is unstable, online is sketchy at best, the archetype system is garbage and archetype quests are insulting. This would be fine if we lived in a world pre-hearthstone BETA, as is, the whole thing is a barebones cash grab, made by a developer that is mediocre at best.
OMG so good... Holy ♥♥♥♥ its addicting
