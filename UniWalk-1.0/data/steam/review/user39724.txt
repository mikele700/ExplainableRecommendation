What is BioShock Infinite? A surreal and thought out setting in a logically processed steam punk floating utopian city 'dubbed' Columbia, revolving around a beautifully performed actress that you will fall in love with the moment you meet her who is no damsel in distress; the combat is flawless. A game of 'Infinite' appraise from critics and fans alike, this game should be at the top of EVERYONES list for 2013.
-The skill and tactical based master of all shooters-. Buy it.
Hilarious. Bizarre. Loot. Amazing.
While not the CoD Rip off most people will be looking for, the non-linear story and characters do the the show and more importantly the graphic novel justice with multiple references and characters.
Excelent Stradegy shooter with a comedic spin. Your not a steam member unless you own this game.
An abstract yet brilliant journey in a world reminiscent of the Oddworld games.
