WELCOME TO REALITY MAN!!and once you get bite, no hope bro, you. ARE. INFECTED. Sloowly so you can give your best for your mates before you becoming one of themat first we only got a BARE HANDS, so we need to find weapons quickly before the zombie comes, wether it's range or melee, so realisticteamwork absolutely NEED in this game. Go solo, and you are dead.
