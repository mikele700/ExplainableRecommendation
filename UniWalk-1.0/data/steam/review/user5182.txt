Paladins is a free to play overwatch copy i get it but it has a feel to that overwatch may never get it liek a taco with a bit of competitive,fairness and fun and i would 100% recommend this to my friends but it also has its down sides like when you accept for a game then 2 minutes later get a ban,duping and many other problems i can be bothered typing.The game is only in beta and has shown me its already going to be a high end game.
Good game but more people should play it :)
AWESOME GAME
I bought this game to play while i was 7 day ban and it speeds up time and me i love football so this game is epic
Great game )__!__!_!_!_
