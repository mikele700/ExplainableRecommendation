Lol I got Bad End twice in the intro.This game is very funny, I laughed hard while playing this.As is a cameo to the Sunrider game, it's still very fun.Next time Dev, please don't forget to add the price to it and card drop if is paid.
If you love playing XCOM enemy unknown, then get this DLC, it add new gameplay, enemys, weapon, armor, and new missions that will add tons of your hours of gameplay. you won't regret your money on this.
