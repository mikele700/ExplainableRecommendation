TF2 is an amazing fps shooter it also has tradeing and drop features. shop till your hearts content at the mann co store or simply go to the steam market.it constintly adds updates wich include new items and HATS GLORYUS HATS! wheter your a fancey foe or a plain merc the fun is up to you.
i relly like the style of the game and the roundness of the caracters, the only thing i dislike is in cp 2 were you had to dig up im still stuck on that part if anyone knows the correct keys or way i need to play it pls tell me
not much to say about this game. all i can think of is, AMERICA ♥♥♥♥ YA, COMING AGAIN TO SAVE THE MUTHA ♥♥♥♥♥ DAY YAAAAAAAAAA.
dont starve offers hours of playtime and is a great inde survival
