i really liked the look of this game i was looking forward to playing with friends but when we got in the combat was uninteresting the story didnt really pull you in i liked the graphics the art style was nice but you cant make an amazing game with just a good art style if you are thinking about buying this give divnity original sin a look first its probably more what you want
game is really fun like xcom enemy unknown but with a heap of cool improvements example stealth and using it to set up ambushes to take out large groups of units the new units are nice ranger probably the best  some performance problems and encountered one but reloading fixed it and haven't seen anything since and bug I encountered will probably be fixed when they release a patch over all great game lots of fun new features that werent in last game are good and i am enjoying playing it instead of talking to people
Amazing game nice art style warframes are unique and well done although some look really ugly gameplay is fun and fast paced but you can play slow if you want can get everything in the game with out paying real money so ignore anyone that says its pay to win also pvp isnt a reuired so other people having better gear isnt really a problem community is really nice altough i encounter alot of slackers on draco when exp farming slackers that get angry and rude when you explain that its not other peoples job to carry them yes there is a big grind but its a fun grind and if you are smart not as big of a grind as people say when i first started playing i didnt build many weapons i just unlocked as many missions as i could and by the time i actualy started building weapons i had a lot of resourcesDE some times does double resource weekends and on warframes birthday you get nice weapons some of them are good DE provides for us overall great game amazing story and lore the characters a great and the quests are getting better and better every time
