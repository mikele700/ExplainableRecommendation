Rimworld...1) My hunter got sick2) I went for...lets call him number 2. Number 2 was caring for the hunter.3) I was going to get...Number 3. To start hunting because we couldn't get food, and she didn't want to harvest crops...4) Number 3 goes on a binge eating state, at this time we have about 15 packs of food left...5) A raid happens...Number 2 has a pistol and Number 3 can't do anything at this moment because she is in a mental state. Not to mention my hunter has the charge rifle which I just use in all the raids and it 2 shot everyone... 6) I go back into another save, my hunter is still sick, I don't remeber is Number 3 got into the same mental state. I don't think she did.7) But it doesn't matter, a angry rhino comes into my piece of land and wants to kill everyone so now everyone is inside...8) Once that is over I try to get everything set up. But I can't a little after a angry Elephant comes and ruins my life...9) I make a new colony and delete this one...But tbh this game is amazing I can't believe how cool it can be, it is very realistic imo, I love the game, and how random it can be... I was playing on Cassandra Classic...
