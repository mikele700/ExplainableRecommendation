Probably one of the most fun-free-to-play games. True some items can only be obtained through paying (actual money) but you can still get sweet loot as you play the game. TF2 also has exciting seasonal events such as the Halloween events. But even during an ordinary day or month, there's a lot of different maps/servers you can join in.
