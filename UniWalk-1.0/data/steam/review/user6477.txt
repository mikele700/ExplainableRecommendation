TF2 is fun.Waiting in line for 30 minutes to play TF2 is not fun.I think you see where I-'m going with this.The matchmaking server seems to be made of liquid poop, the kind that you sit on the toilet for an eternity, praying, hoping beyond hope you can replace the fluid fast enough you won-'t be left a dried out husk on the toilet seat. That said, the 12v12 matches are a bit more fun. But not enough I-'d wanna wait 30 minutes for the matchmaking server to stop sniffing it-'s own crotch and start assigning people to actually play the game.Not to mention the fact that apparently -Casual- matchmaking in this case means -Competitive lite-, complete with penalties for quitting early.And atop all this fun stuff, the item server seems to go down every time the Game Coordinator server goes down. About every 45 minutes on average, it feels like. So even if you go on a privately run server for the -oldschool- experience (if you can find one that doesn-'t spam advertisements) you might not even have the loadouts you put together, or, god forbid, that shiny ♥♥♥ australium killstreak strange rocket powered lawnchair you love so much.Does matchmaking improve the matches themselves? Kinda, I guess.On the other hand, is it worth all the technical problems it seems to have brought? How about I extend my neck and say Nope.Valve, plz. Fix your ♥♥♥♥. I wanna play the game.
