I don't know how to explain this game. It is an amazing read and playthrough and thoroughly enjoy every moment of it. The story went through completely unexpected events and felt myself almost live the story myself. Defenatly recomend this game and hope that it becomes a series. It has some many characteristicts i almost can't put it into words. A while ago i stopped reading books in general but this visual novel has sparked my passion for reading again and i thank Michaela Laws and Seraphim Entertainment for this experience.
