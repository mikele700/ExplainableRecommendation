One of my favourite games of all time. A must buy for any rpg/fps fan.
A rhythm based rouge like dungeon crawler hybrid. With a killer soundtrack and great gameplay to boot, Crypt of the NecroDancer is one of my favourite rouge likes of all time. A must buy for anyone looking for something different, or anyone looking for a good game in general.
I've never been more anxious to hear a car in my life.
Got it for the Dwarfs!? axe in killing floor cause im too lazy to actually play the free to play game.
One of the most beautiful games i've ever played.
Great game for those people who love ripping thier hair out one by one :)
Defiance, despite its many bugs and glitches is a very fun game. I must say you need quite alot of patiance to play this, as pop in objects and enimes happen alot :l I'd give this game a solid 7.5/8 out of ten.
This is one of the most enjoyable shooters I've played in a long time.Buy it.
I suck at this game and people like reminding me.
Giving me carpal tunnel. 10/10
