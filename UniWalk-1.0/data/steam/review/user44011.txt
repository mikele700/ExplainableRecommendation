Got killed by a T-Rex within 5 minutes of playing.10/10
This game is sooo addicting and fun to play, especially online and with friends. Combined with the countless mods and custom maps in the Steam Workshop, it has infinite replay value!
Great game with awesome humor and lots of fun main missions and side missions. Spent a lot of hours levelling up each character and still play it!
