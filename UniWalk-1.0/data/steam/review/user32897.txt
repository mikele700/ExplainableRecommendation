I liked that it has a real sort of physics system and you can do and make amazing things for an early access game. i was so happy when factions were added in, made me feel safer about my ships on servers. one thing though is that planets must be added. i know it is called space engineers and is based in space but if an achievement system was made and built upon what planet you go to it would add more innovation and difficulty. Also whilst adding planets, i believe that with the amount of physics put in now, with planets you could show a scale of how much gravity is on their so players know what kind of ship to build. overall an amazing experience and I cant wait to see what the future holds for space engineers.
