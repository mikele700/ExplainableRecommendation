Great game, great ending. The gameplay itself was pretty average but what made the game great for me was the setting, the characters, the storytelling and most definitely the ending. Without the ending I would probably give it a 7.5/10 but the ending made it a 9.5/10 for me. I'd recommend it to anyone who liked the gameplay of dishonoured and the story and plot twists of movies like inception, shutter island and basically any movie that screws with your head.
Fun for about an hour for me. Exploring the map was probably the best part but the zombies are just a bit too powerful. I had a golf club and was beating up a crawler zombie but it still managed to bite me and drain my health down to about 8. Maybe I'm just a noob. Still, it was a free game so I'll give it a 6.5/10.
