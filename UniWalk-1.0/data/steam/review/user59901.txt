+Solid game, etremley in-depth action and lots of scenarios to play by your self or in a team online. +Graphics are great if you can run it well-Glitchy at times -Not easy to learn every control 
Great experience, very good for being in early access. I love the attention to detail in most of the apsects in the game, the reloading of ammunition is a nice touch and the vehicles are fun. Love the style of graphics, dont change it too much please!
Highly intense action scenes. Very interactive and one of the best games I've ever played. I highly reccomend this game to anyone that enjoys a bit of zombie killn' and a compelling story line. I'm not sure if this season will be better than the last, but I can already see some great character development in Clementine.
