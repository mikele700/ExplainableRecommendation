You wont stop. John Wayne gives 5 thumbs up. Dont mess with John Wayne. Hollos Pollos m9.
Great game cannot be compared to any other because it is very different.A day in the great world of unturned....Spawns naked lost, hungry, thirsty and coldsee a guy with a gun and you ask him for medicine, he slowly grabs it out and while he is in inventory you smash his with a rock, you steal his gun and his gear. You find other people and one shot them from a mile away. You build a base in the middle of no-where and guard it for the rest of your life.
Great game who doesn't agree. Better than its newer counter part and always will be. GREAT GAME BUY IT.
Best game EVER
