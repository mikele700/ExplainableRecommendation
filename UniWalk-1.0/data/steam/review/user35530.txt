This is such an addicting game. It's definately worth $10. The graphics are unique for pixel art. The monster log is a very cool addition, as it has detailed pixel art pictures of each monster and provideds a bit of lore. Risk of Rain has an amazing soundtrack, I'm planning on buying it soon. I rate this game 9.5/10 :3
