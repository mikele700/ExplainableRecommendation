POSITIVEIts southparkGameplayStorylineHumorGraphicsCharactersWorldNEGATIVESShortSad endingHard to understand if you haven't watched the showSome of the content is blocked in certain countries like australiaI had a really good time when this game came out I rememeber staying up tell 1-2am just to keep going had a really funny and cool storyline but it would probale be crap if you didn't understand southpark as it references the show pretty much every level/misson. overall a really cool and fun game I think it made it better because it was also delayed like 2 years.8.5/10
POSITIVEHumorStorylineCharactersGameplayWolrdGraphicsNEGATIVESWay to shortSimple plotVillain falls a bitIn octodad you are a father of 2 childern and happly married to your wife (somehow) the plot is simple and funny enough to work though it makes no sense at all but how does a octopus being a father make any sense either, I had fun with this game and do love it alot mainly because in the start the controls were all confusing but around 1 hour into the game you like mastered them but at that point theres like 30 mins left and your just sad. My favourite game because of the humor and the characters but just way to quick which made me sad.9.3/10

I have no doubt for a game which was produced and created by a single man has defnied history. This Game is seriously one of the best single player RPG's in a very long time. A game which seems extremely simple (Farm your crops) Which instead has unique and complex features to the game with a well thought and creative social and skill systems with talents at level 5 and 10 which boost that playstyle. The game is extremely sandbox as when you start it dosen't give you anything that you are FORCED to do unlike a lot of games. Stardew Valley is the best game in a long time and to believe 1 man created this master piece does make one question have far someone can go if they just keep on grinding as this game took 5 years to create!9.5/10
This is a zombies review.I will review each map separately and then review all of them as one.Kino Der Toten 7.5/10-----------------------This map is quite easy but a very classical map with one of the best training spots at the stage not a very hard map due to dog rounds and the most overpowered Wonderweapon the ThunderGun. Overall a enjoyable map which is good for new players to learn how to train and sustain points with interesting art.Five 6/10----------This map is extremely hard. Due to there only being one training spot in this map which is expensive to get to and to make it work well you need to buy 2 doors or so. The boss is also painful to deal with as he can take away your gun but if you kill it you receive a Bonfire sale. The Winter's Howl is a bad Wonderweapon which effects the map. Overall the map is good with friends due to a fun camping spot in the elevators but solo it is hard to get to high rounds due to there only being one training spot.Ascension 8/10----------------This map is pretty sick. With the first kind of new way to receive pack a punch launching the three flight pads. The map was pretty easy due to the fact that you could train anywhere pretty well and having the Thunder gun, though it had hard elements of it such as the monkeys forcing you if playing solo to only really having 2 perks or so cause they would just steal them. Overall a great map to get extremely high rounds and enjoyable with friends.Call of the dead 7/10----------------------Ok call of the dead is very different to all maps. It starts off having fog which is a pain and dealing with the boss of the map George. This fellow gets in your way and if you attack him or are attacked by him he gains enrage and runs super fast and attacks you but calm-able by taking him to the water. The Wonderweapons are great the Scavenger is a great explosive weapon but PHD is needed or becomes useless and will kill you. The VR-11 Is good to take out George but making him calm and turns a zombie into a human like a moving monkey bomb. The map is good with a decent training spot and enjoyable oh though has annoying features like George and how far jug and the power is from spawn. Overall a good map and worth playing.Shangri-La 4/10-----------------Ok ok this map is a very hard and badly made map. Due to it being so close quartered there is no real good training spots but the fact you have the Baby maker does make it some how survival-able cause its a great weapon. The map itself looks amazing with cool looking textures and a amazing atmosphere with it being all tropical. Overall the fact the map brought cool new stuff like the water and new zombies it makes it enjoyable but it is unlikely to get to a high round on.Moon 3.5/10--------------Moon is one of those maps you really enjoy or dislike. For me its dislike I love the theme of the moon but the fact low gravity really does mess with you as you can bounce back into your train is annoying as hell. This map has a sick Easter egg blowing up the earth and empowering the Aether to Richthofen. The map has a nice feel to it but is annoying spawning on earth then going to the moon and how you have to do this 2 times to get jug unless your a skilled player. A map for people that are better at zombies but still pretty bad due to it being annoying hard to get basics.In the end buying black ops one is a good idea but do buy with all the maps. Its much harder then black ops 2 due to maps just being made worse and harder mainly cause training in most of these maps can be quite a challenge. Overall the game is 36/60 which is worth a buy.
trash.
POSITIVEAmazing storylineUnpredictableGraphics WorldWell made character plotsMakes you feel like your actually a character in the bioshock worldAmazing twistsNEGATIVESDragged onRepetitiveGun UpgradesGameplayKept doing the exact same thing like 10 timesOverall the game had one of the best storylines i-'ve ever seen in games was amazing and had fun with the game.Could of been a bit better in the actual gameplay but I think they did a well enough job with the visual to kind of put that aside. Great ending I loved how the backplot of this game was pretty much -You do something different just a small thing another timeline would be created where you didn-'t do that- Oh though it may be a bit hard to understand it was amazing worth every dollar.9/10
POSITIVEFreddyCan make fun of someone if they get scared by thisCharactersNEGATIVESGraphicsStorylineIts a jumpscareBoringGameplaySlowThis game is crap, its a game which is used for famous youtubers like Pewdiepie to get more 12 year olds to watch his videos. It might be fun or spooky if your like 11 or 12 but I seriously doubt it!Waste of money would rather buy a key!2/10
Reviewing each episode individually then the game as a hole--------------------------------------SPOILERS AHEAD PLUS THE FACT THAT THIS REVIEW WILL BE INFLUENCED BY THE CHOICES I MADE.--------------------------------------SEASON 1Episode 1. 8/10----------------One was definitely my favourite episode. With the introducement to the main characters Jesse, Axel Olivia and Lucas. This sets off as the three friends attempting to build a fireworks stand at a builders tournament and a introduction to the -'Order Of The Stone-' in which the victor gets to meet Gabriel the warrior one of the members of the Order. After all of this crap happens you lose your pig and gotta find him meeting Petra the female feminist empowering character. You and her out to sell a wither skull she has found to the main antagonist Ivory or as I call him -'The Shady Guy-'. After the interview with Gabriel, Ivory builds a Wither in which the flask inorder to control is stolen from your good buddy Axel and the witherstorm gones ape S**t and starts consuming endercon completey. After a chain of events in which you can save Petra or Galbriel you enter the nether after this you find yourself at the Order-'s temple you have to finish puzzles in order to use the amulet Galbriel gave you, oh ye he gives you this magical amulet to track the order. You have to choose to go with Olivia to find Ellegard or with Axel to find Magnus. A great fun episode.Episode 2 6/10-----------In this episode you have to choices I went with Olivia so I will tell the story of Ellegard you find her in her city redstonia in which you have to do some redstone crap and get into her thinking block there you must help her build a command block before the witherstorm comes and flips s**t up yet again. After you return you find Galbriel just chillin in the temple with Lucas. Also Axel went to find the other dude. After this you find the tracker to my boy Soren and attempt to track his footsteps at his temple, The two Order members you picked up get hella mad at each other and leave after you run into Ivory in which you find out he was a former Order member, you engage him in battle until he uses some elixir and runs away trapping you and your buddies in a library. This was an ok episode probs oh though I still reckon it was the worst out of the four.Episode 3 7.5/10-----------In this episode you attempt to find Soren yet again losing the amulet while diging out of the temple finding a mob grinder leads you to the End. In there you find a whole wool world Sorens built and a bunch of enderman he is attempting to make them build. After putting the enderman suit on you try to find him, after finding him he punches you and takes you inside his house. There the enderman siege it and you and your buddies must escape. After coming back to surface you make the Super TNT Crap and Magnus and Ellegard are back together fighting the Witherstorm. There you build the bomb and blow the thing up leading to the death of either Ellegard or Magnus. Getting surviors you see that the command block is not damaged and it starts sucking everything up again yet this time there is 3 of them. Finding either Petra or Galbriel you run away into the next episode. This was a good episode exploring some unique themes of the power of being alone for a long period of time.Episode 4 8/10-----------In this episode you run away from the Witherstorm once again and retreat to a crib in the mountains there you find out that Petra has forgotten everything and doesn-'t remember you. In which you try to figure out stuff about the Witherstorm. Ivory comes along and Soren gets hell mad that the bomb didn-'t work but Ivory figures out to destroy it using a Enchanted sword in which you and some of your buddies have to use the horses to go the -'Far Lands.-' when finally getting there you complete this maze in which it leads you to Ivorys lab there you find out the truth of the Order of the stone and craft the weapon strong enough to destroy the command block in the Witherstorm. After leaving you finally engage the Witherstorm in combat and destroy the command block but not without pay your poor pig Reuben dies. After Galbriel reveals you and your friends are the new -'Order of the stone.-' In the end you can tell to reveal the truth about the order or -Let the people dream.- This episode was sick finally ending the Witherstorm and knowing that nobodies can truly become Legendary.Overall Minecraft story-mode is really fun game with unique character creation semi-predicatable and for a so called -'kids game-' actually pretty dark with touching moments and moments of sorrow and lack of salvation, though the game was pretty quick only took me 7 hours to finish it-'s still a really funny sick game defiantly  worth buying. 7.5/10 (LETS SAY 1-4 IS SEASON 1 REGARDLESS AS IT ALL LINKS TOGETHER.)SEASON 2---- (Will review when all episodes come out.)==
