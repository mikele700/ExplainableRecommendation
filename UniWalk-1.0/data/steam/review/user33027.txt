I suggest keeping away from this game. It has terrible ping correction. I live in Australia, and in my first and only game I was dominated by Russians appearing from out of nowhere and bouncing around or vanishing as they move.Quiet literally I would have people appear right in front of me, no indication where they came from. I also seen Russian players appear and disappear as they moved, and they seemed to be moving far faster than I could. The idea of a faction-based fps game where skill and environmental usage matters is intriguing, but so far it is poorly executed, and impossible to play with other players randomly vanishing, and randomly appearing from out of nowhere. Either it is a fault of the developers coding, or a fault of the players using hacks. Either way, it is no fun, and I suggest keeping away.
