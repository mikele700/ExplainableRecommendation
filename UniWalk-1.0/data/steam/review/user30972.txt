I would have to say what i paid for it, it was worth it becasue I got it on a steam sale. The mouse sensitivaty is realy bad either to sensitive or not sensitive enough. It is an Alpha so i guess it has some excuse.The graphics are ok but i kept getting motion blur even when I turned motion blur off. The way of interacting with things was wierd I mean having to aim at what you wanted to pick up and right clicking making the mouse more sensitive was just weird and hard. But at the moment for an Alpha i find it fun and enjoyable and for $5 I think it has potential and is worth it.
