right payday 2 is a fantastic fun 4 player shooter. you will spend most of your time playing with your friends shooting cops, but some times without friends it can be hard and you will find before your about to type a message in the talk bar, they have already done the thing you were going to tell them not to, this can be frustraighting on stealth missions. it can also be hard if your a high level and the people you are playing with are low and have no idea what there doing. if you talk before the game starts in the chat bar, you have a much better chance of getting the job done easyer. the other option is playing single player with AI, which was no fun at all, the AI team mates are so stupid they just run around in plain sight letting every one know there the're and ruining it for you. playing with friends, talking over steam chat or skype however is one of the best and funneist game times ive had over the years, i couldnt stop myself from laughing. so the bottom line is if your going to get this game, make sure your friends get it as well and you will ave a blast.
fantastic, great fun, with or without friends. but everything is much funner with friends. get it is so adictive the weapon customisation is endless and ITS FREE!!!!!!
best game everand its free
