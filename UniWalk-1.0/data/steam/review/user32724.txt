I haven't been riveted by a game in a while. Papers, Please perfectly appeals to my self-proclaimed great attention to detail. It's proven its case by showing that my attention to detail isn't that great after-all (well, when put to a timer). The aesthetic of the game harks back to what I imagine to be Cold War-era Eastern Europe, with tensions high between borders, controlling governments, and a lack of humanity to the common peon.Gameplay is fun, and endearing. The aesthetic is simple, but effective. Border control is somehow made to be amusing. The challenge of stamping passports is slowly increased as more conditions are dictated by the Ministry of Admission. A healthy dose of humour is inserted sporadically by the oddball characters that come your way. The drollness of it all is broken up by the occasional click-and-shoot, and the RPG-style strategising of managing your family's finances (ha!). The game's multiple endings and achievements ensures some replayability.In a gaming world dictated by first person shooters and multiplayer battle arenas, it's hard to say who Papers, Please might appeal to. There is a touch of simulation gaming about it, without it being realistic at all. Again, I found the game compelling, and was sucked in for a few hours on the first run. Definitely check it out, if you even suspect that it might be down your alley.
Getting AWPed from a pixel across the map = ah, great sniping.Getting headshot AWPed from 1 metre away when I thought I had managed to surprise rush them = FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU0/10, would play again.
Hard as balls.
