better then supreme commander 2. 10/10
fabulous game. its a great combination of other zombie survival games. it throws in base building as seen in Rust and other voxel-based games. it has many gameplay mechanics similiar to DayZ(if not better) and you'll spend hours crafting various guns, melee and tool items as it has the most in-depth crafting I've ever seen. only downside is that random gen can make it a walking sim and no vehicle transport. 8/8
amazing game. 9 years old and still a great game, if you can play with friends you can have a good time. definatly worth buying.
