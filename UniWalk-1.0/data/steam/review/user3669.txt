I didn-'t know anything about Wolfenstein at all when I started playing this game, but I can easily say that all I want now is more. I played through on the -'hard-' difficulty and found myself challenged and needing to think about my moves throughout the whole game. No aspects were too easy, but neither did any aspect feel as if the AI was -cheating-.Great story arc, great characters, and excellent combat.10/10, I crave more from the Wolfenstein universe.
