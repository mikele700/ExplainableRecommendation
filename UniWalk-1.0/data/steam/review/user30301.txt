Just Cause 3 could have been one of, if not, the funnest games  of 2015. However this game suffers form massive performance issues. Keep in mind I am running a Nvidia GT 750 TI, and I know this is not a great GPU but I did expect to run this game at high settings. The performance issues I have incountered in my roughly 4 hours include:~ Last time I booted up the game I experianced a loading time that took over 10 MINUTES to get into the actual game.~ At sometimes it would tank below 15 FRAMES making it unplayable.~Many audio issues.~Issues unpausing after leaving the game idle.~And while swimming I swam through the map causing me to drownThese are the problems that I have experianced but I've seen online that there are many, MANY more issues with this PC port. It is a shame as this game could have been one of my games of the year but instead like Arkham Knight the performance ruined my experiance. this pains me as a fan of the series, having completed both previouse Just Cause titles. I know it's not only Avalanche but for me it was the straw that broke the camels back this needs to stop in the gaming industry and is an unacceptable practice.
The best value for 99 cents.Also the best dinosaur game ATM.
