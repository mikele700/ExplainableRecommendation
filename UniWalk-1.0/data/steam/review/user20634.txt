When I saw the game's trailer i wasn't that hyped as black ops 2. When I got to play it on free weekend it said it required a directX 11 card when I could've just modified the graphics file like what thelowspecgamer said but there wasn't because again no directX 11 card on my laptop 1 year later I bought the game for $30 (idk what it is in Aud) and it ran at 40 fps on my Intel i7 4600U with 8 gb of ramAfter playing a while I wanted to keep playing just to get the purifierAnd therefore I refunded the game for no ♥♥♥♥ing reason because I have a better game to buyHunie I mean counter strike ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s offensiveThis was a joke
