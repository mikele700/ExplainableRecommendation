Loved this game, took a long time to complete. Great story and characters. The few things I did not enjoy though was the amount of time spent walking, often you will find yourself walking back and forth between areas just holding down W and looking around your room. Also selling things is a nightmare as they aren't categorized into junk and such like in Witcher 2. Great game none the less and I would strongly recommend it.9/10 Would buy at full price.
