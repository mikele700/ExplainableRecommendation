Rust, well I could go on and write an essay on why you should buy this game but just to give a few poinbt and keep it short i would like so share ssome of my experieences and thoughts. My first 3 hours or so i was lucky enough to be left alone with no contact with any other players, I learnt how to craft and build my first shack where i made a campfire and hid inside of till daylight. I was playing with one of my friends and we found each other after about those 3 hours, I learnt the basics of the game within that time and managed to make a starting weapon and go on to hunting.Ok rust has issues and bugs here and there, but although it is only in alpha it is one of the best games i have played, on my second realtime day of playing rust i made 2 new friends and next thing you know we all built together hunted together and ofcorse raided less fortunate players together.My most memorable moment is when me and this group of mine we all sprinting through the pitch black night, armed to the teeth with weapons, armor and explosives, all you could see were our lazer pointers and flashlight atatchments, we arrived at a base 5x the sive of ours and with many c4 explosives we broke through and found the mother of all loot, we killed the people that were asleep and destroyed their sleeping bags, Harsh? we know, but after playing rust for a couple hours u will relise its survival of the fittest.Overall 20$ for a game that is only in alpha stage and has so much potential??? i think so, u would be insane to pass this offer.
