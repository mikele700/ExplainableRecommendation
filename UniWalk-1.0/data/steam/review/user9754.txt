Absolutely pathetic attempt to milk me. Seriously guys, this game was good. Was. but now the stat skins and ♥♥♥♥ like, its ruined it. I was /okay/ with the DLC amount, but now its just pathetic. Good game, bad path. Rest in peace.
This game is a really awesome twist on space combat. With 8 ships at your disposal, all different, it suits lots of play styles. Id say get the game while its cheap(er). Knowing the future it will become more expensive. SO get it and blow up other people.
