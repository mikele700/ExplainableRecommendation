7.8/10 would throw bags and fix drills again
A REALLY under the radar indie game now on steam. Greay levels, excellent level editor and just plain fun. it's one of those games where you stop playing because you realized that 3 hours has passed and you need to eat something. Heaps of replay value and the fact that this is an early APHLA means a promising future for this game. If you like having fun, PLAY THIS GAME
Almost certainly the definitive version of the game. Amazing graphics, runs smooth with little to no drops in FPS (for me at least), great story and gameplay. It does take a little bit to load onto online servers, but when you so get on it is well worth the wait. Loads of content and gamemodes to keep you playing for hoursWell worth the price.      9.5/10
