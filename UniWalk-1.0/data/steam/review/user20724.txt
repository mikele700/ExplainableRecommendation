A very fun, moddable game. I would highly suggest the main game and the modded modes as well. There is a lot on this $10 game, and you can never get bored of it.
They've sent the entire world population to kill us, even babies are now cops. Too bad we killed them all.10/10
Only just bought the game but so far, I can see why it's rated so well - great script and storyline. However, battle mechanics in my opinion are way too clunky. See for yourself - but I don't recommend it.
This game should be about balance.There is no balance.mlg/10
A really really bad game. Has models basically ported from Halo, really really bad mechanics and bad sounds. Would not recommend. Though, it's so bad, it's actually funny.
There is a lot in this $15 game, and fans of action RPGs should really take a look at it. I highly suggest it.
