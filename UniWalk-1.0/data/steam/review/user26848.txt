Great game, although a bit complicated so you might need someone to help you, but i guess thats what the tutorial is for. I played the heck out of it and lets just say my other gaming computer won't be playing it again..
This game. This game will make you work, experiment, cry, rage and tonnes more.On DST me and m friends only last to about day 6 because of HORRIBLE luck (I jumped in a wormhole w my friend and saw 18 hounds btw).Although its SO amazing.10000000/10 Would hound again.
