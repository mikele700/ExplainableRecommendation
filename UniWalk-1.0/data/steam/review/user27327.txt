I bought this game on sale for 10 cents. I bought this game due to needing to spend money to get the marketplace available, I was never going to touch this game until I saw it had cards and I decided I could make a few cents off this game. I was pleasantly surprised by how fun this game turned out to be, the gameplay is extremely fun and makes up for the lackluster graphics.
