Destiny Warriors is a fantastic RPG spin-off with a uniqe take on the -Save the world- genre so many of us love.You start as a school boy in a small town who has almost completed his ninja training, while it-'s hard to go into too much detail without spoiling the plot it-'s quite fun, as you explore more levels you can also upgrade your equipment/stats and keep your favorite items in your inventory.Overall score: ★★★★★ out of ★★★★★ stars!Story: 10/10Graphics: 9/10Gameplay/mechanics: 10/10 (Has a very nice feel to the inventory/equipment managment which I like).Combat Mechanics: 10/10 (Very well done inventory/items/stat management)Music/sound: 9/10
Gotta save them all!
