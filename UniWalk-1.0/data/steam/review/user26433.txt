This game is like a beautiful Megaman recreation.Everything about this game is amazing. Its got tight controls, interesting and challenging level design, and a story that makes no sense but is awesome anyways. Though the learning curb can be steep, once you learn how to hold down whilst in mid air, you should be fine :)
