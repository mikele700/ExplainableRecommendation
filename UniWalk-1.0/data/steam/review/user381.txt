This Game is very addictive and fun to play its cost no more than 0.0 and and is free to play. I give a 10/10
Great Game, has a good concept zombie apocalypse and pvp. But it's very unoptimized and at some time unplayable. the devs need to put work into this game. Once 0.60 comes out the game will be a even better game and hopefully people will return backl to this game :)
