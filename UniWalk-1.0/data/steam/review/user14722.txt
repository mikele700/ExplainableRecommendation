Deer Man is one of the most unique games I have probably ever played.  Very different style to its genre (I don't think the game really even has one) but for such a short storyline, there are some really deep concepts and emotions.  A bit confusing at times in terms of directions and controls but for a $2-3 dollar game its definitely worth it.  **SPOLER**May or may not have ♥♥♥♥ myself when the Deer Man first chases you to the house.
