it done brokeded on me, the game no longer works for some reason, i clikc play to open the game and it runs the csgo.exe thing and it shows up on my  task bar (mac) but then it says instantly that the program isn't responding and just sits there and doesn't do anything. i tried validating the game files and it came back with a missing/not found/corrupt (not sure which one, didn't specify) and then it said that it would go fetch it again, so i ran the game and then closed it after it didn't work again and then validated the files once more and it came back as all files being accounted for... so i'm pretty bumbed out coz i love playing csgo and wanted to chill this arvo but no, thanks steam, i really appreciate it man <3
It's an amazing game, and im glad that mac users can finally play it to :DNOw, does anyone know if it's possible to import worlds into your game, and if so how? also i use the mac and linux open beta so i was wandering if it's possible for that version of the game, thanks if anyone replies and if you do can you type the file directory so i can use the go to folder feature, thanks :P
