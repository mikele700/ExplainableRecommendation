10/10 Best turtle hunting simulator I've played yet.
*Clears throat* This is a really good game but forget any hopes and dreams of getting the multiplayer achievements because it's dead. Completely dead. Rest in peace multiplayer, gone and probably forgotten. Still, 10/10 would recommend this game for the single player.
Still fun and all, but the recent updates are ruining it :/
This game is a work of art <3
Found the man in the cage and then killed him.10/10 would play again.
Get out of the broom closet Stanley.
