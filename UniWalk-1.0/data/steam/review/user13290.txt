i had to do this to not lose at a game, but two thumbs up though (Y)
Very Good game, almost a terraria style roguelike.You start out in a jungle filled with pigs and slime but dont look down on it for that those pigs are harcore.Craft! Survive! Kill! Win! Die... probably a lot, BUT NEVERMIND THAT, ONWARD! TO GLORY! AND BACON!
sah good. get this.
Finishing this game left a hole in my heart, mechanically polished and with a story that is utterly compelling. murderous rampages ensue... or do they?
Potentially rage inducing, potentially gleeful maniacal laughter inducing. often both within minutes and seconds of each other, play if you enjoy rougelikes. dont play if you get invested in characters, spoilers, they dont make it much.
This could almost be titled -Diablo 3, the mechanical sequal- it is truer to diablo 2 in how you play than the -real diablo 3- with the ammendum of a STARMAP OF ATTRIBUTES! THERE ARE NO TREES HERE INSTEAD YOU GET A UNIVERSE OF CHOICE!
Solid game, it gets a little repetitive but the audio is simply epic.
This game is amazing, but be warned it is also far far far to addictive.
This is a great game, just doing one of its THREE game modes i burnt over 300 hours!
