this is kind of the first time playing it so this will be a first impressionthe story is pretty good i enjoyed it and it was interesting, lots of characters, average weapons but this is the start of the game so i say it pretty good but and a BIG BUTthe controls felt clunky and often led to my death, often fighting against the controls, wall jumping was extremely odd and felt really weird, blocking was USELESS, tutorial... what tutorial???, they dont explain things such as some magic abilities and enemies and the mana keys, there is an odd rush of bosses that often leave you un-prepared and often feeling not ready for them (they also rank you for the bosses) and the map is kinda useless as well... so yeh i didnt really have a fun time
