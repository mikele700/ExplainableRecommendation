For a Free to Play FPS this really does outdo itself in all areas. Everything about it matches that of a common AAA quality $60 game. Graphics, Gameplay, and Level Design are all amazing. This game really does set the bench mark for future Free to Play FPS's.
Fantastic WWII FPS that involves team work, strategy, and works away from the Modern Shooter Cliche.
Great game for an Alpha version.
