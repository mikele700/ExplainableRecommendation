good game lel just like minecraft but 2d and better in every way10/10
This game is amazing. Its just like rust only with dino's. The graphics are fantastic when i play on medium and i have barely any problem running this game.There are also quite a few issues as it is an early alpha game like me walking through rocks sometimes but the game is still great10/10
Great game but on the market like WTF?? Gun with cool skin = $10. Add numbers to it = $10010/10 would waste my money again =)
Great game, Nice graphics and storyline. Has a bit of difficulty added to it which is good and so is the whole concept of choosing a god to worship.Just with The Beast F'taga, He shouldn't be as hard as he is, non-stop attacking and knockback which makes him very hard to attack, if the Beast was a bit easier it would be more enjoyable
