Everytime I think of this game, I think of it's beauty, it's story and it's characters. Not only does it get a 10/10 from me, it also makes me shed tears at every little surprise it springs up. GG Walking Dead, you're the first game to make me cry.
Look at my hours, it stole that much away from my life with this :P.
A wonderful game to play it certainly makes you stop and think when it comes to ammo preserving and where to hit them and what hits them extremely well, the beauty alone is simply amazing.
The game is great with it's images and storylineIt provides an environment to interact with and chooseThe only downside is, the game itself is too short, and as much as I liked the game itselfI am kind of disappointed about only getting roughly 2 hours worth of dialouge, sure it's great don't get me wrong but, 2 hours? I really wish it was more then 2 hours worth of interesting stuff but oh well, it was alright but the only thing I would have to complain about besides the shortness of it is the cost of it, for 2 hours worth of gameplay I think at least it could be $5.
Simply..♥♥♥♥ing..Amazing..And..A..Pain..
