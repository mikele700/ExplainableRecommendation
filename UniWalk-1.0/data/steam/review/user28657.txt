this is a great game, it's not that much like the sequel team fotress 2 (which is still better than this) and one of the things I love about this is that it has the classic 90's style graphics and is not a money grabbing hat - war simulation game.When I play this i feel like I have traveled back in time to 1999 playing this game because of it's classic style graphics. I personally love this game.
it is one of the best car games i have ever seen, bugbear entertainment inc. have done a great job creating this game and has taken car games to the next generation.C'mon! everyone loves to smash cars right!?
