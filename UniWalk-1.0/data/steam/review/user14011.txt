What the ♥♥♥♥ it runs at 30fps. This game looks worse than ♥♥♥♥ing arkham origins and runs so much worse, crashes and stutters. The batmobile is fun when you get above 50fps (from the .ini file fix), but you don't on open ground which sucks, the combat is really fun, but I'd recommend  just playing custom maps from city.
