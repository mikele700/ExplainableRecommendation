Another great game from teltale (the makers of the walking dead games) the wolf among has a similair gameplay as the walking dead adventure games so for people who played them they will feel right at home but its easy enough for new players to understand and it has a fantastic story (i cant wait for the next two chapters) and it has a great clifhangar at the end of each one that will have you begging for more this would have to be 10/10
This is the best open-world survial games every to be released its just one of the best games to be released even though its still in early access and its got some game breaking bugs its so amazing and fun escpically with friends and they add new things constantly so you always got a new thing to try and do. The best.
Along with the walking dead season 1 for the year 2013 this was by far one of the greatest with a amazing story that you will remember for years and some pretty good combat and a great varriety of weapons (i mostly stuck with the sniper and shotgun) it truly is 10/10
This is by far one of the greatest game of 2013 the story is incredible and every second is hooking and exciting and intence and stressful (in a good way) this is a stunning game 10/10
