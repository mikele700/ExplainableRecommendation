From Jeff Smith's graphic novel to a telltale game chapter in the TTG bible. The story is three bone cousins Fone Bone, Phoney Bone, and Smiley Bone get seperated from each other and Fone discovers a vally full of crazy creatures. The game is amazing and the charaters in this game are memarable: Like Ted the Bug, The Great red dragon, and the Stupid, Stupid Rat creatures!! I give this game 9/10
good game for family guy fans
Can Someone steam gift this game?
The sequel to episode 1 and I have to say, MOVE OUTTA WAY STICK OF TRUTH!!! AN OLD TIMER IS HITTING THE STREET!!!Yeah I don't like the stick of truth, but no offence this game and episode 1 is WAY better than the stick of truth, The game macanics (Message me if i spelt it wrong) are the same from episode 1: Create you charater, Battle enemies and Watch you charater in 2D cutscenes, I give this game 10/10
Penny arcade adventures episode 1 is a good game, you can customize you charater and watch cutscenes with you charater in them, I give this game 9.5 out of ten
