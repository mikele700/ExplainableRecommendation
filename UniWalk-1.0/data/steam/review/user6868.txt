Pure, unadulterated fun.
Free to play is very far from the truth. Free to download is a more fitting description. It looks like a great game, but if you need a membership from the get go, and it's nearly impossible to obtain one quickly, it just makes for an unenjoyable experience.
The creatures you are able to create in this game is a selling point in itself, but gameplay is simple, fun and really rewarding!
