The game turned from fun and games to BUY THIS TO UNBOX THIS FOR WHICH YOU NEED TO BUY THIS in 1 failed updateI am 11/10 dissapointed -Mr. Foster
Increase the range of the Bolt Action rifle and add a semi-sniper scope with a little magnification.Overall its a really fun game with great building and crafting mechanics, really well-made animations and models, a great concept between DayZ and Minecraft.
You know what? ♥♥♥♥ you, after playing this game for quite some time, i decided that i regret spending my money on it, mainly because of how poorly the developers work on this game, compared to most other titles. They even silence reviews, as i heard, ban people for playing music on Brian Hicks-' stream and then deny it while blocking the banned person-'s posts on forums and even Reddit with all the evidence that he needed to prove himself.The devs should-'ve kept progress with the mod, not start afresh with a full game that has been in alpha for 2 years.You guys promised us so much yet you keep working on entirely different aspects, then put a big lable -Early Access- as an excuse for slow development
