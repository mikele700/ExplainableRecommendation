In your face, Assault Horizon! I get to do close combat RIGHT in this game and it's more intense than deceitful camera magic!Vector Thrust also fills a niche as to aerial combat (arcade) simulation in vector thrust capable aircraft. Here's hoping in the future for a realistic simulation of vector thrust capable aircraft of quality comparable against Falcon X.0 and DCS! :D
Despite being a 'Pre-Alpha', Robocraft has garnered an active playerbase.There's more than just building blocks; the way you arrange your block connections (known as triforcing) to redirect damage away from critical vehicle parts such as guns, electroplate stacking, and even mounting guns on guns!The construction possibilities are endless; gotta learn 'em all!
