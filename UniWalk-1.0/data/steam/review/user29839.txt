Invisible zombies, teleporting zombies, zombies that can walk thru walls, zombies that can attack thru walls, zombies can hear you 50m away and can see you 400m away, BROKEN ZOMBIES, framerate issues, teleporting players, dieing for no apparent reason, breaking legs from falling 1cm, breaking legs from running in a straight line, character moans in a sexual manner when sick, BROKEN ZOMBIES, character is a fat f uck and is always hungry, connection issues, character is always cold despite being a fat f uck, character eats food and drinks water like he has a f uckin jaw impediment, BROKEN ZOMBIES, and the WORST PART is it's exactly like the original mod in EVERY WAY except for improved graphics, added items and a few other minor changes (for better and worst), oh yeah and the zombies are a f uck ton more broken in the standalone.If the devs spent as much time fixing the mechanics of the game then adding new items and s hit I could recommend this game, however considering it has been more than a year and a half in alpha and many elements of the game are still broken I would adivise gamers who have played the original mod to not to purchase the DAYZ standalone yet, as they are too similar for the $35 prince tag of the standalone.
