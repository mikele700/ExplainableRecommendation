Looks better in the trailer, but it's fine. It's like a free version of Contagion.
It's pretty nice for an alpha game, hoping more exciting updates!Good points:*Cool tribe system*Great dinosaur taming *Good animations*Do not need a boosted PC to play*It's a nice past-time*Nice multiplayer*Updates come oftenBad points:*It's boring when you die and you need to craft all the things again*Kidnapping is weird O_O*Rain everytime
Primal Carnage + CS + TF2 + realistic dinosaurs =
