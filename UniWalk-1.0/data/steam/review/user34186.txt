Simple as gameplay. You move your character left and right with the arrow keys, stand in a shadow and catch the hat (or fridge) on your head. Eventually you'll find minigames in between levels that change the game up a bit, stockpile hats that you can use to spend on 'skins' for characters and acquire gifts like a swear jar that throws obscenities at your face everytime you catch a hat.Like I said, simple as. Its got some replayability.7/10 its aight.
