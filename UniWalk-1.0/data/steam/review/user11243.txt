Xenonauts takes the classic UFO enemy unknown game that entertained so many early PC gamers and makes it accessible for a whole new generation. Far deeper than the (still enjoyable) Firaxis Xcom remake, Xenonauts returns base building and a deep research tree, as well as base assault and defence and far higher levels of customisation.A great game!
