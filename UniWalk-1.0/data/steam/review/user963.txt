Great concept, but extremely bad execution.What was fun: social aspect and level of co-op either with friends and matchmaking (sometimes).What wasn't: unprofessional dev attitude, rushed release hence bugs, glitches, and hackers. To top it off, loot system is extremely broken.Avoid this on PC, hackers galore. Developers have had no concrete response to tackling hackers. In fact hackers have no fear playing this and posting their hacking videos on YT. Developers enforce a 3 day ban followed by permanent ban but are being circumvented by hackers simply changing their names. Glitching has been rampant for a while now, and no actions have been taken to resolve this issue also, which means most people are OP in PvP. There are also so many bugs relating to connection, the quality of servers are intermittent at best, while several of the talents do not even work. In fact, sometimes they are the oppostite. The attitude of Ubisoft and Massive are: close threads down of anyone posting any negative feedback, while communicating the absolute minimum: the silence indicates that this game is in trouble. The fact that vendor blueprints are more exciting that loot drops is alone a sign of a completely broken game.I thought I'd be proven wrong by forking out early and getting the GOLD and Season pass, but I regret this. Apart from the extremely brief social co-op experience this game provided, the only other positive that I've gotten out of this game is to never every buy a game and season pass that Massive/Ubisoft have laid their dirty little fingers on.
