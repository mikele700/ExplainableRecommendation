joined a server...got kicked 10/10 but seriously pros fun gameplay nice community fun gamemodes cons cooldowns from getting kicked due to a vac error campers noobs being mixed in with pros
really enjoyable and fun pros fun combattradingmost of the community mvm cons some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s dominations from 3 or 4 kills 
this game only gets better with how creative you are
you can punch people really hard in the face and somehow not kill them 10/10
dont get this game the community is dead no one plays it anymore
its ok :D
this game is the best rpg ive ever played
