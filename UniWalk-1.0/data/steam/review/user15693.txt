Farming, Dungeons, lets be honest its all about the fishing ;)One of those games where as soon as you start the game you a free to do anything you are willing to do, slow start but gets to the point later on where you are having dinner at home and all of a sudden you ask yourself -Is that the sun coming up?-This game just chews your life away and it is worth every hour you put into it, so many things to do so little time amazing game totally worth $15A friend reccomended this to me i had no idea about it and I-'ve enjoyed every little bit of it :)
