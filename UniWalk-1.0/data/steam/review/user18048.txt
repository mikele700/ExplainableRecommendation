Great game, recommend it for people who like surviving games.
I was driving in a SUV with someone when hear 'ALLAHU AKBAR' in a building, i check out the building, guess they were some crazy serial killers on the lose.10/10 would drive in a car with a stranger lel
Very fun to play with, especially with friends, although the graphics are kinda high so if you have a bad PC then this might cause delays, an ways great game and I recommend it.8/10
