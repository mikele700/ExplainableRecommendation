Read an article about this game where the dev put out 'pirated' version of his own game with a patch included in it, that made popular games get pirated.  reading the comments from people compaining about their pirated game being pirated was hilarious, so went and bought the game immediatley.great fun, very different than anything i've played before, well worth getting.link to article:http://www.greenheartgames.com/2013/04/29/what-happens-when-pirates-play-a-game-development-simulator-and-then-go-bankrupt-because-of-piracy/
