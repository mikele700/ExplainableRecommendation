I Recomend this game to everyone, but I am a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about 1 thing....!I Pre-Ordered this game because I am a HUGE South Park fan, I started watching the show when I was 6 years old, back when it was first showed on TV. This game is made for people who are 18 years and older. The question I have is why is this game a -low violence version- it is only for people 18 years and older. I understand its because its pretty full on. Being an adult means you have access to Uncensored stuff, adult movies, guns, etc. But why is this game censored for adults who paid good money for something that should not be censored. The logic makes no sence. Even the South Park TV show is Uncensored at MA+15. Why Censore a game at R+18? This is absolutely Outrageous. ITS SOUTHPARK. COME ON. PATCH IT SO IT IS UNCENSORED!
This game is SERIOUSLY worth getting. It is the best carnage car game I have ever played. It is really realistic and absolutely 200% fun. If you like to smash the absolute crap out of everything, then this is the game for you. The only words I think I can best describe this game by is. Entertaining, Satisfying, Wonderful. It is awesome. I recommend this game to anyone who likes racing games, and if they love it, Demolition Derby games. I know I barg alot about it, but I only do that because there is a hell of a lot to brag about. And its still being developed. I say good work. I love this game. 10/10.
