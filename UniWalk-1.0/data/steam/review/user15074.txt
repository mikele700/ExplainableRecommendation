After my 384 hours I decided that it is probably a good idea to write a review, so where should I begin.This game is amazing, it looks like Terraria but for ♥♥♥♥s sakes it is NOTHING like Terraria, ever wanted to be an medieval archer sniping on top of a tower picking off those petty nubs?? You know what makes it better? Someone built that tower! As a builder you build traps,towers, workshops,trampoline cannons???,swastikas,boats,catapaults,balistas,boulder artillery and the list goes on and on and on. As a knight your pull your sword and slice down your enemys, bomb jump over their walls, drop a keg on there asses, knock their tower that took them ages to make down, steal there flag and take it back to your base and win the game. Oh! and the modding community is huge so theres even more crazy ♥♥♥♥ to screw around with.This game is a must have. Get it.
So Starbound what is there to say about it?Starbound is my favourite 2D survival platformer, Well actully Terraria is the only other one I know of but still.When Starbound was released I was a little disapointed at how buggy it was, but apart from that the abilly to fly to other planets, mechs and other tech, the random derpy monsters and the really cool randomly generated buildings and dungeons just made me fall in love.
