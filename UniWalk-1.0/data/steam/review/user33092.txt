The game mechanics are thus far enjoyable with only a few annoying quirks (like needing a skill to charge Ki)The character customization is limited though doesn't feel restricted especially with all the possible outfits one can buy throughout the game.The most annoying thing would be the need to play with Steam offline due to the issues DBX is having with its servers as of late which hopefully won't put many people off. Still yet to try the online Capabilities!You will want to purchase a PC controller before playing though as using the mouse and keyboard for a Dragonball Fighting game (unless you've not picked one up since 1998) feels unnatural and is honestly a waste of time.The story mode doesn't feel recycled even though it is a blatant (Hey we can still get away with old stories whilst making it new) although does contradict certain explanations through the series for how things work (Like changing the past) but thats easily forgiven when you meet the Original Characters in the game.Honestly if you liked every other Dragon Ball game out there I'd say you're going to love this one, same stuff, different port with all the added benifites! Though if you're a girl I'm sorry but no female Nemekian or Frieza's clan for you :c just no canon genders </34/5
For those who enjoy cutting, shooting, bashing, slaughtering everyone I highly suggest this game. It also includes secrets and a story that will keep you wanting moreAlso a great game to play with the upcoming Miami Hotline 2 being released in the first quarter of 2015. play the original first!
