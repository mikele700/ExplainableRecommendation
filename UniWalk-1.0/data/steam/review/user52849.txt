Visually stunning and interesting of course, but that can only carry a game so far, exploring becomes tedious and dull after a while as the puzzles don't really evolve much beyond the flipping perspective mechanic and the areas are connected in a confusing mazelike fashion that just left me feeling unsure of where to go and not really motivated to bother methodically searching around, maybe this just isn't my sort of game but I can't recommend it
Not really that interesting honestly, the visual style is kind of meh although that might be because of age, the gameplay is simple and isn't really used in very interesting ways, it overall just really gives the same vibe as overly simplistic mobile games, if you're not the sort of person to get into games like Angry Birds then I wouldn't get this game
Very difficult, but satisfyingly so, if I game gets too frustrating I usually just give up but this game sucks you in like quicksand, the more you try to leave the harder it becomes to do so as you get desperate to do better then you did before, controls are flawless, visuals are pleasing, the music is amazingly well done and fittingly atmospheric and you can chose whether the damsels you rescue are a woman, a man, or a pug, A+
The only fault I can give this game is how much it overexaggerates the fun you can actually have with a shovel, top notch visuals, sound, gameplay and writing, maybe a little bit short but there's even more game on the way in the form of free updates, definitely beats shovelling dirt
Very satisfying roguelike (or lite or whatever) platformer that will keep your children coming back for more, controls are tight and customizable to fit your preferred playstyle, exploring the castle, fighting enemies and searching for treasure is constantly addictive even after you've died and died and died again, and the music is kickass, highly recommend
Short but oh so sweet, Portal is an all time classic that I probably don't even need to bother reviewing at all really, immensely satisfying to play, look at, listen to and be insulted by, highly recommend
You're not going to get much more than what you see here, but what there is is a well made extremely tight 2D platformer fencing simulator that is extremely fun to play with friends, maybe not as interesting against a CPU, recommend picking it up on sale because that price is pretty high for something with so little meat, even if it is quite tasty
The single player is short but very fun, manages to pack in quite an interesting story for such a compact game too, and the game itself plays really well, lots of tight stealthy action, with a suave visual/audio style and plenty of freedom to decide how you go about solving each level, plus a level editor to keep you coming back for even more
The clipart-esque graphics aren't the most appealing and the lack of a narrator makes playing through the story levels less interesting, but it's still just as well made and fun to play of a physics puzzle game as it's spiritual ancestors, with more bits and bobs and more to come if it keeps getting updated
The story kind of peters out without knowing what to do with itself and the grid assembled level layouts can end up feeling somewhat samey and uninteresting, but it's fun to play, controls great, looks and sounds good in a simple cartoony style, the cutscenes are hilarious, and it has a lot of personalization and fun multiplayer modes
