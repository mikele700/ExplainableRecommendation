THe best game a lot more to do im into simulations and so far this is the best, the new feature Woodcutting which i have had experience with in the Forestry mod for 2013 i really like the whole new feature, it does take a long time to make money but thats life.
This is the next generation of a platformer space travel game with a lot of different monsters and planets.
Its awesome, its like a gta based in the 40s-50s/60s after the WWII
