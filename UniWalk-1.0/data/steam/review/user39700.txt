Like stealing jewellery without ever being caught? if so, buy this game!9/10 would stealth again
Honestly doesnt deserve all the bad reviews, it's good. This game will capture a certain audience and leave out everyone inbetween. Dont get upset when it's not what you thought it'd be.
it was actually good, way back in the day when it had potential. I miss those days, I miss the old Godus. It's essentially dead now but if they ever decided to make a revamped version and try sell it i'd probablty be hopeful and get burnt
