Valve is a very generous company. To release free, professional standard animating software that has created many oppertunies among us, the community, to dive into more than just the game. I admit, it can be very confusing and almost daunting for new comers of SFM but once you get your head wrapped around the basics, you can get straight into the more complex areas! It provides people like me ( borderline broke ) a source of creative software which isn't a scam or disgustingly cheap. Thank you valve, I reccomend this.
dis game is gewd u bai hatz n stuff
Reccomended, but a fair warning. If you want to become serious about being a competitive player then be ready to pour your life and soul into this game, and encounter people who think they can play it 100 times better than you. If you can work through this, and find a capable group of friends who you enjoy playing with, I envy you.
It's good, however hold off from buying it as off now. The enemies in this game aren't really 'fleshed out' in the sense they're just red versions of the other animals. The devs are currently rebuilding the game, and I wouldn't expect to many updates on Rust itself right now, most of it is going to the Dev edition (or whatever you wanna call it) volvo pls
