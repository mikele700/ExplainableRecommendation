COH is so fun,ive played it since day 1 of coh 1 and never stoped i have over 4000 hours.COH 2 is awesome but units are squishier harder to keep alive plus grenades that you cant see and have no timer can wipe a whole unit out,and they can throw em a very long distance almost out of the screen...and german tanks are not OP you just need to learn how to fight against them...
if you want to go back to the ww2 war and fight in it?then this is your game, its just amazing, but very realistic, multiplayer is not for weak gamers that sook about getting owned only for the tuff that can take a beating to give a beating...
