I did not know what to expect when I started this game. But I can say that I was pleasantly surprised. Within Dustforce DX is some of the most precise, well-constructed 2D platforming that you can experience. Its unique concept and fair set-up allows you to enjoy the game, no matter what your skill level. This is especially true provided the time and score system. If I were to provide a negative quirk, it would be the key system and hub which is not entirely user-friendly, and does become a bit of a hassle when transversing from stage-to-stage. Otherwise, it is a fun experience and I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys a challenging 2D platformer.
I am Bread is a good game.Edit: Except for the Epilogue which is buggier than the Antz, The Bee Movie and Bug's Life combined.
I don't regret the purchase, but I'm not particularly happy.However, I did learn a lot. Will continue taking notes, and implementing it to real-life.
Stanley had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow. No-one had showed up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say Hi. Stanley had been sitting at his monitor, staring at the review button on Steam. Scared, frightened, an order finally appeared. He breathed a sigh of relief as he was presented with two pressable buttons, to which Stanley would press the 'Yes' button.The button lit up with a magnificent glow, bathing Stanley in self-satisfaction. Stanley would then sit for hours waiting for the next prompt to appear. Although it did little to progress the review, Stanley would entertain himself with the various formatting, visibility and language options available. Grande recensione! Finally, Stanley realised there was a 'Post review' button, and laughed at himself for missing it earlier. 'Oh there it is! That's the button!' exclaimed Stanley, as he pressed it with palpable excitement.
