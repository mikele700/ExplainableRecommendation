The game is OK with friends, story is mediocre and voice acting is sub-par, I wouldn't advise solo play as it get difficult to defeat enemies.So if you're thinking about buying the game, buy just ep 1 and test it for yourself/friends
The game is good, but theres just too much grinding involved (terraforming simulator)
