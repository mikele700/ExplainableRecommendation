First of all would not have thought i would like this game. But just the suspense at the final 30km in the race keeps me wanting to do 1 more race.Pros* Graphics* Gameplay* Community to help with name and team database.* Length to finish just 1 yearCons* Online (Theres either not many people on or i dc pretty quickly)* I'm a casual player and easy isn't that easy.
I have enjoyed this game so far.Likes:         - Customisation         - Quick Match Making         - Easy to play         - variety in game playDislikes         - Pretty much pay to get to the high tiers         - Ppl dont communicate in battle I played for a bit then spent $10aud for 10000gc and 3 days premium, and it seems you would have to keep paying to get higher tiers unless you like grinding. I recommend it even if you just stay in the lower tiers.
