this is one of my most played games and i love it so much
amazingly fun game that never gets boring and it is my favourite game atm and i recommend it to anyone for a cheap fun game
it is good
You can get a lot out of this game, counting it's free it is very good, and I like it. Another similar game that is free and good is Fistfull of Frags.
EXCELLENT game for multi player and single player and can compete with CSGO and other bigger titles, and this is free. I also like the pistol to pistol gameplay, and I also like the fact that there is no automatic guns, like SMGs. GREAT GAME!!!
This, my friends, is the ten dollar buy. If you buy this, I recommend getting the orange box, as you get every half life 2 game, portal, and a hat in tf 2. Fantastic!
