Shoot people, shoot chickens, stab people, stab chickens.This game makes you really angry and really happy at the same time.The graphics are great even at low, and the community is actually fun to play with.It is very teambased and takes a while to learn so I recommend you start off playing with friends.Overall a great game where you can kill people and chickens alike.

Amazing graphics, amazing storyline, great voice acting, legendary combat, Dust: An Elysian Tail has it all.
