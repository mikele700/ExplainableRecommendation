An awesome sequel and an awsome game. A challenging puzzler that doesnt quite destroy your mind (until you start doing community test chambers!!!). The story is unique and interesting, and with the introduction of co-op and community test chambers, the fun doesn't stop after the main campaign! A must have for any game library.
