Influent is quite basic in nature with the simple objective of walking around a small 4 room apartment clicking on objects to learn their pronounciation in any given target language. Although it hosts this extremely simplistic goal it really does a sucessful job at drawing the players attention in and making them want to learn. It is notable that Influent isn't going to form you into some language speaking master capable of conversing in any language but it does provide a solid baseline in which you can form your grammatical understanding on top of. If anything, just for the purpose of learning 400+ words this game is a invaluable source for language learners in a somewhat beggining state.
