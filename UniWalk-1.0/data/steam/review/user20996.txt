This game has got a lot of features that will get you addicted to it, but the thing that hooked me was the multiplayer. i have enjoyed this game through out all the patches.
GET it it's free and amazing
Once again a free game but this time it is better than TF2
this game has been my long favorite, i have played not much of it, but all my hours are generally in the one session because, this game is very very addictive. When i first got it my mate and I played for about 15 hours over the period of 2 days and i really enjoyed the game so buy it if you wish.
