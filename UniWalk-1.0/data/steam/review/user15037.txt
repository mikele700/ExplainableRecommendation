I sold my PS4 to get this so.Pros *Every faction is new and has cool types of troops*Ai is better *great map*mods fix alot of thingsCons*Ai is stupid when it comes to joining to FIGHT ♥♥♥♥ING CHAOS
I liked this game but it has really bad problems with frame rate and hackers ,(it was this or dayz so yeah i chose this) PROS* The game has a map that is good really fits the demon problem.* you can join clans even tho they can still kill you which is Annoying* safe zones are far so if you want to travel please avoid night.Cons *people camp safezone for some reason , just saying if you do that ,your basically a noob. * most people fire on sight those are new guys*bad pay2win things going on.
its a great game but play with friends or try to talk to the team
look how long i have play it.
GREAT for those who want trech warfare (ME)
*MORE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S ON THIS THAN DAYZ BUT THEY HAVE THEY'RE Reasons*i learnt that chicken meat comes from pigs .*Nakeds are ♥♥♥♥♥.*CLAN WARS ARE AMAZEBALLS.
this game is for all those no hope zombie fans. you pretty much start off in a house or camping site or farm . just like a normal survival game you must gather and loot as much as you can but , if they zombies don't get you the lack of food and water and power will. you can died from colds, choking and manly other things .  you make alot of friends online (i hope). this game is a real game life walking dead tv season.
better than minecraft
