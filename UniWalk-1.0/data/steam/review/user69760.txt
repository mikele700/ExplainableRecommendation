If you play it once you can't stop. 10/10 - Me

Are you bored of boring games with no fun? Do you want a game where you can do anything you want, but with F.R.I.E.N.D.S.? Well GMOD is for you. With tones of workshop add ons, and amazing machinimas, this game is a great MP and SP experience.
Ok. Let me get this straight. This game is incredible from it-'s trading economy to competitive highlanders and even a game mode where you and your team verse a big strong man who goes by the name Saxton Hale. This game has absolutely everything. But don-'t forget it-'s amazing community with it-'s SFM animations and it-'s wacky Garry-'s Mod animations and thousands of pages of Fan Artwork. But did I mention the Hats? Yes, this name could infact go by the name Hat Simulator 2007. People go CRAZY for this special type of quality hat called an -Unusual-. I unboxed my first yesterday and from a $2.49 Key, you get a $40 Hat. That is what strived me to write this rather long review for this Amazing Game. So, in the end, do I recommend it? HELL YES!
I use to hold the world record for the speedrun of this but then the game was updated but idc.
