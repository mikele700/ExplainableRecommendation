7/10 fun game, but I wouldn't reccommend this game (3/10) for SERIOUSLY IDIOTIC checkpoints. Would be MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better with more frequent Checkpoints, or the ability to save in the middle of a game, since players can't continue where they left, we HAVE to restart from the beginning if you quit in the middle of game
