This game is ok I dont think this game will die soon as people leave the game and some join.I like this game more than csgo cause it is kinda more original. So I may be taking  a break from csgo who knows.
meh The game is ok But I think TF2 is just A bit better.
This game has surprised me before I thought it was bad so I didn't get it and now I just tried and I am in love with this game.Suprisingly It nearly reached the level to counter strike global offensive besides the graphics,year and different  game modes.However this game is very casual like Team fortress 2.If you have experience in Csgo and CsSource will be very easy as they ar pretty much the same.However this game might need to improve a bit in the model of how you play.So in my opinion I think this game should be a must have for casual players not sure about competitive.So thumbs up I reccomend this game
pretty fun and balanced
As a gamer (I aint no life) you nend to express your feelings.My game that I love th most has got to be unturned becasue of its community and gameplay.This game has recieved many updates and gets opayed alot of attention to this may not b e teh best game in the world but watch out it might become close to the top.GGWP NELSON WELL PLAYES.Another game I love has got
