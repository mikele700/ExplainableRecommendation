This is a great game even though it is an Early Access game. I played an 8 hour long session yesturday and i had alot of fun in those 8 hours, but there a few things that should be fix and improved.-The first thing is that sometimes when i go out on the yellow raft it will de-spawn, then re-spawn then de-spawn etc..-The second thing is that there are not enough rocks... i feel like that the large rocks on an island should be able to be mined with a pickaxe or someother tool for rocks if you could add that into this game it would make it an even better game.-And my last point is that you should be able to make a bigger inventory -EG- by making a craftable backpack? or being able to find one in reckage, i do not know if there is an item to make a bigger back pack but if there isnt there is an idea for you. Even though this game is still in Early Access its still a great game 9/10 its worth the $15,00 i would buy it again.
