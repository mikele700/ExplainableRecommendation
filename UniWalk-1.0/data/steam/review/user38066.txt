A game that should be been kept as a mod even if it was going to be sold through the makers of arma like the dlc marksman,helis ect a very bad engine and doesnt come close to how good the arma 2 version is.Very buggy wont even keep it on my pc its that bad.Lost my support on this one.
Awesome game love it grabbed all the dlc l enjoyed it that much.
Real poor graphics in the game in the trailor it looks awesome and in game are nothing like what you play l had this reccommended to me and l wouldnt recommend it to anyone really in alpha stage but it is growing on me. abd it is early access atm.First l wanted to get a refund on the game in 10 minutes of buying it at first and as l got into it on a friends server and starting building things its not a bad game.Best played as a co op or group as you can get rolled easy on your own.
