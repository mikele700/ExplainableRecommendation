It is a good game just you will not recieve what you see in the pictures and trailer just yet you will have to wait a bit anyway this game is still a good game, you are able to enjoy the creative part of things while also being able to enjoy the destuctive part of things. I think this game is good for anyone who enjoys building, strategy, and the destructive power of weapons. As i said at the start the game is still in alpha so if you want all the features the pictures and trailer show i say wait and just keep a eye on the game and wait for the update.
