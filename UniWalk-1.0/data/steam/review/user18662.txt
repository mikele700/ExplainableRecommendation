I was hooked on this game; I actually finished this game which is very rare for me. It's hard finding a good game that is based on a movie. These games notoriously tend to be bare minimum games that are just taking advantage of a popular moives and are often described as rushed, boring and lazy. This game was very entertaining and really seemed to take the back to the future law to a new level but still maintains the feel of it being part of the back to the future universe.
This was the first indie game I've ever purchased on steam; I heard so many great things about this game I had to try it out for myself. I was surprised at how polished this game looks and plays. This is an excellent example as to how an indie game should be and there have been many since that have followed this example. I love platformer's that introduce environment altering elements that allow for a huge variety of puzzles rather then it just being another run and jump platformer. The puzzles in this game are so complicated it makes my brain hurt! I admit I became stuck and have not yet gone back to this game to try again.
