This game IS NOT worth it. YOU WILL WASTE A LOT OF MONEY. The amount of DLC in this game is MIND BENDING AND IT COST A LOT TOO. If you have a small loan of a million dollars this game is great for you. The amount of DLC in this game makes it feel like you have to buy it all to enjoy... which sadly is true. After driving your train for ten minutes you insantly board or have had enough of the game and tend to never play it again or just come back to it after a year and do the same thing. There a missions that go for HOURS. The content is boring after playing it all. I also don't understand how this game is enjoyable to others in the way it makes me want to sleep. The content that you start off with is terrable. This game really lacks any enjoyment. In conclusion its very boring and is only good for you if you love trains and want to drive one in real life. I Don't Recommand This Game.
it can offen stuff up downloading and make you redownload it to stop it crashing. yer. this needs fixing!
