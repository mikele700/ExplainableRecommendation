keeps crashing
apart from the FPS cap its been a good game
The program is good and works but requires you to have tonnes of ram and is super buggy at times and crashes
game crashes constantly please fix
great game but it has a few annoying things about it like how you always spawn into the game from the same tower why not let me spawn to where i left off?
