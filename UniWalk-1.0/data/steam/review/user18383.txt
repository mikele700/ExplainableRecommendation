If u play tf2,cs:go whatsoever that includes armor.DON'T PLAY THIS GAME.THIS IS A DYING SIMULATOR,NOT A STAYIN ALIVE SIMULATOR.The reload animation sucks,but why would i say that ?BECAUSE HALF LIFE,OPPOSING FORCE AND BLUE SHIFT HAS A RELOAD ANIMATION ALTHOUGH IS MADE IN THE 90S !!!!! IN COMBAT,U CAN'T EVEN SEE WHERE THE ENEMY IS WHICH IS CRAZY.I KNOW THAT IT IS MADE IN 2001,BUT C'MON,I AIN'T EVEN COMPLAINING ABOUT THE GRAPHICS BECAUSE IT IS MADE IN FUC*ING 2001,BOHEMIA RUINED THE WHOLE GAMEPLAY MECHANICS ! JUST DON'T BUY THIS , 1.5/10WORST GAME OF THE YEAR,EVERY YEAR !
good thing i still keep a windows xp or i won't be playing this masterpiece !
