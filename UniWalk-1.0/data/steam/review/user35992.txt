This game is extremely unique, and considering there is no other game like it, it-'s amazingly well fleshed out. The game consists of 3 classes, the gunner, the pilot, and the engineer. They have 3 fairly obvious and simple jobs, so by yourself it can be boring. I bought the 4-pack and gave it to my friends, and it has provided plenty of fun with all the communication with things like -fire the portside rockets- and -the U.S.S ♥♥♥♥boy is at 270 degrees-.
I'm gonna start this review by saying this. If you are a big Dead or Alive fan like I am and you dont own a console, buy this game. Otherwise, there's no real other reason to buy it. It offers little that the console version didn't, and doesn't even have online play. The game runs well, but as it's a PS3 port (yes PS3, not PS4) i would expect nothing less. It's more DoA, if you need that in your life then get the game, otherwise, buy it on console or don't buy it at all.
