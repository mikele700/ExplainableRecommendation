I used a 4 year old graphic driver, it randomly crashes. Then I upgraded to the latest driver, it got even worse. If you hava a Nivida card, make sure you're prepared to deal with its infamous black screen problem which remains unsolved for 4 years before purphasing it. The current official answer to fix the problem is to 'downgrade your driver'. MAKE SURE TO CHECK THEIR OFFICIAL FORUM TO SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT IT BEFORE GIVING MONEY TO GREEDY UBISOFT!!!
