Where do I start...This game is amazingly immersive, to the point where even without using the oculus I was scared at times.Great balance of survival and exploration, beautiful graphics for an early access.The devs give you ability to report bugs at any point and will almost defiantely fix it straight away!Amazing customer service!Gameplay:You find yourself crashed, after your mothership had a fatal error when flying.You play as a man tasked with the mission of terra-forming planets so humans can someday live there.You now have to survive your time there, build boats, bases, materials, gear and more!I highly reccomend this game! 8.5/10 (For the early build)

Here are my thoughts on Dirty Bomb:Before I get into the positives and negatives I will give a quick overview of the game.Dirty Bomb is a refreshing and very enjoyable FPS game, brining some new ideas to the franchise and putting a spin on Objective based maps and missions.With the addition of loadouts it gives you something to work towards, though sometimes it was difficult.With a variety of characters to pick from and unlock, there's always a play style for you, and with the free rotation the game gives you a chance to experience new characters for free whilst in the rotation.Quick tip: Pay attention to the Dirty Bomb facebook page, they do giveaways often!Positives:Balanced combat and enjoyable gun play.Beautiful art style and great graphics.New ideas brought to the table (Which are well implemented)Great design.The gameplay is fun, with a variety of gamemodes.Negatives:Not all the gamemodes are accessable yet.Some characters have to be fixed on occationProxy's god damned mines.The addition of Micro-Transaction (Because it's expensive)Conclusion:Either way, Dirty bomb is one of my favourite games this year by far, it's making a huge scene for a good reason.The gameplay is enjoyable, great design, balanced combat.What else can you ask for.Oh AAAANNDD It's free!Without debate I would give this game a 8.5/10, there are some things that have room for improvement.
Where do I even start?.Invent4 Entertainment has just done an incredible job with this game, no wait. To call it a game would be dis-respectful, it's art.It's gameplay is beautifuly combined with amazing graphics and sounds.The puzzles are challenging enough to be fun but never too difficult.All around this game is the best.Last of us, get out of here.IG/N
