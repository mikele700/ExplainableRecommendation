Worthy of any RTS awards! Great classic strategic combat with a HD improvement, nicely balanced building and resource management. It may be an older game now, but its just as good as any of the modern 5 star RTS.  Excellent multiplayer and tierd campaigns to play.Just as good if not better then age of empires 3, and still has an active community.This is one of those games that will stay with you like a jeweld golden tooth, and you tell the developers put their blood swet and tears into this game to make it what it has become.
BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!
