capped to 30 fps, cant rebind keys, all key prompts on menus are for xbox controllers and not mouse and keyboard, no support for keyboard and mouse at all. also, it requires windows live. i regret getting this game, i spent ages with windows live account creation because of how stupid the system was at the time (unsure how it is now) when i finnaly got in it was unplayable. i payed $70 for this when it was new, i wouldnt even spend $4 on it knowing what i know now.
Quack. that is all.
get it. its worth $20 and is an amazing co op game. right now its $3 on steam. GET IT NOW! and get the first one aswell ITS LESS THEN A DOLLAR!
