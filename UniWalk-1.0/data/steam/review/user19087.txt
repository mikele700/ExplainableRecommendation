Its a nice zombie appocolypse game although it doesnt give much help to new players. unlike most zombie games have very easy to kill zombie it is somewhat the case here but not as much you actully have to find your weapons and conserve ammo. unlike other games where ammo seems like something only minor. the maps are good survival and missions which can change sometimes. all around i really like this game, oh did i mention its free?
