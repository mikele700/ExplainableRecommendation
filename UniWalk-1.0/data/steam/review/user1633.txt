Easily one of the most (if not THE most) fun open world games there is. the grapple hook + parachute movement system is so incredibly enjoyable to the point that once you've played just cause 2 for a while you will miss this level of free movement when playing other games. The game play is brilliant; everything in the game is designed for the simple purpose of fun. Hell, even the visuals are brilliant; the game is vibrant, colourful and bright. A solid 8.5/10, fun as hell, though does lack in places like story and voice acting.
Hotline Miami is one of those games that's just damn near perfect.It doesn't look like much from the screen shots and videos, but playing it is a whole different story. The atmosphere is perfect, the gameplay is fast and exhilarating, the visuals suit the game better than you would think and the soundtrack is a masterpiece of its own.The whole game just plays so well and everything fits together. I'd highly recommend it. In fact Hotline Miami is my personal favourite indie game of the year, if not all time.PLAY IT!
Easily the most fun online of any game ive ever played, with campaign mode being either as casual as you want, or an extreme challenge. and versus mode adding a complete new level to the game that's far more fun than any other geneic FPS out there.
