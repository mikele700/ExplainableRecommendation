Call of Duty Black ops - Mac Edition was a very fun, and exilerating game. You unlocked many weopons each time you ranked up, and had many weopon upgrades and costomizable features. Many weopons were only used in certain maps, for example, a l968 sniper rifle (I think thats the name) wasnt used on Nuketown because it would get owned by famas and galils all the time. This game needs some serios addons however, as it became boring at higher ranks. I think the upgrades that should be added are:1.voice comunication2.Larger maps3.more weopons & equipment4.rides such as tanks-jeeps-bikes5.more camos (the only good one is tiger)I hope you guys enjoyed this quick review on Black ops - mac edition.GOLDIE OUT!
