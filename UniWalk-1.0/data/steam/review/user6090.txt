FABULOUS
would I recomend it no I would make you buy it.
This game is great with so much packed into it and its different every time there is only one thing that i dont like is the money system (probably because i suck) but every time you start another lvl you lose all of your money and i think there could have been a better system also when you buy things every thing costs more so you cant just buy small things
This game is a popular clasic frist person shooter and its great and free why not getit.
