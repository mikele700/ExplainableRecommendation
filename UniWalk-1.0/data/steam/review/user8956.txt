Since August 13 (2013) to Dicember (2014) was an amazing coop game, my favourite. I LOVED playing with my friends and with the new ones that i made in the game. I really enjoyed each hour that i spent in this game stealing banks, crafting drugs or when your NOOB friend ♥♥♥♥s everything in a stealth mission. In that time there were only 4 or 5 DCL. I admit, my friends and I used THE DCL UNLOCKER (This hack ONLY UNLOCKS THOSE ♥♥♥♥ING DCL) and we were not kicked or banned (dollar is REALLY EXPENSIVE  in Argentina, i am not gonna pay more than 70 pesos for 1 DCL which include some virtual weapons or a map). Since Dicember (2014) to Nowadays there are 30 DCL. OVERKILL only thinks in money. People stop playing the game, no one buy the game because of all the negatives review. 90% of the negatives reviews complains of all the DCL. And of course there are the small comunity fan that defends the game and buy every ♥♥♥♥ing DLC that this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s makes.Oh, and about the DCL UNLOCKER, it can't be used anymore. if you use it you get kicked of every time that you join a heistSUMMARY: 2013 - 2014 BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED 2015 - NOWADAYS IT'S A SIMULATOR WHICH OBJETIVE IS BUY A DCL THAT YOU CAN!
Por la culpa de un supuesto error del VAC no me dejo unirme al competitivo, me comi van por la culpa del mogolico de steam, Gabe tiene diabetes y es down como alcia. Poronconcha de Gabe. tatata de Gabe. Fournier de Gabe. Cancer de Gabe. Down de steam
El juego esta no me entretuvo ni una hora. no lo recomiendo. no vale la pena pagar 15 USD por esto. les recomiendo que se compren el counter-strike: global offensive que vale lo mismo y es mucho mejor. A demas solo hay alrededor de 3.000 personas que juegan este juego, en CS:GO hay 400.000 personas diarias que juegan
