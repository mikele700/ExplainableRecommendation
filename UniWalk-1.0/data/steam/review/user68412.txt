I was experiencing a little lag here and there in gameplay so I checked for an update, sure enough there was I had just played my previous save and also started again in hard mode it seems everything i open to find loot is invisible even that which i need in the first quest but it is there... Also the person I need to make and supply with a medical pack is invisible along with everyone else apart from 'The Boss' wo gave me the first mission... I almost forgot to say, when I left the tower there was alot of glitched objects and invisible floors and doors.I recommend this game but.. Please Update this!!!
