Lots of fun, although it is early access and lots of things need to be fixed... an example is if you aggro a wolf and dont have the health or weapons to kill it, it will chase you across the whole map unless you manage to get in a house and close all the doors before it can get in. same thing goes for the zombies that can runI wouldnt trust any players that you dont know irl either, even if they are nice to you and say they will -help you-, you will probably get stabbed in the back sooner or laterStay away from cranbery, that town is full of bandits
This game never gets old, just so much to do and much fun to be had :)
Really fun, lots of killing and ♥♥♥♥, but after a while can get very repetitive
