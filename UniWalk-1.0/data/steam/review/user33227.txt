bastion is one hell of a game. I didnt know what to expect of this game but man am i happy i got it. the story is so interesting having this man telling you what has happend but only parts of it. Then you do certain things then he tells you more but the question that keeps you playing what is the calamity?i would recommend this game to any gamer who is looking for a interesting story
awsome game bit lagy but still awsome
