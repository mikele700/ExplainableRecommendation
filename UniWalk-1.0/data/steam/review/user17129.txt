10/10 this is my first and favorite Steam game.The world is huge and fun to explore, with a myriad of content; I've always been discovering new things.It's challenging, but not to the point of frustration. The new expert mode has made it even more fun.And the vagueness of the plot allows you to truly insert yourself as the main character, and even make up your own lore as you go along.This game has always brought out the inner fantasy fan within me, and with the newest update it brought out the inner achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ as well.I would recommend this game to anyone.
When fighting Mom's Heart, I expected U.N. Owen Was Her to start playing.10/10, would cry again.
10/10 The most fun I've ever had crying.
