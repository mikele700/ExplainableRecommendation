VERY ADDICTIVE! Great game, very interesting, doesnt get boring. Great game to kill some time
Love this game, although it makes me wonder if anyones actually ever finished it. Would recommend this game. Kinda reminds me of flappy bird, as I am constantly trying to beat my past personal best. Good game to play without internet connection as there are few updates. Would definitely recommend this game.
As a F2P it could be a lot better. Very limited access for no money, and for full access, costs an arm and a leg. Would not recommend this game to anyone.
