Hat Simulator 2015. 10/10 would spend over 500$ for items again
so broken, cant even play in fullscreen without it twitching, leaving it unplayable or 25-30 fps in windowed. 2/10 >:(
finished a night with no stuff to make a fire. Used friend as ghost to produce light. 10/10 survived night without needing a fire

really fun game! it took me a while 2 get until it went onto this deal so now i can continue the story. And the multiplayer looks very promising but im only gonna play mp after sp but all in all im gonna give it 8.5 only because the campaign is only 5 hours long
its like castle crashers but in 3D!!!!
my pc says i can run this game really well (canyourunit passed over reccomended) and its laggy as f*ck even on lowest settings >:( please optimize soon because i paid good money for this....
Dont buy. Barbarian update broke the game for me. It freezes every now and then and sometimes black screens
sonic 06 loads faster. Still a fun game though so 9/10
Its A very fun shooter with friends. but if not with friends. A tad bit too hard. but anyways 10/10!!! :)
