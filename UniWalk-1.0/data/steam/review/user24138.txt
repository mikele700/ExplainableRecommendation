Really amazing game so far, but I am having some frame rate issues in the areas with wide-angle environment shots (the forest, for example). Even though my specs are above the mininum required, even when I disable effects the fps drops significantly in these areas and frankly, it's a bummer. However the gameplay is engaging enough that I can ignore the crappy frame-rate for the most part, and the characters are really interesting so far. I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys visual novels or choose-your-own-adventure type games.
It's like someone threw everything you love about Harvest Moon, Terraria, and Animal Crossing together in a pot, and cooked it up with awesome pixel art, an adorable soundtrack, and super lovable characters. One of my favorite games of all time.
