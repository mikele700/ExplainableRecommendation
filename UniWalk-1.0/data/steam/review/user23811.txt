Pros:*Great monster.*Fun to play.*Plays very uniquely.*Looks really badass.Cons:*Terrible against the dlc hunters, specifically Torvald (the dlc assault).*It's rediculously overpriced.*There are very few skins for him (none are directly in the steam store, you need to open the game and goto the shop in the main menu).*None of said behemoth skins come in bundles with the other monsters.If you really want to buy this dlc, go ahead. Behemoth is a very fun too play monster and I enjoy playing him very much. The only real downside too him is the price, he should really only cost $5.00 (considering that steam charges usd, behemoth is even more expensive for us Australians).
Now that Minimum is back up, I've decided to change my review.Minimum is a pretty awesome game, with fun gameplay and a creative array of weaponry.Pro's:*Nice map and entity design.*Creative weapons and armour, yes I know I'm repeating myself.*Option to play as a male or female, which I know some people find important.*Titan mode is fun to play and the Titans are pretty awe inspiring when they clash.*Only real learning curve is learning how to counter melee. (Don't listen to those who complain melee is too overpowered, it is very easy to counter with the right weaponry and with enough practice)Con's:*The inventory whipe kind of killed it for me, I had spent a long time obtaining my items and while they said that they made all cosmetics/items craftable, some of my favourites are actually not craftable, such as the harvest sickles and the pumpkin grenades.*Australian's may have a hard time playing as the player hosted servers can get quite lag, but its usually not unbearable.*Last I checked the co-op survival mode, I believe it was called Horde mode or something, was currently not working, which sucks because it used to be very fun.While the cons I've listed may seem to outweigh the pro's, this is really not the case. Minimum is a very fun game and I can't wait till it's completely restored to its former glory :)Minimum was one of my favourite games.However I would not recommend buying it (not that you can) in it's current state due to:#1 (This is the most important issue) The servers have been down for what seems like an eternity, you cannot actually play the game should you buy it![/b]#2 Prior to the server issues the new developers did not release that much new content. They redid some maps and released a couple new maps, but didn't add any new weapons or armour. (Not that the old developer were any better, as prior to the new developers taking ownership of the game they had not released anything new for quite some time). The last content update I remember was an april fools joke! When they added an invisible weapon and armour (the promo for said armour looked awesome, shame they didn't just make that armour)#3 Prior to the server issues the community was very small. Quite often you'd end up being put on a server with bots rather than one of the few servers with people on them. This was not always the case, as the community used to be huge before the old devs stopped making new content.Minimum was an amazing game and should they fix all the problems and actually bring the servers back online and start releasing new content (it would be a lot easier if they just hosted directly through steam like some other games) then go ahead and buy it, you won't regret it. But sadly it doesn't look like that time is coming any time soon :( Thankyou for reading my review!
Warhammer 40k Eternal Crusade looks very promising, but it is important to note that in its current state it is more of a combat demo.The final game will be a open world mmo shooter while in its current state its a pvp session shooter (session shooters are games like TF2 and Rainbow 6 Siege)
Fans of the supreme commander games will enjoy this.Just be warned, the Ai is ridiculous and it's hard to know what to do early on as there is no proper tutorial.In my first match I was on a completely different planet to the Ai, going about my business, then 10 minutes into the game the Ai came in with 10 orbital weapons and all its hyper-advanced tanks and absolutely wiped my puny army of 50 tanks off the map.It's much harder to get the hang of than the supreme commander games. But from what I've heard its so much fun once you've got the hang of it.Be warned!There is only a small number of free commanders (basically ACU's from Supreme Commander and Supreme Commander 2) and it can be tempting to buy some of the cool looking $10 (USD, so it's even more than $10 for us Australian players D; ) commanders.
Brilliant little gem of a game.Pro's:*Great gameplay*Very little lag*Great dialogue*Interesting loadout system*Fun mapsCon's:*Grindy*Not enough cons.A guy I met in Warframe got me to try this and now it is one of my favourite games.
First things first, THIS IS NOT A NEGATIVE REVIEW.I just wanted to point out a few things you should consider before buying this pack:Thought the commanders in this looked cool, then I saw all the other purchaseable ones in-game and felt ripped off.It's like they took the least cool looking kickstarter ones and put them in this one pack.The commanders themselves are pretty good in game, however Xenosentry seems to have more hp than the Gambitdfa.I don't know whats going on there.Overall if you enjoy this game and want to buy these three go ahead, they're pretty awesome. However I'd recommend buying some of the other commanders instead.
Pros:- Make your own guns/skins/maps- Download and use custom guns/skins/maps made by other players- Nice steam emoticons.Cons:- No way of making good ironsights without a picture editing program capeable of giving your image a transparent           background.- ^because of this its hard to make guns that you'll actually be able to use (as player voting system will prvent it from getting through)- Barely anyone plays it anymore.Great game, but due to its multiplayer focus, it is basically unplayeable now as no-one plays it anymore.Spend your money elsewhere.
This is the first soundtrack I-'ve actually purchased, not including things like the grey goo soundtrack which came with an expansion, so while I may not be able to compare it to other soundtracks I still felt that I should give it a good review.ProsComes with some nice ingame content (the warthog skin is one of my new favourite skins).Great Music.It-'s not too pricey.If you really want to you can sell the ingame content you get for quite a nice amount of diamonds.ConsIf you-'re not big on music the only thing you really get out of this is the ingame content.It does not explain how to access your new songs, I was expecting them to be added to the music section of my steam library when it turns out I had to actually go into Airmechs files to find them.If you-'re not a fan of -electronic- music than again all you-'ll really get out of buying this is the ingame content.
This is a really fun mmo, I've been playing it for a quite while now (before it had released on steam).It's especially fun if you have some friends to play it with. Even after you have unlocked every class there is still plenty to do and earn, such as wings, dragons, mounts, allies and much, much more!Be warned however, ever since the steam release trading can be particularly nasty.Finding specific items and their value can be hard sometimes and with the steam launch a large of mount of... well lets just say not very nice people started playing the game. A small part of the friendly community from post-steam launch is still there and a lot of friendly people joined after the steam launch, you just have to be wary of people trying to rip you off or make life hard for you. Those people are still a minority however and it's easy to play the game without ever meeting one of them.Trion worlds have really outdone themselves with Trove and I can't wait for the new class, The Lunar Lancer, to be released. (a long time ago I bought a pack for the game and after i finished getting all classes they added a non tardeable class coin to the stuff in the pack, and then gave everyone a free one, so yeah i really need some new classes to release to spend them on lol)
