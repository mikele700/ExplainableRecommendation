It is one of the best F2P FPS shooters on the market, with a great cartoon-like art style and lots of hats  so if you are tired of FPS without sytle, TF2 is a great game for you.just DO NOT log on a trade server, and trade with someoneEver It WILL ruin your life.
Well worth your 9.99, this just a game were you mess around Not much else, reallyUnless if you join some multiplayer servers, but this game is perfectly fine in single play mode
I have mixed feelings about thisThis game is a one of the finest games I've played in some time but...This is a certain p2p benefits game, but I played a bit and I didn't any many problems with pay walling in it. There is some grinding to after around 20 hours into the game howeverGraphics are great considering that it's f2p.Story is wonderful.So about 8/10 from meThere is no harm in trying LOTR0
A hard game even on easy mode, this game is a hard nut to crack, there is no respawning so you will rage at that. This game is going to murder your ability to have patcience, but in the end this game is a little gem, with plenty a ragequits and -why the hell did I do that moments-.The graphics are very good and fit sound great and most important,  great gameplay is as great as a rebel fighting game thing priate thing8--10
To laggy 15 fps at maxBoring gameplay(In my opinion)
