Don-'t mistake this game for an FPS, some people enter into this game expecting COD ...it-'s not. ARMA is a full battlefield simulator which it does well at. In ARMA you-'re not meant to feel invincible, if you don-'t take cover you-'ll die, if you don-'t communicate with your squad you-'ll die. It has an insane learning curve that will take most people a long time to get used to, but only makes it very satisfying once you finally figure out how to fly or use artillery or...anything. The complicated controls at first can seem annoying but once you-'re used to them you-'ll be grateful you can stick your head up just enough to see an enemy out of a window without exposing your whole body.The games mod-ability makes it possible to play an infinite array of game modes making it difficult to get truly boring. While there is a battlefield like mod called king of the hill the size of the maps alone makes the game vastly more complex and that-'s saying nothing of the array of vehicles that can completely alter the game from just one player knowing how to fly or range a sniper rifle. Unfortunately the ARMA engine is well known for how glitchy it can get, Most of this has been ironed out and the presence of hackers ruining servers has been greatly reduced since early access. At times clipping through a wall or falling through the floor of a building still happens but it-'s not so common that it ruins things.At the end of the day the game requires being patient and on your toes while communicating what you see with teammates. The different mods and game modes give the game infinite potential but the glitches can create issues sometimes. ARMA 3 is a military sim not -insert FPS here- don-'t get attached to scores and if you find yourself complaining over global that someone using a plane is -cheap- or a -noob-  close the game and reevaluate who you want to be in life.
