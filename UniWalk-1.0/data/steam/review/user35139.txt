I've only played 30 hours of this, and quite frankly... it is spectacular. It does require some hefty hardware to play the game maxed out (as anyone would expect from a game with a great physics engine), but you will enjoy it. I wrote this review just after the exploration release, and it has advanced space engineers alot faster than any other games in terms of development in an alpha stage (thanks to the great developers). They truly connect with the community, and the modding side is easy to use. The UI can be a bit tough to use at first, but after a while you will get used to it. This is my dream game and I look forward to seeing it progress, and so far, it has done a great job in fulfilling my dream.
