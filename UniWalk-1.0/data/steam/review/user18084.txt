Farming, crafting, cooperation, clans, alliances, ninjas, SPACE NINJAS, NINJAS WITH GUNS, PARKOUR, MELEE, LAZER GUNS THAT GO WWWWWWWOOOOOOOOZZZZZHHHHHHHHH, TENTACLE SPACE WATER NINJA WITH A PIRATE THEMED LOOKS AND WATER POWERS! AND LOTS MOAR! I've been playing this game for a while and I still think I've barely scratched the surface that this game offers.DE is extremely supportive of this game and OMG this game has changed so so much. This game is in no way a pay-to-win game. Yes it has microtransactions but you can obtain every damn thing in this game besides cosmetics, although during special events DE gives them out for 'free'. But seriously play this game. It's really good.LIKE REALLY, REALLY GOOD.
FUN~
