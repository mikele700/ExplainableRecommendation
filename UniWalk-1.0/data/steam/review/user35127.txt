This game is full of derankers, hackers, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, trolls and griefers so theres literally no point in playing if you cant get out of silver becasue of these ♥♥♥♥ers
The game is just plain boring and slow but then to easy to deafet monsters crafting is alright but not very rewardinggraphics and animations are absolute ♥♥♥♥  for competative gamers don`t even download it for casuals its okay in generaloveral 2/10 game --do not recomend it
it`s a terible 3rd person shooter where you rent or can only use for a certain amount of time and the maps are tiny
AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
