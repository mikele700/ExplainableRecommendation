Assasin's Creed IV Black Flag is the best game of the Assasin's Creed series. It has a good plot line. Much lesser glitches than Assasin's Creed 3. Much BETTER naval combat than Assasin's Creed 3. Better multiplayer and combat. The environment is also much more realistic than Assasin's Creed 3. The 59.99 dollars I had to spend, It was all worth it!
