Lovely game, can build and break friendships, if you like arguing over who was supposed to get what pager and whose fault it is that you failed stealth then this is your game. Game is almost pointless without DLC, so even though it costs a lot, I recommend having all of the DLC, or at least majority of it for the full experience.The game has become a lot easier the longer it has been out for, so it's pretty noob friendsly by now. And the amount of free weekends and sales on there's no reason not to have it in your library.
