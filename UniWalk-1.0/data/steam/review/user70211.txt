Best free FPS game of all time. 'Nuff said.
A great MMORPG with undoubtedly the best community I have ever seen in all of the games I've played. Joining a good guild is a must if you ever decide to play this game. The heavy amount of grinding, combined with my lag, makes this game very repetitive and frustrating in the later stages of the game, but the rewards are well worth it.Spiral Knights is one of the first games, alongside TF2, that I've played ever since I started gaming 9 years ago. Overall, it's an awesome game with nice graphics, gameplay and mechanics - something that's definitely worth trying out.
A decent game. Would be better if there was more people actually playing.
Undoubtedly the best RPG game I have ever played. The open world aspect of the game allows you to delay the main quests indefinitely and explore the massive world that Skyrim has to offer. The game is however, prone to crashes, and contains a huge number of bugs and glitches - some of which will leave you ripping your teeth out while others will leave you with stomach pains from the utter hilarity of the whole situation.Overall, Skyrim is a great game with amazing graphics, plot and decent gameplay mechanics. Definitely worth trying it out.
Nice 2.5D sidescroller RPG with decent plot and gameplay.
A very decent turn-based war strategy game considering the size of the development team.
