This isn't your average fighting game.Toribash is about pulling off awesome moves to defeat manequin-like people, if it was that easy. It is extremely complicated and takes a while to get used to. So unless you are willing to invest a large amount of your time in this I would leave it alone.Starting to play this game I would start clicking on random body parts trying to kick the other guy in the face and eventually fall over onto the floor and flop around trying to get back up until I get disqualified because something other than my limbs brushed the floor like I was playing 'the floor is lava'. After I got the hang of it (to a degree) I started to pull of some cool moves and I did have a bit of fun with it. Even if I still kept falling over onto the floor.I also tried it out with my friends, which I have to say was a lot of fun. Most of the games ended up with us both on the floor swinging random body parts around in an attempt to hit eachother while trying not to get disqualified until it ended up like the least interesting game of twister ever. But in the end we had a good laugh.There are also a lot of mods (and I mean a lot) for this game, that can change it completely and make the game a bit more interesting. I won't go too much in detail about that though as there are too many mods to write a review on.This game is definately worth picking up especially for the fact that is free, it's definately a unique experience for the fighting genre and it equals for a good laugh with friends.8/10 :)
Don't get this. The end.
