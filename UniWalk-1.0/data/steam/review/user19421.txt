This Game is aimed at kids obviously, has a mario or one of those old ps1 games styles to it, i wouldn't recommend it but it's an okay game!Pros Soundtrack is pretty cool Get to collect the tears of fairies and berriesGet to smash the crap out of people trying to hurt you or innnocent caterpillarsCons Terrible handling of  controls Graphics are worse than Half LifeStoryline is none exsistant and is just plain crapThe animals 1 hit you then you restart, no checkpoints for each level which is absolute annoying and bs Overall The game is just dumb and should not even be on steam. Oh Even though a friend gave this to me for free i would not play it again 
Game consists of these peopleList Of People- Russians- Smurfs- Silvers- Trolls and Fake Bots- Derankers- Pros- Global Elites- 12VIESSS- Funny asf people- CS:GO STRIKE RUSSIAN OFFENSIVE
This is my review for Hitman Absolution.Throughout my 42 hours of gameplay i have seen the pros and cons of this game and the interesting parts of how you can choose your path and score points and other certain things that help you along the way.So here are my - Pros - and  - Cons -PRØS:- Amazing graphics and surrondings- Cutscenes are reasonably interesting - Get to choose what way you want to take down or kill your target- If the level is hard you can use the instinct button to help you- Campaign makes you keep playing because it is so fun, maybe for some that is- Contracts mode is very fun and challenging CØNS:- Can get very frustrating for some at times- The checkpoint system is very annoying when in difficult spots, and having to restart over and over again- For MAC players i have heard that contracts mode can not be played- Not really a stealthy game Anyways thanks for reading my review.  :)
