Worth the price regardless of sales. 10 years old but the anniversary edition polished a game that was still replayable 10 years later.Still the best of the -diablo-like- games I have ever played.Buy the game.
This is tied for the best CoD game with Modern Warfare 2. MW2 has better MP progression with more ways to gain experience and more weapon options, but this game is tied for first because it has dedicated servers. Good old CoD without the gimmicks or the constant new money sinks.
This is still the pinnacle of the Call of Duty series, let down only by matchmaking. I would sacrifice many fat goats to the mighty Gaben if the Australian community would thrive again.Buy this game and play it instead of any of the new yearly money pits.
Used to have a proper positive review and recent updates have really sent the game up ♥♥♥♥ creek.New XP system has divided the community and waves of people are quitting as the game is pretty much geared towards no lifers now. Don't bother buying if you have a job or go to school. The grind before it becomes fun is too real.
