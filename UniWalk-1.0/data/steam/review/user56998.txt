Playing this was fun, i played this without the knowledge that it is actualy an RPG, therefore it if fun whilst playing with many members ranging 2-4 (including yourself) well i only reccomend 4 as you can only fir 4 people in one group but you can fir upto i believ 60 into a clan, this game is basically like any traditional MMo RPG but this is a bit more realistic and modern as it uses Cars, Guns Cops, Drugs and yea. if you ask me it is fun to play, play it if you have some spare money cause most MMO RPG's are pay to win, and this is certainly one of them! but it doesnt change the fact you can do alot for free as there are random events that give you redemption codes for premium member ship and more other cool gifts!
