A very enjoyable game. it is a good timewaster and quite addicting. The puzzle pieces are different types of shapes every new puzzle making it different and sometimes harder for the puzzels.I would rate it 7/10 only because it doesnt have many puzzels for you to complete so they need to upgrade it a bit!
