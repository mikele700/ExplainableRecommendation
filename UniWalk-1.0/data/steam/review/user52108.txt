Maybe if I don't finish this review I'll match the qua
Very enjoyable for an Early Access game, It shows so much potential, It's fresh exciting and has one of the coolest atmospheres I've seen in a long time.
Glad it's officially back up on Steam, this is just one of those games that shouldn't be enjoyable, but just is. <3
Tears have been shed, worth a little playthrough :')
This > COD: Ghosts
Isn't exactly innovative but a fun campaign and great co-op-Multiplayer is dead.
Hours of fun online and off
Flaws in this game shouldn't matter to anyone, it's free, it's fun, it pulls you in and it's atmospheric.Ticks all boxes for me.
