space engineers is great game i highly recomend it. i got and loved it. i give it an 8/10 but that could change to a higher score very soon because its still early access. Get it now before its price rises because it becomes more awsome.

the trailers for this game made it look like a good one but from what i have played, the trailer looks like it's worth more than the game itself.~PROS~nothing here(so sad)~CONS~overpowered weaponsconfusing menuout dated engine(nothing wrong with source it's just old)no australian servers(as an australian gamer this cause MAJOR lag issues)bad controlsnot tactical in any way~final thought~we got nothing that made this game look good, all we got was a sad piece of C**P that no one wants to play. If you want a tactical game buy counter strike global offensive, if you want a free to play game that is amazing get team fortress 2. This game is like counterstrike and call of duty had a baby. and it was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Oh and it's just a waste of space on your hardrive
