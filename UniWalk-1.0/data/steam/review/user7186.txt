Zombies. I bought this game because of zombies and they took that and ♥♥♥♥ on it, while holding me down and forcing me to look at it, I cried, cried so much. After they finished letting the whole company of Treyarch ♥♥♥♥ on it, they then shoved my face into it, I am afraid some of the ♥♥♥♥ has entered me, killing me slowly. Now I sit here dying with Call of Duty Black Ops 3 shadowing all of my past mistakes. Hopefully at my funeral this will be a message for all of the children to stay away from the cancer that is, the new parts of Call of Duty franchise.
Doesn't play Space Jam theme song in new hoops update. 0/10
