One of the best telltale games ever
Rust was not at all promising at the start as it was still in Alpha most of the server's were filled to the brim with hackers but now Rust is a completely new game as it  focuses it more on survival as most items are crucial to you surviving when i first starting playing the new rust it became more realistic as you needed clothes for warmth and if you were to swim  naked you would come out freezing as would normaly. One of the biggest changes to Rust was the rad zones before on the old Rust rad zones were always the most heated zones as they were always being contested now there are simply no rad zones there are barrels which are spread out throughout the map and there is always the occasional air drop every know and again there also made guns more rare which i love because starting as a fresh spawn in the old Rust and trying to get resources i often found myself dying over and over again to people in full kev but now i just mostly see naked men with bows running around. All i have to say is that the new Rust is what a wanted from the old Rust as it improves all the features from the old and makes its a loveable game again.
This game is  so fun with friends learning how to play can be so simply this game is evenly matched to league of legends their pretty much the same concept level up your hero and destroy the main heart of the base expect all heroes are unlocked on dota 2 but in lol you have to pay to buy new heroes and skins something that might make people go crazy but i think dota 2 should be as much the same popular aspects and i just love it when i get a high kill streak making me feel like a god and winning matches with friend i recommed this game for steam users and enjoy! 9/10
This game has great potenial the campaign is quite good  online invasion with friends it fun but some of the weapons are simply hard to use some weapons just feel's the same your secondary does no damage whats so ever even to kill a robot on low health  you cannot do. Even though this game was released in 2013 i expected more from sega i rather play jak and daxter on the ps2 i still have more fun buy this game for lols or just with friends. 3/10
This game is so fun with friends as you run around with a lightsaber in your hand and the force in yourself.
