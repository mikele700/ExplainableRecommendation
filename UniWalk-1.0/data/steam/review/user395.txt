Very great game, original concept and definitely worth the money
Took me 70 hours to finish the story, that says something about this game. The DLC's add a lot more gameplay, plus the free DLC. Theres somuch gameplay to it, so many challenges and sidequests. Truly a full game
This game is literally BL2 in space with lasers and different action skills (With the exception of Clap-Trap), Its very good, would recommend to anyone who likes BL2
This game is amazing, the graphics, the story, the concept, the environment, it's just beautiful. I rate it 9/10
This game does't have half life 3, therefore it sucks. 0/10 would internet conspiracy again
