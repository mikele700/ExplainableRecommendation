Well I bought this game at 3 in the morning and probobly wasn't thinking straight... well I can tell you... this was a great!!! one of the best split second decisions of my life, this game is hilarious. 9/10 because im all alone and can't play it with anyone.. :(*EDIT*Okay so ive had this game for a good 2 years now, playing it on and off and such, it's had some... ordinary updates but all together stayed a pretty good game, if anything i'd say its certainly improved! I still recommend this game but I also maybe recommend waiting for it to go on sale.
well um... i don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ im playing here... its certanly interesting and boring at the same time... uhhh. yeah... 4/10 not enough love triangles
Hit a hobo with a shovel 10/10
I downloaded the lite version because im cheap and it was better and easier than I expected 9/10 only because I wish I had more background music :3
