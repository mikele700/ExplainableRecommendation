I got this game just after it was released, and when I was playing then it was fun, but was lacking substance. What I mean is, I kept hitting brick wall, after brick wall really early on, and spent a lot of time waiting, this was around when the developers said they were up to 10% of the games potential. I stopped playing for ages, and just started a couple of days ago again, (now up to 51%) and it is SO much better now. There has been a lot of really well thought out updates to prevent waiting around, as well as cleaning up, and adding another race. I am also glad I had to restart so I could learn all the new things. I am still early on, so unsure if this is already in the game, but I would really like to see something like a warrior type person, or someone that could fight the champions on voyages or scare of the party people. Overall though, this game has improved A LOT, and is well worth playing, its enjoyable, and its great to just let things sit while you go out, and come back and see all the progress!AS it is at the moment, I would still rate this an 8/10, it will definitely become a 10/10 game as soon as everything is complete.Keep up the good work guys!P.S. The developer commentary is very helpful as well as very natural sounding.
This game has a lot of potential, and is extremely fun to explore and try and survive. One thing I would really enjoy though, is perhaps some caves which larger predators can not fit into, and not sure if this is already in there as I havent clocked up many minutes/hours. But the ability to climb trees, or a tree house in which to shoot from would be amazing! any way 9/10 at the moment, can not wait to see what gets added and how it turns out in the end. Awesome job guys!!
