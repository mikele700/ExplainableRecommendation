Me being a hardcore pacifist, I really enjoyed this game!
Unturned, more like turned off my computer and threw it out the window.
First time setup takes too long to load. if you are immortal or simply have a few years to waste then i do recommend this game. customization in this game is amazing, but gameplay is simply horrible.
