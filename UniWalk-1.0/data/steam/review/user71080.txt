Nice classic game that reminds old Galaxy games. Addictive and one-more-level style. Graphic is simple but it's not so tiring as many other flashing space game that makes eyes sore.
Great platform game! Control is very easy and intuitive. It's so intuitive that it should be loved by children also. Graphic is simple but funny and has some style that I think is best for cartoon-styled games.
It's a great and addictive game. It's much better than it seems after looking at screenshots or reading description. It's higly playable and fun.
