NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM Revolution smashed my expectations considering that there wasn't going to continue with the main story line. The game is beautiful and you should get it
Got killed by a wild flock of Dodo's 11/10 would hunt for meat again,
Very good RPG if your a RPG fan you will like this
