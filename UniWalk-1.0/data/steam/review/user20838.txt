This game is the true RPG, the choices you make reflect your true nature and ignorance. The choices you have to make really mess with your consience. It has a very depressing story with dark humour added to it. To me this game is a masterpiece of an RPG.8/8
This really was a great experience
Tip: When driving Tanks don't use the mouse to look around, use the numpad to look around, or you will lose movement guage things for staying still
