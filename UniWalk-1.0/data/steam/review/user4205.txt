The gameplay is quite good and worthy of a thumbs up. Ubisoft ruins the experience. Constant never experienced before connection problems, gamebreaking crashes to desktop that happen often enough to feel like they-'re happening all the time - the fact that if your game crashes or you lose connection from a ranked game and the game ends while you-'re trying to turn the game back on and reconnect, you get temporarily banned from ranked games for -abandoning-.  More time is spent in matchmaking than in game in r6 siege.This game is largely unfinished and like many other unfinished games, has been labelled as a finished one. I can accept that ranked play is in Beta and should be reviewed as such, but the entire game as a whole is a bit broken and as a whole, should have a rating below its current.EDIT - I have been randomly kicked off of ranked matches and temporarily banned 3 times now, I-'m actually losing ranks because of this game-'s flawed -'toxic community-' paranoia. If you-'re going to temporarily ban people for prematurely leaving games, perhaps exclude those who have been thrown off games by unstable connection to unstable servers from being banned.
