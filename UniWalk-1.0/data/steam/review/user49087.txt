Join a server and get yelled at by a bunch of 9 - 12 year olds. Accidentaly made the mistake of calling a 9 year old 12 and got my ear drums pierced. Other than that it offers hours of some fun gameplay and moments of stupid fun. if you play DarkRP make sure to read the rules other wise people will whine and call an admin
Originally bought this for the 360 then got stuck so i returned it. Bought it on PC for some nostalgia then realised  how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it was
Got a friend to lead a kid to a police station so we could hold him for ransom. Turns out he had no friends so we had to kill him. I also got hit by zombies through a wall. 10/10 would wear green clothes as camo
Joined when keys were worth 2.33 - 2.55 ref. 4 years later there worth 19 - 20 ref. 10/10 would be better off buying the keys for $2.49.
My reveiw for -Heros & Generals on Ice- The movement in-game feels like the character is on ice. Even though the game was patched to change it it still feels like my character slides and floats after i jump. Feels too much like a pay to win. 10/10 would slide
Get asked to pass the whiskey too often. This game is full of alcoholics in that are trying to get me to become one of them.  Besides the some how functioning alcoholics asking for me to contribute to their habit the game offers some good western style gameplay.
Made the mistake of killing a 12 year old 6 consecutive times and said i was hacking (i wasn't) 2 minutes later... LT.tallywhacker 21 Feb, 2014 @ 6:09pm  i will ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ on your face you ♥♥♥♥ing hacker i will come to you house and ♥♥♥♥ing murder you mother ♥♥♥♥ing prick LT.tallywhacker 21 Feb, 2014 @ 6:04pm  your a ♥♥♥♥mother ♥♥♥♥er Other than the abuse from minors it offers a good alternitive from most fast paced fps' and offers multiple hours hours of solid gameplay. The only eSport im relatively good at. eSports is still a sport.
