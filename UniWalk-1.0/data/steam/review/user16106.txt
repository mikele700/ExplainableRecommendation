This game became a game that made me me feel more than i had ever expected. The game is worth 10 bucks WELL WORTH. I really enjoyed it and say what you want but i cried several times ye im a panzy so what i feel no shame in that. If you have the money you should take This game for a spin and maybe you'll learn something.
this game is pretty terrible maybe worth 5 buck but 24 NO FRICKIN WAY zombies are jittery glitchy at times EXTREMELY hard to kill to begin with and the whole thing is kinda boring i get its in alpha but i expect better
