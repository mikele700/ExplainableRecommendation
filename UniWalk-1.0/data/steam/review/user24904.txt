Serious Sam on Mental makes Dark Souls look like Snake.
The only universe where you can mate a Neo-Nazi with a Negro.Costs 400Bucks> for the whole game3/10
Like a 10 hour long South park episode.-Tho I miss some big characters from the show, like Santa, Satan and Saddam. -It could be longer, considering it costs 40€. +Only game i'm buying Dlc' for.+Huge replay valueTENOUTTATEN!
Fun game I picked up for 10 Euros, long -campain-, lots of cars. Fancy graphics, good mechanics. The only problem is that you-'re gonna need a pretty good setup to run it to the max. Them shadows ya-' know8/10
Free to play*
Not worth the 23 Euros I spent. Fun game, but it gets really boring really fast. Buy it on a sale if anything. Recommended if you want to be a neo-nazistic dictator.
They finally added Kareem Abbdul Jabbar to the game so I really dont give 2 ♥♥♥♥♥ about the rest of the gameIt's ok.
