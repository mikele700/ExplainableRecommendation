When i sat down to play this game i came it was that good and i cried in the final cut scene, now go buy it now.
The PC that I played this on was a beast machine, however if you have a PC under $1000 it is almost impossible to play this game which is not acceptable seeing as most $1000 PCs have hardware better than that of a PS4. From my experience the game is good, it is certainly not a fitting end to the Batman Arkham trilogy (origins didn't exist). I was surprise that 70% of this game is Battank simulator 2015, not pleasantry surprise but definitely surprised. The 30fps capping is not acceptable at all in 2015.to bored to type anymore so 6/10 for me, if i wasn't on a beast machine 3/10TL;DR Batman Arkham Knight has stopped working
Spent two days downloading dosent work 10/10 would do it again
