I'm a 2 years old league of legends player and i have to admit that dota 2 is have something better than lol. It is a great game without imbalanced, no heroes are too strong or too weak, and it is fun too play, even though the open chest keys is kind of frustrating sometime.
Australia have allowed Rated R and this game still Rated M for kids with low violence and consored stuffs. Not recommended.
The realistic of this masterpiece is considerably huge. Love it.
Great TD games. Recommended.
