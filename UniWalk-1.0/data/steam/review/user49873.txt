A great game one of the best stories (maybe even the best). I love the simplicity of Thomas Was Alone, I've replayed it several times and each time its is still as amazing. I heard once that a game with hours and hours of gamplay is better then one with only 4 or 5 hours, but this is not true. Sometimes a story is told better in a few hours than a week. An awesome sound track and many loveable characters. There should be more games like this.Thomas Was Alone Awesome
