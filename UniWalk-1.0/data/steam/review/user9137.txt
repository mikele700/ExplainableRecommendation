Cave, the gods of bullet hell finally have arrived on steam.I was first introduced to this genre by Donpachi a little overs 5 year ago.Before that, the closest thing I had played were the likes of Xevious, Truxton and Thunder Force.For years I thought the shooting genre was just dead, then someone showed me MAME and I discovered shooters were not only alive and well, they were way better now,I didn-'t like emulating though, so I got into the import scene, getting a sega saturn, dreamcast, etc and imported my favourite titles.Cave made many of those favouritesWhen I logged into Steam one day and saw -mushihimesama now available- I just about ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my pants with excitement.This is a title by one of my favourite devs, I hadn-'t played it before coming to steam, but I bought it as soon as I saw it.The chance to support a developper like Cave and show them that there IS western interest in their games was something I jumped at.Now in this game, you play as Reco, a cute girl who rides on a beetle through the forests.You-'ll notice that the art style has a lot in common with Nausicaa Valley of the Wind, and that is a very good thing!The sprites are beautiful and the whole game has great attention to detail.That beautiful art combined with the amazing, (but sometimes downright evil) bullet patterns creates a great sense of awe.The gameplay is pretty typical of the genre, you must blast and weave your way through wave after wave of enemies, then take down a boss.It has 5 action packed stages and a secret boss if you can get to it.Your hitbox is tiny, and the bullets plentiful, thousands onscreen at once.I won-'t go too in depth about the game modes, but you get about 7 different ways to play, accomodating everyone from the beginner to the expert.Novice original is the most accessible game mode, thanks to it-'s inclusion, I highly reccomend this to anyone who would like to give this genre a chance but is afraid of the steep learning curve.However, if you-'re a veteran of the genre, turn it up a bit and you-'ll find yourself with a white knuckled challenge that will keep you busy for ages.As much as I love this genre I-'m not actually very good at it, so I have thoroughly enjoyed working my way up, I-'m yet to beat novice maniac but I have 1cc-'d original mode, which is something I wanted to achieve before I even thought about a review.Overall, this is the best shmup you can get on Steam right now, and I doubt that will change until Cave releases another game.This is an absolute must have!
This game is a love letter to a dead genre. If you're a fan of Outrun, Rad Racer, Hang on, etc you will find yourself right at home here.Super Night Riders doesn't really bring anything new, but it does refine things a little.You get excellent playability with spot on controls, a silky smooth frame rate and a visual style that is perfect for the genre.If you've never played a game like this, the basic idea is that you race the clock while avoiding your opponents, no realism, no gimmicks, just you and your skill.So if you like the old arcade racers, do yourself a favour, there probably won't be another like this.
I don't know what's happening but I know I like it. Masterpiece.
