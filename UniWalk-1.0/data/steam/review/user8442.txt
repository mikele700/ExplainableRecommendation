There is only ONE ♥♥♥♥ing problem with this game(well its not game itself), It-'s SQs Security System. If you play this game you may get the -suspicious activity restriction- Msg box when trying to log in, there are 3 ways to lift this restriction; Wait for it to lift itself(no idea how long) Reset your password (atm only viable method but not somthing i should have to be forced to do every ♥♥♥♥ing time i get this msg), or purchase and keyring/download a phone(my phone has downs) app that generates are secondary password consisting of random numbers(and letters i think). Now all i want to do is play this godly game. i bet by now you can see the problem. All it needs is a simple Email Verification consisting of a code so u can verify that it is infact YOU logging into YOUR account (exactly like GW2 with its IP Address change thingymajig) but apart from that, It-'s one of the best games i have every played. and i-'ve only played it 31 hours at the time of posting this :/
