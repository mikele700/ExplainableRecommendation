#edited# originally was a bit emotional#Ill make this positive once Wildcard speaks up - did they not expect a backlash from this? This could've been handled a billion different ways.I am not against different maps. I am against PAID dlc in an unfinished game.Theres a large group of people waiting for a list of glitches&/bugs + system(AI,collision,client+server side perf,etc) issues to be fixed before they play again and I think their anger is somewhat justified.Focus on finishing the game - up the price for the base game and put the dlc with it. Make it an 'upgrade' for existing  players maybe? Its honestly just saddening... Thanks Wildcard but no thanks to this.
