This is a great game.... its about team work , accuracy and agility, there is one bug that i have come across, it takes away your cross hair and all the vital information you need. such as ammo, map, health, points, how many enemies remain. But besides that i highly recommend this game.... definetly worth the $15
well its a great game the only thing is when i bought the game (not complete pack) i thought it would still come with the american and wermacht but it didint so if you guys do buy this please be warned!!!
