I was pretty suprised about the game, its epicness is something experience. As you run down a street you soldiers bleeding out, dying a horrible death or a constant flux of soldiers from both faction it gives you a sense of how insignificant you actually are. Best $10 spent so far.Cannon fodder and execution simulator 2014 10/10.
The main character ruined my experience, the story was not that good as well. I suggest Blood Dragon instead.
Shrek Blobs,  I approve
PTSD 10/10
