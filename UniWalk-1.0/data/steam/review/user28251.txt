I finished poral 2 and it feels so good to win. this is a fun game, I would reccomend it to anyone who wants a game to make them think. I have found it very challenging late in the game but the feeling of success hits you ike a truck on nitro when you figure out the test.
can be annoying if you pick the wrong path but still is interesting finding out how space warfare works!
