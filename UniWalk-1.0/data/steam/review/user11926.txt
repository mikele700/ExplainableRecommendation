At first I found this game a bit challenging, but after a bit of getting used to I have found it easier and is one of my favourite games of all time, recently I have been playing heaps and the community is a lot friendlier behind this game aswell, example at the end of a CS:GO game 'gg' at the end of a CoD game 'You fkn suck go to hell'. The game is well made and the continuous content updates are great, a good thing that separates Golbal Offensive from Source is the new guns and the weapon skins for each gun giving you the ability to have cooler looking guns, and more importantly StatTrak which gives players who can afford it the ability to count their kills. The micro-transactions in this game are not forced onto you but it is a good way to gamble, like if you spend $20 on an unboxing and get a $120 knife from it you made profit, or you lose money (that is why it's gambling), and the operations which give you earlier access to community made maps and keep a personal record of your competitive scores. This game is one of the best First Person Shooters out there and I'd give it a 9/10. The EMS competitions give players the chance to try get their name out there in the CS:GO community and also win big cash, and for those who are not a good enough player who can't assemble a team it is great fun to wath.
May be old and glitchy, but great gameplay and story line.
