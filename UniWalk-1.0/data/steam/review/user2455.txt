This game takes place on a fantasy world where beings control a vast amount of armies & creatures to take control of the fantasy realm called the old world beings like orcs - empire [ which is man] - vampires [ which control the dead & monsterous creatures] dwarves - & chaos.in campaign mode you go on missions and quests your rewards are either magical weapons and armour and followers some times.ive been playing the game for several hours i found each race has its ups & downs to make them unique to each other.the game handels well on my system, the game has verry nice graphics &actions in combat& i like airial combat as well.as empire you need to unite the empire which is not easy, you need to fight either the enimies of the empire or fight part of the emire to unite them to a common cause, but beware of chaos for they will try to destroy the unity of your achievements.bit that is not al, you must survive the chaos onslaught and any other enemy that comes along.& to conque other civilisezations that need to be swallowed up to meet the objectives as the empire.as the vampires you to need to meet objective destroy empire - bretonia - dwarves. but through missions & questyou get items & followers.empire gets war machines like steam tanks and veriety of cannons.vampires gets large monsters & dogs you could even through a spell materialize zombies on the battle field.orcs get boar riders -  giants - giant spiders - trolls.and other races get there own stuff as well. choas & orcs use the same kind of monsters like giants and trolls, but chaos gets a chaos dragon & a cannon.dwarves they are a faction unique to the game they are an advanced race with gyrocopters & a veriety of artillery pieces you can choose.the is stunning in graphics both campaign & in battle modes.i believe the game game is woeth it, i recomend it .its a bit like lord of the rings in a massive campaign & battle style, multiple armies on the battle field but in campaign mode can be hard to start off.
i like this you can do all most any thing in this game from building an under ground base to vertualy a castle. build mini bikes or build exploeding arrow heads or guns, even laying down a mine field. anything to keep your self alive through the game.find books to up date your knoledge to create things  its a good game
