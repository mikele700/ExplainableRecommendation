A simulation of manslaughter, murder, violence, self defence, agravated assault and grevious bodily harm.I am honoured I had the chance to play such an accurate reflection of what it is like to be in a bar fight.I recomend that the developers consider implementing the following: -Golf course map -Shopping mall map -Jersey shore style hardcore nightclub map -Hockey stadium map -Workshop -No in game purchases please :) -Beach map -Party map -Pool party map -school mapI am aware that the developers have predicted online/Co-op in early january 2016.I highly recommend buying this game if you wish to vent some built up anger, or simpily love gore like me.This game has so much potential, I have a sense of trust for those developing Such a masterpeice. The devs should be proud.7/10
10 outta 10 best saving simulator.If you want a game that forces you to saveevery second due to difficulty then buy this.                                                      10-10 IGN
F#@K YEAH! The best time waster this year!
This game is just outstandingly addicting for a hardcore online game! if your looking for a game where you slaughter as much as you get bruttally killed then this is the game for you!
