Team Fortress 2 is very awesome! Good graphics, very enjoyably and addictive! Hope that the game will go well in the future but, there are some things that's kinda out of hand. First is the community pricing about items, damn the price just keeps higher and higher! It's getting out of control. Besides that, everythings is all good! Get this game! #RatedM
