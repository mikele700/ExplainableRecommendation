BEST DLC EVER!Anyone who already owns Binding of Isaac must own this dlc because it add so many new enemies, bosses, floors, items and even a NEW CHARACTER!
ISAAC, AND HIS MOTHER...Best voice actor ever! Every game needs the person who did the intro in Binding of Isaac in every game.THIS GAME IS COMPLETELY AWESOME!
