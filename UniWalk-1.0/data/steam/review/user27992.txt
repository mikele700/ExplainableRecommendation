A very familiar formula to Far Cry 3, with the addition of dynamic elements incorperated into the game through unique vehicles, opponents, wildlife and NPC interactions. Through intriquet scripting and voicing, the charatcers you interact with throughout the game generally have an interesting field of depth, as they may reveal portions of their past and how their story came to be. With that being said, the highlighted antagonist, Pagan Min, demonstrates qualities that draw your attention like none other. Unlike the average villain that vows to elimate all who oppose's them, Pagan has an unsettling relaxed-attitude that makes the player wonder of the extensive past of this individual, grasping your attention. Like Vaas, you feel the desire to learn more of this fanatic. Pagan and Vaas are also two very opposing characters in their own unique way, as they excell in certain areas of development, with their own seperate strengths and weaknesses. Far Cry's antagonist reputation-bar has been raised once again.In correspondence to Far Cry 3's protagonist, Jason Brody, the ravine-gap of development that would be expected going from zero-to-terminator  was once again crossed with the easy breeze of a parachute. All possible development stages for the protagonist were once again stripped, as you dawdle out of a building and endeavour upon your massacre, keeping in mind you've never had a glimpse of knowledge towards the combat field. This mistake was also apparent in Far Cry 3, although atleast Jason stopped himself after his first kill, and reflected upon his actions, then proceeded to clear two islands.Tl;Dr - If you loved Far Cry 3, you'll love this even more. Hail Kyra.
