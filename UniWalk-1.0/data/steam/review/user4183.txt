great game, awesome soundtrack
Well I wouldn't characterise myself as a forthright authority on Civilization V but I sure have spent a lot of time playing haha. Here goes; Civilization V is one of the best games I have ever played and I recommend it to anyone looking for an extensive, vivid game that really challenges you. In my opinion, Vanilla Civ (just Civ5 without the DLC Brave New World) is pretty good but doesn't realise its full potential until you've got Brave New World; it changes the ways victory can be achieved adds on a neat amount of civs etc.This game has it all; a brush on combat that isnt overly complex but is still detailed nonetheless, u can defeat your opponents through cunning diplomacy or by overwhelming them with your superior culture.Civ5 is a pretty extensive game; and yes, one game can take quite a few hours so it's not for the lighthearted. Whether you play with friends or just Single Player, this game is bound to give you hours (or hundreds of hours) of fun and excitement, definitely worth in value as opposed to other games that you might play for a few hours and burn out.This is a game you can fondly go back to time to time and still derive great fun from; 10/10 Must Buy
