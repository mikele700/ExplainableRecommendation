Despite the graphical encounters, Mount and Blade: Warband will leave you feeling fufilled with a suitably deep and satisfying look at an intermediate-level medieval RPG. Hundreds of hours of discovery can be found within the punishing world of Calradia, where the progression from a small band of a dozen can evolve to an army of hundreds storming cities across the land. Reccommend for those interested in RTS, RPG and adventure in a third/first person medieval action setting. Choose your Faction!
