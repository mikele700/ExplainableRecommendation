dear diary today I cleaned some trash to so I could by some smut for a creep down an alley way to get a stone slab needed to appease this screaming skull.that was just one of my many diary entries that I have written in this game, at the end of every day the game presents you with your diary and tells you to write in it. now i could just write a joke entry or a few random letters and be done with it but instead I feel compelled to write a proper entry.now the main challenge of this game is to get rid of the skull that started following you afte you ate a strange eye and wandered into the sewers, however you will soon notice a big issue standing in your path: credits. you will need heaps of these and a whole heap of luck.luckily the game is rather peaceful and the mundane task of collecting trash can be quite fun if not a little frustrating once the incinerator runs out of charge and you have to ignore all the trash. another mechanic of the game is gendershifting which you will do around once a day unless you like grainy screens and vomit. some the more delightful genders i have gotten are the likes of -hellgender- and -cuddleslut-.overall i would reccomend this game and here is a tip slime guy likes slime smut, buy the fetishes of the gods and (untested but should work) buy two eyes of beb at the start and eat only one.
ok so i seem to be the only person on the internet who can enjoy a game without it having to meet the graphic quality of pcand i agree it is a higher price than it should be but i got the digital deluxe edition and love it and i care for microtransactions as they don't force you to buy gold in this game you earn it from doing quests and killing monster and there are even items the improve the gold you get. as for the battles: i find that they can still be tough no matter what level you are. my only problem with this game is the black smith as you'll spend loads of gold getting him up to 50% and still waste gold when you fail to craft an item other than that i think that this is better than the ios relese mainly because of the new content in the digital deluxe edition. but i at least recomend getting this game and giving it a try.
i highly recomend this game having spent most of today playing it i can without a doubt say it is one of the best indie games i've played
