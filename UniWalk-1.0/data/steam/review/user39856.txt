Best game I have ever played
The servers are always full and you are stuck in a waiting screen for almost an 1 hour. saying that there are only US servers and EU servers We need Australian server. But once you are in there is F@$k All stuff around because the servers are full to the brim. but once you get in to it its lots of fun. (ps The lag Is bad in most servers i would give it a month or 2 to fix its isses before you buy. :)
