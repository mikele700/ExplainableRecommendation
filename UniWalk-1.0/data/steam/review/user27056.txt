10-10 best game ever
Fantasic game dieffently worth the $20 I payed for it. In my opinion this is the best Battlefield game ever. It has a fantasic frostbite engine, nearly everything is destructible
This is a great little game
bloody good game buy it NOW!!!!
Sniper Elite V2 is a fun game to play with friends in the Co-op mode but that and the single-player feel extremly scribed. I love the bullet cams. This game is great for $15<  but nothing more.
This is a really fun game to play with friend, but pretty boring by yourself.
This game is da best sh*t ever. How many games can you say that you stab a pirate as a ninja and then expoled by cannon.
This game is a but load of fun! 8/8 M8 GR8 BA8R.I.P BerniceR.I.P TyroneR.I.P ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
