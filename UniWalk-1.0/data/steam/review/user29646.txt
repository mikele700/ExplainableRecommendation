excellent! got 50 hours out this mother f*cker9/10 slightly buggy
When i saw this i thought it looked really damn awesome and i was reallly looking forward to it. i patiently waiting for it to download and install. and then when it was finally finished i launched the game. it sat on a white screen for about half an hour and it is still on that white screen whenever i launch the game. please help me. i want to play but i cant.
When i saw this game i thought it would be very fun but i was pleasantly surprised and now i cant really seem to get enough of it. i really do enjoy it. i am very happy with this reasonably cheap purchase.
the ♥♥♥♥er doesnt work11/10
its extremely intense for a begining horror fan like me but all in all a good game 3.5/5
EPIC GAME FANTASY
