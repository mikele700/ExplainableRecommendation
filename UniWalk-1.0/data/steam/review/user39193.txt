this is a great game even against bots, but the loading screen will crash when you play human opponents. When this problem gets fixed, then this game will be great
If you have any interest in football or soccer then I highly recommend this game, becoming more realistic with each version, corner kicks are much better also
This is a great game but the problem is matchmaking, you may go up against a party of players in unranked and you will lose. Unless you have friends in a party in unranked games you wont enjoy yourself that much. Finding ranked games is semi hard but at least you dont have to play against a party of players, you can play in solo matchmaking games in ranked
