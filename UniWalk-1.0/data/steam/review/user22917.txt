They executed the (team) game in a poor way, there is no 5 man squads, no descent voice communication and no indicator to tell you if your talking or not in game and there are a crap ton of griefers.
this a broken game, the steam authentication is broken and the multiplayer crashes the game whenever I try to join the server. evan though I only payed $1 for this game, I feel that that dollar was throwen into the sea. the game is very unstable which can really ♥♥♥♥ me off sometimes!
bloody horrible, is literally a game made in Unity and the graphics are either crappy cheaply made 3D visuals or google images.... I'm not kidding..............Don't play this game what so ever! It is pure crap
It's a great game, would suggest you play it.recommendations for devs:Add workshop to the game (the 4 maps get boring)Add more maps to the game
