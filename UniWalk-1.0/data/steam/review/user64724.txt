Fantastic Game! It allows one to think really deep into the obstacles in this game but sometimes mind crushing. I had to think for 30 mins to solve a map before.
Fantastic game! Lots of gamemodes and large variety of weapons. Not those type of MMO's that is not paid to win where everything is that is exclusive is possible to get if you take the time and hours to farm for it.
It's been a long way since Elder Scrolls started and this is the best one yet. Skyrim has enhanced the limits of multiple games and proved that a sword-slashing-gory-game is possible. Not to mention the mods makes the game alot more interetsing as well.
After playing 500 hours on this fantastic FPS, it's gameplay and multiplayer action is just spot on, expected of Valve. It's realistic recoil and other features make this game a must buy!
