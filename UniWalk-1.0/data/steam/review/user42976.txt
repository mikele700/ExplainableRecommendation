Portal 2 is an amazing game. The graphics are excellent for a game released about 1-2 years ago. The puzzles are really challenging and it makes your brain think but in a fun way. This is a lot better than school and if you are want a game with comedy, puzzles and futuristic scenery and design, then buy Portal 2!
