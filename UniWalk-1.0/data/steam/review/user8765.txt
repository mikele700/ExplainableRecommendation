Good if you like War Thunder and Space games, as it has the plane aspect of War Thunder with the flying around and shooting and the Space aspect as it is set in space. The things that make Star Conflict different from War Thunder is the different classes and abilities and factions. I will give a brief run down on the classes and factions. The classes fall into 3 major catagories and alot of sub-classes. The 3 main classes that you will encounter is the Interceptor class; which is designed for speed and maneuvelbility, the Fighter class; which is a class that is a good alrounder, and the Frigates; which is designed for Powerful cannons and strong armour. There are also 3 factions that holds all 3 main classes of ships. The 3 factions are: Empire, Federation and Jericho and if you want to go to the back stories, follow this link --> https://star-conflict.com/en/game/storyline <--. There are 15 ranks not including ships that need to be Manufactured. Each rank has differnet ships per rank and the Crew and Workshop options only occur for when you get a rank 4 and rank 6 ship for any factions. There are 2 gamemodes in Star Conflict that are PvP and PvE. PvP is a head to head combat style gamemode for where the pplayer will be given certain tasks, depending on the mission, to either capture beacons, kill the enemy etc. Then there is PvE, which is where the player fights bots throughout missions to receive points. Then there is Syntax Points wihch is what the player needs to upgrade their ships to go to the next rank. And that is a brief run-down on Star Conflict
