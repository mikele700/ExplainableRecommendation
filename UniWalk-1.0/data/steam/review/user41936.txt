Holy crap this is a $1?!?!?!?!!BUY THIS GAME.It's a really well polished tower defence game with all the old Black and White Alien Invader tropes and references.Sooooooooooooo worth it!
DO YOU WANT YOUR MIND BLOWN?DO YOU WANT THE VERY CONCEPT OF REALITY TURNED ON ITS HEAD OVER AND OVER AGAIN LIKE A BABY IN A WASHING MACHINE?DO YOU WANT TO TALK IN CAPS LOCK WHENEVER YOU TALK ABOUT THIS GAME?
I don't even need to say anything else except THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST GAMES OF OUR GENERATION!.
Oh man, great indie for only $2 WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Seriously though , there's a tower defence game mode and a versus mode that's really fun but what you really want this for is the multiplayer. Heck get it with a friend and you're only paying $1.60 each. That's two potato cakes or a really good game your choice really.
It doesn't look like much, but the simple graphics hide a really good zombie-survival strategy game with an on-going campaign where every decision you make actually has long term effects. You are an evacuation manager who has to co-ordinate the evacuation of civilians and (hopefully) the eradication of zombies. If you like Indie games and/or enjoy strategy/management, this is worth it.
FREE FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   FREE FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WHY WOULD YOU NOT PLAY THIS GAME!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!FREE FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   FREE FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just like the classic Worms of old! Remember those 2d days when you'd spend hours on end in grudge matches to see who's the best? If you like Worms 2 and Worms World Party then you'd love this!
