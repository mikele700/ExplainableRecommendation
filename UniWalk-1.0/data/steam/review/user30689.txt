Hi there everyone TF2 is class game. Choose a class, kill enemies, push carts, capture flags, and other things await you in this awesome game! Also a hat simulator xDLel
I recommend it! It's really cool! But remember... If he's at your door. Stare at him. If a ventilation error happens in night 3 and on... You die! Best horror game 10/10
