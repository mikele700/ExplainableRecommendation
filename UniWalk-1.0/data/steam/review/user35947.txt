TSW is a great game that deviates from the standard mmorpg guidelines. It's well worth checking out and I highly recommend it, particularly when it's on sale. I found the game very enjoyable, but a little on the harder end on the difficulty spectrum. For that reason, I played through the game with a friend, which added a lot to the gaming experience.
