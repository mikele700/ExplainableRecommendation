unturned rip offworst game ive ever played...literally
Good game although i find the dodge mechanics very unfair, as soon as you finish dodging an attack you get hit immediatly. The health regeneration is way too slow, But otherwise pretty good game.
I Love This Game Its So Fun!But It Will Be Better With Co-Op
Online Multiplayer Needs To Be AddedSometimes It Counts 1 More Than Needed So If Somemone Rolls 7 Sometimes It Will Move 8 Or 6
Best Game Ever Sooooo Addicting Go And Download And TAAAAP To Win 9001/10
