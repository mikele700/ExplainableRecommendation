At the moment this game is quite ♥♥♥♥ as the servers are almost always down (due to the amount of players wanting to play) but playing it was quite enjoyable for the short amount of time i played it. It is a good idea to stay away from this game unless you like playing it or like seeing a game progress and evolve from a beta piece of crap into a lovely butterfly XD.
metal slug is just like the old ones, mindless fun.But the best kind of mindless fun riding animals with mounted guns whislt killing zombies that explode upon shot 10/10 XD
