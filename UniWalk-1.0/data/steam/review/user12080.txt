Man this game... Its hard to explain how GOOD it is but here are some PROS and CONS.PROS:Great atmosphere.Nice basic animations.Good ai.Some of the best textures, sounds, and art I have ever seen for a well made mod.CONS:Can be slow paced but not all of the time.Some trolls who like to keep the bandages and pills.For a HL2 mod this is quite fun and I really enjoyed playing. ( I suck at explaining but thats it.)8.5/10Now... time to kill some ZOMBIES!
When i first bought the game I thought it would'nt be that good but surprisingly its good.The story is good, the combat feels nice and customizing is amazing!
