Very fun not quite up to war with some older ghost recons but a good time passer and great team play game if you get a team to play together lol
If your a real time strategy person such as my self you will love this game its super rich enviroments and amazing charecters and lanscapes.So far i have played as the elves and been very satisfied but the humans seem powerful as well one of my fave steam games and its free-to-play so jump on no need not to!
