Aight for starters, this game looks mad but the gameplay is aight... after you put in a lot of time and effort to get your ♥♥♥♥ together. So much cancer and respawning for the first 90 levels, it gets better once you're about level 90 and above.You will encounter countless amounts of virgins who dedicate their lives to this game, as I have encountered many, getting ♥♥♥♥♥ every time. To counter that, I have a lifeless virgin who leads me and I use to bait, SmashDog. Weapons don't really matter as much as it would in CS:GO how skins make you better, but the guns in the game do have special stats or abilities, some are utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's all skill and tactics, two things that I do not possess therefore this game is too hard.The thing that makes me continue to play this game is the strive to unlock useless ♥♥♥♥ like max level abilities that make no ♥♥♥♥ing difference. The community is crazy funny and nice, unless you're KevinRudd. Each faction has their unique skills and weapons, which I call all of them OP because I'm toxic. The one thing I would like to change is the customizing of characters, there's armors and camos that you can buy but none of them are nude :( pls add nude armor
