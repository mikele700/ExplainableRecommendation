10/10Great game, with lots of blood and fun, there are so many mods to download and it's tons of fun. You can play from survival, missions to simple kill and run. Definitely recommend playing ;)
Archers can spam 10/10
Best game I've played that's in Early Alpha, now with the new updates and more servers, it's going to be awesome, I hope that the devs continue being awesome too :3 Great game 10/10 :missing:
If you don't get captured enough, you're not playing it right(I'm not writing this seriously, just a stud.)
As a fan of DC comics this game presents its characters really well, espiacially the Joker. The combat is really free-flow, smooth and satisfying in every hit. The story would not impact you the same way games like Portal or HL-series do but it does leave memorable moments. It could really be summarized to -Punch, save someone, Punch, win :D-I wished there was a arena mode or something that can let me punch people indefinitely, but the closest you get is the ranked challenges :IRecommended, gameplay is smooth, polished and well done.Recommended: 9/10
