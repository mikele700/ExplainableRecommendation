The game is very fun, but the absurd amount of bugs doesn-'t compensate for it. Even if you get this game for free, it isn-'t worth playing it due to insane life monsters spawning from nowhere, deaths without any apparent reason and things like those. I also need to mention that the screen sometimes freeze and blackout even with no apparent consumption of computer resources. I understand that the Gamemaker platform is a little bit hard to work with but this game shouldn-'t be considered finished due to these problems, so I already tried a refund request(even with 4 hours of -gameplay-, or pure stress if you prefer), and even if it doesn-'t work, I hope someone reads this and pay attention to know that buying this game is a peril to your mental sanity. I-'d just like to wish you a nice day, because some time of mine was completely wasted playing this.
