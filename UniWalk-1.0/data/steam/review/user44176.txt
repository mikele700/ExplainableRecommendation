Honestly, this may be my new favourite PC game. I picked it up on sale a few months ago and I haven't found this much enjoyment in a game since Kingdom Hearts II. It has a good story that isn't too in depth, funny charecters, good map creation, too many guns to count, great RPG elements, a good range of charecters and four player co-op. For $10 this game is a complete steal and if you have the money I definately recommend the GOTY edition.9.5/10
