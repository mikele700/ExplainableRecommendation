After playing 0.1 hour, I feel like I've seen enough of the game's P2W style structure that other's speak of. I'm amazed that a character can be unlocked for a single game, a day or a week (with less ability to do the latter). Inventive for taking the dark theme to a MOBA, but beyond that, disappointing.
