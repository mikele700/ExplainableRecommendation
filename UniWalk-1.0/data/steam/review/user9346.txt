A masterpiece with amazing art design, beautiful music and an emotionaly moving story line. Gameplay wise, it's pretty easy to handle due to the fact it is a 2D based game that uses the keys to move. The puzzles in this game are challenging and get your brain to work, which is great. However, some moments in this game (like in many other puzzle games) are immencely frustraiting but can be overcome.... after a couple tries at it that is.  Needless to say though, it brought me to tears and is, in my opinion the best game of 2014. I highly recommend it to others for a change in the usual and for an experience that will stay with you for the rest of your life.
