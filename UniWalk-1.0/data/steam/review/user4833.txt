A solid dlc, new campaign, multiple new factions with each having new medieval styled units. It gives a good total war medieval 3 vibe. Although the rosters are small, I would say its defenitely worth the price but if your tight on money wait till it goes on sale.
This game is one of my favourite rts/turned base strategy games of all time
