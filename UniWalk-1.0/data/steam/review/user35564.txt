Hell yea i do really enjoyable game may be old but still awesome
Ok This game is amazing needs abit of work team mates need to learn what teamwork is but other than that 8/10
Counter Strike Daycare Operations is what this game should be called full of stupid children that think they are the best things on the planet because there parents a do not love them or B dont care for them and just dump them infront of this rubbish
this game is pretty good just need patience and skills
this game is ♥♥♥♥ worst in men of war series by far unless youl ike missions where you can controll 4 men  you cant even controll helicopters init only multiplayer is co op id give this ♥♥♥♥ a miss and save your money
