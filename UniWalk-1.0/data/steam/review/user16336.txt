if you like burning orcs with a fiery sword then buy this dlc its not that bad of a rune eh
Graphics are amazing, combat is great it's a bit repetitive from time to time, but with the okay story to support the combat and amazing graphics, I would give the game 7/10
very nice
As you enter in the limbo of the dead and lost kingdom of drangleic you must fight your way through incredibly hard bosses and other hostiles, You can get a hang of it if you actually pay attention to the grave stones in the tutorials and light bonfires as you trot a long. This game is filled with fantasy which makes it fun the trading system is amazing, and sometimes hostiles can be a bit too tough to kill. I would give this game a 8/10 it could be fustrating sometimes but the key thing i like about this game is the idea and the amazing fantasy world the game makers put in for us to enjoy. I recently bought this game and so far I am loving it, even how much I die or loose thousands of souls this game will always be in my top ten favorites!
it be amazing lel
Glad that it's free to play now, fun and enjoyable game, great job turtlerocks studio for making a gigantic leap and extending the life time of this game. This game now has a 25,000% increase in players. Fun and unique, although it takes a bit of time to find the monster; when engaging in combat it is surely worth the length of finding the ******
