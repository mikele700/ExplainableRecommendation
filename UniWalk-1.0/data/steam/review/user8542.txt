This is (shall i say it) the best Free-to-Play game on Steam. Yeah, yeah Dota 2 is very nice and it (maybe) has an equal amount of players on Steam. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not Free-to-Play. I wouldn-'t say not to play them, but Team Fortress 2 is a good game to start your Steam experience. Team Fortress 2 is like practice for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in a way that they are both shooter games. Team Fortress 2 also has as many players as Dota 2. There is a famous quote that says -The more, the merrier-, right? This game supports that statement. There are a very small amount of empty servers every now and then, but there is always a server that is full (even during midnight!).          To conclude this review, I would like to say thanks to Gaben and more power to Team Fortress 2!-Fissure.Ko (Chris)
