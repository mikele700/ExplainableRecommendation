Ive only played this DLC for a good 2 hours and I've made a memory I'll be fond of for a good time. Having everything i chopped down taken by monkeys and manure thrown at me by another monkey. Being the level headed person i am, I then proceeded to burn down the forest they inhabited including their house. Karma came full swing then when i realised i burned everything on the small island, which left me stranded until i starved.10/10 will burn again
Frying pans. Who knew right?10/10
Good times destroying everything with a star on it, killing lots and lots of people, and zooming around in a car, plane, boat, a parachute or a grappling hook.
