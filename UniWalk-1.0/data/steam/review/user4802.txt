I have played them all, this one is OK not greatBiggest isssue other game itself are the HACKS You need to get rid of them or at least try. They are seriously erroding you franchise at least on PC, I wonder if you care? I know from the people whoI play HC with the same hacks play all the time and while everyoner reports they remain. I have heard that some players have even taken legal steps under Australian consumer law ie assessing the game as not -as advertised -. Wake up before you don-'t have a core fan base on PC IF you care???
