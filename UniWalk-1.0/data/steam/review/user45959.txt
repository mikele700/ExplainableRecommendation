Despite being in Beta, this game is AWESOME. Best $15 I've spent ina while.
One tap broekn 0/10
Even paying $20 for this is an absolute steal. Played it on PS4 at a friend's and was so impressed that I bought it and played the (insert word) out of it. It never fails to entertain me, even after all the hours I've invested (YES, MICHAEL THIS IS STILL A GOOD GAME, TITANFALL WASN'T. THAT WAS A FLUKE).Also cross-play's pretty g (when you get it working...)
