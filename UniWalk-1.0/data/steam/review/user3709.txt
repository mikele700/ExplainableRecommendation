GunZ 2: The Second Duel is a very fast paced game that is only playable because of its 3rd person mode. I highly reccomend this game for adrenilen junkies (sorry for spelling) and people who love defying gravity by wall running. You can play this game smartly, by wall jumping while shooting your enemy, or by playing brutaly, putting together furocious combos that destroy your enemy. When in doubt about this game try it out, it will be a new experience and the game is free so you don't need to worry about money.
