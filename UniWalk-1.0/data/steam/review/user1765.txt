Amazing game, hundreds of hours of gameplay and never gets old with so many mods to download and use
It's a great game but there is too much focus on the story so that when you finish it (if you've done some side quests as well) it fells like there is barely any end game content. Also the dialogue has been dumbed down WAY too much and you are pretty much forced into the role of the good guy. Overall good game, meh RPG, pretty bad Fallout
