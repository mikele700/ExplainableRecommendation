Graphics arent very goodI use a steering wheel and the force feedback is all wrongYou cant change controls while racing. So if you need to and your in career you either have to wait until the end or throw away the race and then you cant recomplete itIf you just bump a fence or something like that it pulls the whole car aroundAll the stages within a rally look exactly the same. If you go stage 1 and then stage 2 you will find that they have the same corners which makes for really boring gameplayI love the WRC but they deffiently should get someone of better quality to make their gameIve played online free to play games that are better quality then this
