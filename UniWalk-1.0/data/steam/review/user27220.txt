Definitely recommended for people who love to trade hats for hundreds or thousands of dollars.Basically if you have no money, you will automatically find a job and then spend all of your salary on hats.Hats are love, hats are life.But really, TF2 is actually a really great game for whoever likes FPS games with fast-pacing and different environments.TF2 is truly a fun game. It never really gets old, whenever I play it, I always am entertained by the different people I meet on the servers, if you want new friends, this game will introduce a huge amount of audiences. And now I am lazy to write. See ya nerds including myself since I will now enter the Team Fortress 2 dungeon and return in a E.T.A of 10,000,000 years.
