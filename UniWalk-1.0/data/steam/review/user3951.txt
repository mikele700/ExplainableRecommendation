I got this game at the $14.99 sell and when I start off as bumblebee I felt very impressed when I first saw the first Cutscene where Optimus was talking to Bumblebee about they had no choice but to leave Cybertron. The only problem I have with it is half way when the Combaticons were combining it suddenly pause and became a green screen but I manage to solve the problem by skipping the cutscene. So yeah 100% RECOMMENDED
I got 3000+ hoursI so lifelessgod helppls:(
Really great game but I do not recomend playing online with random players even just joining the game and saying hi you are just going to be voted off nothing else. The community of this game is terrible and horrible and all other negative words. But by far a really great game. Just only play solo or close friendsDickbutt. Joined the gameDickbutt: hi guysVote to kick Dickbutt.? Yes Yes Yes YesYou have been voted off.
