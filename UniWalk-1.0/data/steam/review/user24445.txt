OH GOD WHY. WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE PARKINSONS DISEASE? WHY? AND WHY CAN'T I AIM?
Such potential. It's a great game, but it feels a little too short, too rushed, like you need the DLC to experience an actual GAME.
Great game.(side note): WHY CONNOR WHY U SO GOOD I WILL GET REVENGEANCE UPON YOU! I SWEAR TO BABBY JEBUS!
'Great fun, Great game, Great Mechanics that work properly, it's really just great.' - Some Hobo'I enjoyed it. I mostly mashed buttons and things happened on a big flashy thing. 10/4.' - Some Canadian'I actually really like the customisation, the satisfaction of haviang a good, unique weapon that I made from the parts I have unlocked. You never forget that feeling when you make a gun, try it out, and by god it's the best frickin' thing ever.' - A Nerd
