I find these stories about dystopic societies (even if the dystopic elements only apply to a particular class, race or sex; in this case, women) to be scarier than any horror story. Watching as everything goes wrong, and that feeling when you realize that those few selfish individuals responsible for everything have managed to take control to such an extent that there is nothing left to do but give up. This game, like the previous, manages to capture that feel through the perspectives of a number of different characters, each of which you'll probably grow to appreciate as time goes by, and then you'll hate Christine Love when terrible things happen to them.also kawaii ai girl harem <3
I wholeheartedly recommend this game, as one of the pinnacles of game design; simple enough for anybody to understand (point at the zombies and shoot), but with a massive amount of depth and replayability in the perk system (one game, you can decide to focus on building as many powerful sentry guns as possible, another you get all the damage increases you can get, etc.) Beyond that, the game just feels good to play; all the weapons feel like they have impact, explosions are satisfying, and the experience progression gives you the warm feeling inside that only watching numbers increase and occasionally receiving rewards can.
