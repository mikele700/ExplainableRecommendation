The mixture of minecraft and COD but with more game modes and epic proportions. The game is very fun and addicting and is one of the best FPS games i've played. At first when you buy the game, you kind of regret, but when your actually play the game 6 hours straight, after that it starts to get really fun.  If it is on sale, I say get it because it is worth the money. I think it is extraordinarilly better than the free version (buildandshoot.com). I recommend this game to people who like minecraft and FPS games. People who say there's no one on any servers and the game in general is not fun, I say screw you and ♥♥♥♥ off.
