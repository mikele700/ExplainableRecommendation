one of the best metal gears to exist. hands down. after having bad times with msg4 & 5 not feeling like Metal gear at all this was a Nostalic kickback as whell as a fresh new way of doing fps shooters.
One of the best in the Fallout series so far but still not without issues even though the game has issues. and i guess i cant really complain about framrate lag since i dont think my pc is upto spec's im just glad to play it. and actualy like plating it enough not to use the cheat engine. dont really like the 4 choice limit. but everything else is solid. and im really glad supermutants you cant just snipe from far away they are way harder to deal with.
