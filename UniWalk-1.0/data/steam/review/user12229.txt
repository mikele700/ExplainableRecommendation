If you're saying there isn't enough content in this game then you clearly havn't played enough. Once you start exploring you realise how big the map really is. This is a great game with a really interesting concept and I would love to see it grow. I definitely reccomend you buy this game RIGHT NOW!
Gr9 m9 9/9. Would play again
