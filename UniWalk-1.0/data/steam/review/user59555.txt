i really wanted to play this game so badly, looked at the reviews and after that i straight away installed the game, didn't take  long and as i launched it i was so excited. I watched the tutorial, i was so HYPED. Then..... i tried to look for a match..... waited over 10 minutes, still nothing. i just gave up, if there were many more people playing this game i would certainly come back to it but right now, theres barely anyone on.. i was so disappointed. I will try finding a match another day but if i can't for a while i'll just probably uninstall it. so sad...
