The game is great, until the hype train came around, now infamy means nothing and you cant gage skill by level anymore. If you get the game you need to learn it, dont use a high level pro, or hacker to get you to infamy in less time than it takes to learn the game. But if you have the patience to sit around fixing drills and waiting for guards to stop camping in bad places, you will find this game is the best bag moving simulator around. Should you choose to be a scrub and only go loud you are a scrub and should to be patient, i mean sersiously you may find shooting at dozers fun, but theres nothing more exhilarating than almost losing your last pager, or almost running into a group meeting of guards while attempting to move that last bag to the van.Also learn to love and praise RNGesus for he is the saviour, the only true way to win is through his gift of dodge
