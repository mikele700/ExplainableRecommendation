TF2 was my favourite game until the Meet Your Match update. I started playing Overwatch but TF2 was still my favourite. But Valve rushed to beat Overwatch and added a heap of similar things to TF2 that could be seen in Overwatch. This game is now crap. Valve is trying so hard to fix the game. I can tell you how to fix it in one sentence. Get rid of Meet Your Match. Don't install until the fix the game. They should pay. Those greedy bakas at Valve.
