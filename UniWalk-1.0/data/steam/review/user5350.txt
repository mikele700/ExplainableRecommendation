Love this game, Stratergy and simplicity all placed together, just like the new game *Planetary annihilation*, just PA is a little bit more fancy on the graphics and centers everyone with the same units and building structures. Rather joyful game, I once again recommend buying this game, and thank you Bubbles for getting this for me. :DOi, That means get it.

Funny as hell game, Can turn into a ultimate cluster-♥♥♥♥ of traps then monsters within a few seconds.If you are going to play this game, better playing it with others which improves the enjoyment which can be found from a game as simple as this.
