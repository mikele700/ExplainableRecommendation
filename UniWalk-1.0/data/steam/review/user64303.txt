*Gets kicked for not surrendering gets 7 day ban*just great....
Cant even find server very disapointed not worth even a tf2 key which I payed for in a trade... Devs get your act together go to ign or somthing tell em' you got some awsome update that will fix this game, lower price to $2.5-$5 or go f2p and use cosmetic buys but dont make it pay 2 win... (Tactical Intervention) You will get attention trust me guys i played this on xbox and really enjoyed myself. The mayjor problem is that the game punishes us pc players, i mean it freaking launced in window mode, WINDOW MODE. Needs more resolution options! (I HATE BLACK BARS) no aus server, at all i played for ten minutes 3 minutes trying to fix options and 2 minutes in a 300 ping EU server then the game crashed and now im cross! I dont think you devs will see this please, please fix this game :( Again has potential and it is a great back to bacics shooter I also enjoy the bullet lighting it gives it a cool look.
Im 3 hour's in an already enjoying the yehawww out this epic game what is it with me and f2p games? If i had to pay for this game I would! 10/10 great standalone.
