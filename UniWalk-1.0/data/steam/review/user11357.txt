A lot more challenging than the first one and therefore lots more fun. Some puzzles made me want to punch someone though.
As an avid fan of both, Picross and Minesweeper, this game was like heaven. It's a bit short and only the last few levels are at all challenging, but it is lots of fun and definitely worth $3 and a couple of hours.
