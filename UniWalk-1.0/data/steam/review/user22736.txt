pretty fun game for a free tp play. Lots of action. Awesome
weirdist game ive ever seen, pretty boring. quit after 2 levels
what can i say, This is one of the best games on steam. A very good realistic military simulator with lots of to be had. I have spent almost 200hours on it. And its perfect for dayz
