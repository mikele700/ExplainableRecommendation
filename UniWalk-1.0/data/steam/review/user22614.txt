Tons of Fun if you can play Toxic players if your new so it's best to start off with some good old fashion Tutorial (League of legends) Can't seem to get reborn to work on mac but eh it'll probs be fixed hopefully....
Great game however it's still missing bits and peices that can make it better for example Each species should have their own traits for example the the fish species should be able to breathe underwater the avians should be able to glide to sum extent. just little things like this can make it so much better.
