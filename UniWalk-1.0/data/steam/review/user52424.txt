The game is very fun, with great gameplay, a interesting story and you do feel like a ancient powerful warrior striking down his foes. Plus it's a four player co-op game which makes it even more enjoyable.
Who ever reads this, must download this awesome free-to-play, massively multiplayer online first person shooter as soon as possible it is one of the best games I have ever played.
One of the most epic free to play, first person shooter game I have ever played.NOTE: Whoever is reading this review now (which I doubt personally), and doesn't agree with this review I made. Please note that this review is made before the release of the PS4 version which casue the PC version to be out of date now. I haven't play the game for a long time but what I have read from other reviews has kept me up to date with what has happen to the game now and it's sad to hear that Blacklight is no longer being focus by the developers anymore because of the PS4 version.
Another great co-op game by Valve.
Best free to play, multiplayer online, first preson shooter game ever, of all time.
