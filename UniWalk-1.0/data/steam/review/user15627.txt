I used to recomend this game, but after 6+ years of playing it there has been so little change that i can longer recomend it. Maybe after the fabled engine update comes out (whenver the hell that'll be) that might change. But with the ownership of the game currently under the money milking copany G1, nothing will happen. There hasn't been any change in 6+ years, the haker problem is getting worse, half the weapons are unbalanced, and there are many more issues that make this game hard to enjoy, even with all of the potential it had
