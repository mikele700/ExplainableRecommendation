If you're looking for a great horror game. This is it. There's no way to kill the enemies/monsters, you only have three choices to get away. Run, hide or die. As soon as you get in the game it's smack into the horror and keeps you on your toes. Highly reccomend this game. 80/100 on metacritic for an indie game is pretty f*&^ng good if you ask me, and this game lives up to your expectatiohns.
