I've played this game since my childhood, revisiting it every year or so to play it again, so seeing it in early access is wonderful. The controls are simple to use and the music and visuals are very nostalgic. If you've played the original game, probably one of the best and most notable things that they've done to update it so far is allowing for 8-directional shooting (up from the original 4-directional).
