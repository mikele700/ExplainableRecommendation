Ace of Spades and i have a love hate relationship, originally playing it off a browser download, i was constantly kicked and banned for causing damage to allied structures. The Steam release falls to the wayside, trying to become THE block game shooter.A truly fun concept which will satisfy the trolliest of trolls, and make you laugh for the one night you decide to play.
