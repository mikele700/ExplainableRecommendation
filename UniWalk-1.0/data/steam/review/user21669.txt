Best RTS game out there IMO. Simply fantastic.
what the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with the match queues?? i can't find a match as a 2-man without attempting at least 15 times. fix this ♥♥♥♥ please
I had high hopes for Shift 2 but NOPE, EA just had to F!CK IT UP! 0/10. The handling is equivalent to driving a f!cken BULLDOZER on a racetrack.. and on top of that, the compatibility is just crap. Crashes every start up. Validating file integrity will NOT help!! ♥♥♥♥ GAME!!!
blow sh!t up, rip brawlers apart, eat zambies, turn your arm into a blade... 10/10 ok :)
blow sh!t uuuuppp! hell yeah :)
FKN LOVE THIS GAME!! the atmosphere, theme, setting! cannibals scary af though :(hopefully more elements are added consisently through development!! still fun :)
2Fun.. srsly,
Very fast paced game. Fun, intense and everything you'd want in a stickman based game!
It's all about the co-operation or you dead fo' sure. Well-made slow-mo kill effects. Overall fun game!
