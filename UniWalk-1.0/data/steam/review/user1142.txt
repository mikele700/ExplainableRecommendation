This game gets worse and worse over time.The developers constantly add new stuff, which allways breaks the previous updates and overall makes the game unplayable.Lets take plasma guns, you used to be able to have +1 overteir guns, about 4-5 of them built around a weak robot. Now that you can-'t overtier at all, the plasma guns can-'t do enough damage to be effective in battle at all.  Tis is because of these previous -updates-1. Damage nerf. (acceptable at the time)2. Damage nerf & removed dynamic airm reticle. (acceptable at the time)3. Damager nerf then boost4. Shot nerf (prevents more than 6 guns fireing at a time (acceptable as it was the same for all guns)5. reloading nerf, more guns equal less shots per minute. (acceptable as you could over tier for extra damage)Now with the no overtier rule Plasma now are completly useless as.1. you can only shot 6 plasmas balls on tier, that can do maybe 4-7 blocks of damage2. if you have more guns it-'s pointless because they still won-'t shoot, but you-'ll lose maybe 4-5 guns from getting shot at while your plasma-'s reload.3. SMG-'s just rush you maximising their time at max DPS ripping you to shreads.This update made me un-install Robocraft.Do not bother with even testing this -free to play- game.
This new update, moving from alpha to beta v.7.5 is a huge improvement!Firstly the online survival mode actually works you can actually do the things in the videos.Harvesting and building new weapons, walls, floors, explosives, vehicles is now in the game.
This game is just not ready, Noone can even play all you do is lobby bounce when the ready timer hits 0.
Quirky game with much button mashing.
