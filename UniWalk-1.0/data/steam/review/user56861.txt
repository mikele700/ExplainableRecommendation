This is a very good game for an Indie Game which is free mainly because updates keep on comming and no matter what, there are no downsides (excluding a few) which add new choices to battle with.
This game is awsome and if your a SimCity 2013 fan, you should get this gameIm gonna find u and hug u - Stalking Pinkie Pie
