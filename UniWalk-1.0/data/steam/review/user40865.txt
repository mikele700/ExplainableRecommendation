So its only in open beta at the moment, but its a real solid game right now. Sort of what TF2 would be if TF2 wasnt such a muck around game. Its hella fast paced - movement speed is really high for all classes, and you can wall jump and stuff - and mostly balanced. There are minor balance issues but the game is constantly being updated and as such the game is generally getting more balanced with each patch. The company behind this game seems to quite involved with the community as well, and is constantly adding and trialling new content which is nice. My only really gripe is its pay model. Like most free to play fps games, you have the option of buying sidegrades with both real and in-game currency. Each Merc (class) costs a ludicrous amount of in-game currency, either 30k or 50k credits, where you seldom get 1k per match. While I really enjoy grinding for things in game, this just seems a tad excessive given there are other things you can spend your credits on. It just makes me feel like to get the most out of this game I have to invest actual money into it. It's just something that irks me but I totally understand why its in the game and its not a particularly terrible thin, considering the game is every bit as playable with 2 mercs as it is with 10.All in all, a great fps that is the right combination of competitive and fun.
