Although the multiplayer is sorta average and fells like many other multiplayer modes of other games, the campagin alone gives this game an 8/10 for me. I loved it and am now going to replay trying to find all collectibles and finish the permadeath game mode. I loved the combat, the music is beast, and the graphics and effects are insane. This is a great game and you should buy it and play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it.
I love this game. It is extremely addictive and had me racking up 80 odd hours in the first week of having it. Great game and have been following it since it was in early alpha. 10/10 would reccommed.
Wow. This game is a masterpiece. The art is beautiful and the subtle effects really emphasise the immersiveness of gameplay. The attentsion to animation also achieves the same. What made playing this game even more enjoyable was watching Double Fine Adventures, the documentry on the making of the game. Seeing the whole process of its development, the work put in by artists, programmers, producers, and others was awesome and especially enjoyable for someone such as myself wanting to enter the game industry. Please buy and watch it first before playing the majority of the game as it really increases your appreaciotion for not only this game, but the indie industry as a whole. The amount of hurdles and issues they overcame was impressive. As such, playing this game gave me an expirence unlike anything else I've played.Thank you Double Fine, Amazing game.
