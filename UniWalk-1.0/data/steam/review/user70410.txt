Honestly this game isn't that scary, just a bit eerie and full of jumpscares when you let your guard down. Anyways that's my opinion and experience, it is truely a good game for people who love that sort of stuff.
Orbital Gear is one of those games that take a couple of hours to get used to and when you do you feel like a pro... then you realise its 3 AM on a weekday and you've got a life to take care of. Soon after that train of thought you laugh and remember you don't have a life.
Great multiplayer game, if you have friends that play it as there isn't that many people who play online. The best thing about this game is how fast you can go, up to insane, inhumane speeds (I don't know who anyone could go over 1000 and not instantly get hit) but this is still a really good game and I highly recommend you buy it as long as you have the skills to play.
