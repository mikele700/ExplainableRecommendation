Really Fun Game, and fun learning how to play and trying to get good at the game. Awesome garage where you are able to customise your car and make it look as cool as you want.
I highly recommend this game. It is very enjoyable as it can be very realistic at times and the battle royale experience is amazing. It was like actually like playing  hunger games video game.
