I can happily recommend this game. Release hit expectations almost perfectly and can truly say I've had much pleasure playing this.Wonderful for a Strategy Zombie Survival.I'll certainly be paying close attention the DoubleBear for any games that make if all reach this level.----- Original Review -----I love this idea this game shows. Truely love it. I could spend so much time playing this game that I'd become a zombieHowever, the state the game is in, it isn't playable.I've followed this game for many months and when I could get my hands on it, I thought why not?Right now, it's just another list item in my steam library.Don't buy this until release date. Not early access.This game has VERY high goals, and they can be reached by DoubleBear.I'll edit this when I believe the game is in a better place.
