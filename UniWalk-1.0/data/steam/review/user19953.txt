why i loved the game in 10 points or less - seamless integration of cutscenes from activation points with no loss of it-'s beatiful graphics quality- something like 3 layers of attack type matchups for some involvement of strategy- incredibly beautiful environments and accompanying particle effects- flashy effects make for HYPEHYPEHYPE combos, of which there are tons to see- -loveable ragtag bunch of misfits- character trope, the interactions of which i enjoy seeing- the fighting mechanics are not too difficult to grasp and in fact, add an interesting level of complexity to gameplay- nothing like seeing POWPOWPOW numbers of damage and combos- OH GOD THE PUNS! it-'s almost PUN-ishing *wink wink @ Lailah* eeyyyyyy (it-'s not actually bad I LMAO-'d )- enemies spawn in consistent locations with decent spacing and dodging them is possible so you-'re not overwhelmed by their numbers and spawn/encounter rate ( yeah i-'m looking at you 1st gen pokemon you know what regions i-'m talking about)basically: very very pretty, very very POWPOWPOW  = grinning face emoji
Looking past the  framerate and technical issues, I-'ve actually quite enjoyed the events the game takes you to, lots of wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey stuff to mess around with timelines and really slap me across the brain with the ending. Loved it for the -SQUEENIX!!!- screamability. The Third-Party-Member-is-a-monster thing was also enjoyable for me as it brought out my inner pokemon trainer. I spent hours trying to tame and level up all sorts of cool monsters and complete my beastedex.7 -SQUEENIX!!!- screams out of 10
