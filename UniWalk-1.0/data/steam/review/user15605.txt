Its super meat boy for those with double vision. The start of the game leads you into a false sense of security thinking the game is easy but upon unlocking new worlds you will be punching your screen in frustration.I play this game with a controller as like super meat boy it just works better.I highly recommend this game. One of my favorites at the moment.
Great snooker game so far. There isnt much to the game in regards to a career mode or anything like that. Playing on the hardest difficulty doesnt pose much of a challenge as long as you get a good rythem going on your break. I have found however that the balls tend to do thier own thing sometimes which can be frustrating when you get to 140 on your break and play the perfect shot to finish on the black but the white ball will roll away suddenly. This has happened to me twice.For a game to pass some time i would highly recommend this but there are better billiards games out there.
