98%A better horror game than this doesn't exist, sorry
Aggressive
The definition of an -art game- or interactive story or whatever. Real short, real interesting, real pretty

95%Not perfect but as close as you're probably going to get CHRIST BUY IT
God is among us & he works at The Behemoth
Honestly this is probably the most well put together -Early Access- game I-'ve ever seen and Klei deserve every cent of your money for it. You won-'t run out of things to do, see and create; in a very broad sense Don-'t Starve is comparable to Minecraft on ketamine
