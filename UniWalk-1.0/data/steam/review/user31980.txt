Uhmmmm...10 potatoes/10 potatoes ?
Best chicken shooter simulator ever :)IGN Rated 10eggs/10eggs.
Top down one of the best game i-'ve ever played. Its simple and fun. You basically get to manage your own -Tactical SWAT Team-. From changing their names and avatars, to guns and equipments, the possibility is endless (thats a lie). But, I could easily find myself spending a couple of hours into the game. So if you-'re still pondering over the game.... JUST GET IT ALREADY! Trust mehUnless you absolutely hate strategy games :P
I really do like this game alot. Its simple and clean cut. It also simulates real life events via social media between you and a girl -Emily-. You control the relationship and how you want things to turn out. What i think it could improve on is the freedom of choice. Right now its alright, but I would love to have more choices. Anyways this game is awesome so definitedly go try it out :)
