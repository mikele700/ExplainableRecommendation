A lot of fun albeit repetitive. If you-'re looking to purchase additional warframes for plat, don-'t. It-'s far more economical to purchase plat during Steam sales or when you get 75% off during a login reward THEN buy the items you want from other players....or grind your butt off!Nearly everything is available for free however the catch is that you only have a certain number of slots to store your frames and weapons.You can save additional Platinum by getting items from alert missions. D/Ling the WF Alerts app is highly recommended.Also, Loki is amazing. Choose that frame after your tutorial.The Wikia is your Warframe bible. There is theorycrafting and optimal character building in this game and you-'ll find this reference highly valuable.Complete maps then do nightmare modes for rare dual-stat mods. Some are much easier than others and you can abort and restart if you get things like -no shields- opon starting the mission.Hit me up in-game!
