This isn-'t my first CoD game (I played 2 and 4 at LANs years ago), but it-'s my first that I-'ve bought. I-'ve clocked up 4.6 hours on it immediately after installing, and it-'s good. All the reviews bagging it are the same you always see- complaints about the -netcode- as though they know what the hell they-'re talking about (care to be more specific since you-'re all experts?), complaints that it-'s too similar to previous versions (it-'s a sequel, duh. It-'s meant to be the same game but upgraded and with a new storyline in the same genre), complaints about the differences being gimmicks (if they kept it the same, what then? They need these gimmicks, we want them, it sells games), and individual bugs that only some experience- I-'ve had none. But if you go through the review comments, you-'ll see that anyone who isn-'t having a cry is saying it-'s the best CoD yet. I-'ve read this MULTIPLE times on different sites. I-'ve played two hours singleplayer and 4.6 hours multiplayer without a break today. It-'s a good game! I had a good time! If you-'re sick of CoD, you wont like it because it-'s CoD, but if you want MORE CoD but with a different flavour, this is a fun and refreshing change to the franchise. Double jumps, futuristic perks and weapons, laser guns... what more do you want? Cyber dogs??
