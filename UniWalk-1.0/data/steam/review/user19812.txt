This game is geuinely great, and it gets better if you make the smallest purchase on the steam store. The community is massive and has its own trading currency built into it by the millions of fans out there. I love this game because the 9 classes are so balenced and well made, and any server you play on is fun no matter the map.10/10 -The True Savior
