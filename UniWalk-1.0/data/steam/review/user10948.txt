the game is decent, it is a bit of a rip off  but they pulled it off okay, everyone is saying it's laggy but that's only when its peak hour which makes sense, people need to play a bit more before making reviews
11/10, updates aint even fixing bugs and sound is way too ♥♥♥♥ing loud
uugh!.... right in the feels.
Great story, i loved it, i want the dlc now just for more
