Don't fix it if it ain't broke. That's the approach that ubi took and I'm glad they did. Free running is still aplenty and the frontier introduces a new environment to run in. Too bad the protagonist is always deadpan like Kristen Stewart.
Episode 1 of season 2 had me shocked, yelling and cringing. No doubt another awesome entry in the Walking Dead series by Telltale :)
Once you get pass all the technical problems, it is a great dungeon crawler! It is challenging and as the name suggests, prepare to die... a lot.
