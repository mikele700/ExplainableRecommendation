An absolutely amazing game!While a little glitchy at times the gameplay is unique, creative and incredibly fun.You may find yourself killing people while performing stunts, racing to get all the checkpoints, delivering the breifcase, or even jumping off buildings with friends and enemies alike in a falling battle!10/10 would recommend to every FPS fan and casual gamer.
