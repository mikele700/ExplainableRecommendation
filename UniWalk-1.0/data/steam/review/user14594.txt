For an early access game it's pretty decent. The textures, models and animations of this game is great, with weapons being animated in 200 fps. The weapons maps and perks are limited for now. There's only 3 maps, 4 perks, and a few weapons for each perk. Even so the game is enjoyable. Eventually there will be more maps, perks and weapons but for now they need to iron out the bugs first. For $30 the game might not be worth it for some people but I recommend playing this game. Especially with friends.
A great game for FPS fans. Detail in this game is really great and textures are pretty good for a game running on the Source engine.
