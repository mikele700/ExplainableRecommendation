I played this game during the free weekend so i had no problems with the amount of people online however i can see that being an issue.I never noticed a large amount of class imbalence like many people are saying, one change i could suggest is making your -ultiments- cooldown carry through death.And for people complaining about the graphics, you could have watched the trailer or looked at screen caps before you purchased it, no?
