This game, oh this game! In my opinion, it's better than the latest AvP. But, it has no shotgun!As the marine, there is one guy telling you what to do every now and then which I found annoying because I just wanted to have the same kinda experience the people had in the movies. The predator is good, but I found it annoying that marines can sometimes stilll see you when you have cloaked. This game is great and you should buy it, even if you have not seen any Alien movies! 9/10
THE HATS! SO MANY HATS! This is a team based FPS based in the 60's. There is a wide variety of weapons such as: The sandvich, Miniguns, flamethrowers and much more. You should get this game.
One of the best Star Wars games out there. I remeber playing this many years ago and it can be hard at some points (Like the final boss that bloody cheats) but it is still great. Good for anyone that likes Star Wars or that isnt a fan. 1313/10
Great game. I have not finished the game but I have watched friends and youtubers play it and it is epic!
This is fun and all but It is basically the same as the previous 2 games. I did like how there were new gadgets but they were very much like the gadgets from the previous games.
