Good For a free to play lots of weapons to choose from it's original and fun. It's not a pay to win gameyou can get the one of the best snipers in the game the SV98 without paying money. The players who paid don't have a great advantage over you if your good at FPS games you can easily beat them in a firefight or just snipe them from a distance. There are hackers on servers but just change server and stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing. The kills are satisfying it's an easy to learn game you can just log in and play. It's not a counter strike clone since when in counter strike can you hold 3 primary weapons and put scopes on them and modify them with silencers and other attachments and you cannot dual wield weapons in counter strike. This game has a nutshot kill no other FPS game i have played has that it's funny to shoot someone in the nuts. If you don't have good gear and can't compete with the players who paid just play on the noob servers or play a mode like fireteam were you all work together to win and not fight aganst each other.
