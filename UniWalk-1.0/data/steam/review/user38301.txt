This isn't just any tower defense game... (For an asking price of $25 you would hope not!) but THE tower defense game.If you enjoyed the origional Defense Grid, you will enjoy this.
Love it.Great story, fun gameplay even if the game is getting a little dated these days.Just a shame the sequels won't be on Steam anytime soon.
Still one of the best games of all time.Everyone should have it if they enjoy RTS games.
Good game, let down by a bad company, with horrible DRM, the forced use of uDontPlay doesn't help matters either.
