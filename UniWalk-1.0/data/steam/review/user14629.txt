Game is not as what the devs advertised it, this is merely 10% of what was promised
They changed it :(Wanted to see the dog jumpscare at front door, but NO... the dog jumps in now and killed meh :(
Game is currently -plagued- with bugs, *cant find any games*friends list doesnt work*steam intergation, joining friends games doesnt work*Server location keeps changing to other servers.*kept getting error 300..its currently a pain in the as to play,
Good DLC for the price , unless your a poor ♥♥♥ that gets dissappointed for $5 content,
Hands down one of the best game of 2015, lots of negative reviews here that doesnt make sense, most of them are stuck in the past kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s for morrowind and Fallout 3.
Game is a hot mess of disaster, April 12 Update was a promise of fix and new content, but its just a piece of sh*t update, made everything have high requirements and everything difficult, even the free DLC was impossible to make, even with 4 players above the required armor gear. game is garbage after april 12th
