Just a heads up to any and all who intend to play Warframe.I have had to battle my way through Paypal/Warframeto get a refund back because of lacking information on the forums to do with a product.It started with just a refund of ingame money, due to no reply for almost a month, i demanded a refund of real money back.Not going into details of what the case was.Paypal, have sided with me, after 14 business days saying my claims are valid and i have a right of refund.Warframes response was to suspend/Ban my account for 20 years, due to this.Just a massive warning to any and all who play this game, they show no compassion nor do they care for your rights as a person. Yes the game is free great, but all they want is your money, the second you ask for a refund due to a real reason, they will bite you in the butt and throw you under the bus.Share this so people are aware, free to play really is not all that great, and warframe have shown that.Due to legal rights at this point in time, i'm unable to show the conversations i've had between paypal and the warframes support until the case is completed.
