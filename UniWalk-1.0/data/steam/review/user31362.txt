This game is such a success. What Valve aimed for, they have achieved. Following the story of Chell, a test subject in Aperture Science, you are guided through puzzle chambers with only a robotic female voice ( I don't want to give spoilers ), your trusty Portal gun, and your wits. But something seems amiss in the centre, as you soon find out. A great experience, challenging puzzles and an immersive story. A must-buy.
