Awesome game and to me feels just like a 2D version of Binding Of Izaac which is a great game as well as this one.
Lol, Goat Simulator the best most realistic simulator out there. Lol not really this game is made purely for the lols and is nothing like a life of a goat, this in my opinnion is one of the best games of 2014.
Great game so many possible combination's of what the game you make could be very fun and just a great game.
Broforce is great game and is so much fun in multiplayer, what makes this game special is that everytime you respawn, you respawn as a different character.
Good game I really love this game because when you get an item you don't just get the item but it accually appears on your character.
This game is still in early beta but it is so much fun espicially with friends and is a hole lot better than Terraria.
Very creative sand box, briliant game.
Very fun and amazing, this game can make you think it's all about strategy for this game but really fun when you've taken over the world.
