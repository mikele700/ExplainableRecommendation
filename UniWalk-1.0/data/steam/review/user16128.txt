Day one DLC? bad NO thats something id expect from EAEnemy hitboxes stop working past 150m SERIOUS ISSUEMultiplayer is unplayable, compareable to watchdogs on launchdayCo-Op is also broken, second player that is connected to the host will fire 2-4 times for every single click of the mouse on their end.The AI is FAR from groundbreaking like the devs would like you to believe, unless ground breaking is spotting you and calling for help while being stabbed in the jugular and also seeing you at 100+ meters while you are prone and in a bushOnly improvements from SE2 is prettier looking graphics probably the only posative thing i can come up withDefinatly regret buying it, will update with more issues/praise as i progress into the game
DLC locked multiplayer, game tends to randomly generate you ontop of traps killing you instantly, is a pixel game but lags for no reason after the boss body despawns? needs massive amount of grinding to get anywhere, and once you get a good run you tend to die
