I love this game so much! One of my all time favourites but if your planning on buying the NW DLC, the community is toxic, be warned & stay away from that, Buy the game it's amazing!
We set out to hunt down the Nazi as a riflemen I bob my head up and insantly sniped, my friend runs in to clear the building and lives to kill the sniper. I walk in and instantly hit by a bazooka 10/10
10/10 would drop the soap again
