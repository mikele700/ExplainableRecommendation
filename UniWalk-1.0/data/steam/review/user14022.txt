NOT P2W? SKILL-BASED? ♥♥♥♥♥♥S? What more can you ask from a game.
Made a game with a legit name and age rating, -Ninja-'s Blade- rated M, got 3 million dollars profit. Made a game for young kids named -FIST ME DADDY!- Got 500 million dollars profit and 10/10 reviews.10/10 Game, Would shout and confuse my dad again
Great Game, Very Fun and challenging, Even funner with friends, but this game Requires A Lot Of Space.
This game is not as cool as it looks. Get Starbound instead, this game is still early access and is a lot harder than starbound and terraria, I won't recomend this until it has improved, better world generating is needed and it is not r than terraria or starbound until it has improved, I really Regret buying this game. (wasted $20)
