Don-'t get me wrong, its an amazing game and i love it when you can actually walk around when there are no hackers.I have only 17 hours on the game and my friend and i have been raided over 10 times by hackers. now i know people will say -oh but you are still new to the game they werent hacking-. well thats where you-'re wrong. Reign Of Kings doesnt have an option where you can sprint across the entire map in a few seconds and teleport through stone walls, therefore allowing the person to take all of your hard earned items. I am actually infuriated by the hackers. They take all of the fun outof the game and crush your experiance of the game. If the game could look at the reports you put on players. I payed $19.99USD for this game, and i use AUD so i payed an extra $6.65 to be greeted by hackers.
this is a mind ♥♥♥♥ game but a verry fun and long lasting game i recomend it to players who have some free time on there hands
you may rage...
