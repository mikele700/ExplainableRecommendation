I enjoyed playing this game. It's a lot of fun in my opinion, although the story aspect of it doesn't really go anywhere.It did however endear me to the playable characters, I would actually love it they appeared again in resident evil canon, they are quirky if a bit sadistic and apathetic. That also goes for the spec op team as well, I found them to be quite likeable. It's the little in-game dialogue that really endears them to me.I've finished both the original and spec ops story lines and am still playing this game, the only pity is the fact that the online multiplayer is quite dead and unless you have a lot of friends with this game won't be able to enjoy.
