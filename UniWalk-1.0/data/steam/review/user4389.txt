This game has gotten worse each update. The new weapons are nice but there is no tech tree, no RP. The whole game is now based around luck and how good your team is. You can do the very best and get the very best crate only to find a lump of dirt inside. You are not rewarded fairly and I think that you should make a seperate version of the game or update it back to the good old days. This is a fun game and worth playing but it can be and was alot better.
