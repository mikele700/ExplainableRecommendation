I'm too scared to log off incase my house gets raided.10/10 would leave game on 24/7 again  Great community, never kill on sight, always helpfull, easy for begginers, Great XP System All thats not true, but thats what makes it fun, Still hope they bring back the blueprints system but XP isn't as bad a people say.
