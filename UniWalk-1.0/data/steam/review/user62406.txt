Dude this is soo good it is gonna be even better when they add cars planes and hellis aswell as more guns!
This is possibly one of my favorite early access single player survival games this year. The gameplay is smooth good mechanics and the animal life are all really good and i cant wait to see the multiplayer.*7.9*
