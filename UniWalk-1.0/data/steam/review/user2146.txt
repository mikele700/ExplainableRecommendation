This game could have been so much more then it was..started of well and then it basically ended, I did like the story but just not enough gameplay :(..I finished the game in 1.9hours....$10 wtf?
I FULLY LOVE THIS GAME!! Few bugs here and there but it to be expected, just hit f8 in game and report it to the dev's too easy!!This game would be so good if it was 4 player co-op with objectives and lots more enviromental dangers..I'll still play it if they go the MMO option tho.BRING ON MORE UPDATES :)...GREAT EARLY ACCESS GAME!!
This game is very enjoyable!! I like the level up system and the crafting of weapons and how you must unlock them all first. Katana play is interesting, makes it hard to survive if they get close to you.I play mostly -Titan- mode, altho TDM is good its just refreshing to have a little change :)...I-'m yet to try the -Horde- mode but looks fun.Its a little buggy but its just come of early access so its excepted..with regular updates and improvements I can see lots of people adding it to their gaming collection. Its worth getting!!
I like the 4 player co-op...good menu setup and upgrade features, looking forward to some Australia servers (hopefully).overall = Fun co-op shooter.
I havent put this many hours into a game for a long time, recommend this game, it has so much going for it!!
Great game, if you love co-op then this is must...loads of fun!!
