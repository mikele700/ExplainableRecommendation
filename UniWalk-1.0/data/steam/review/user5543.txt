It was difficult at first but after a while it gets quite easy to use after you learn the basics and practice, at first i was also struggling but through inspiration, determination and practice, i was able to learn SFM. I rate SFM 9/10. Why?, Possibilities are endless just about in SFM, Load custom maps or even make your own through scenebuilding, Can be used to make some pretty cool SFM animations and posters. only downside i could think of is it crashing sometimes but other than that, its really awesome.

I've only played for about 7 hours but im not gonna lie to you...Once you start playing, You dont want to stop.
Terraria is a great game.I play Terraria because its simple, Unique and fun to play.This game is GOTY in my books.
Half life 2 is a great game and a great sequel to the original Half life.There are certain parts where you might have to do a puzzle or even play fetch with a giant Robotic beast.Overall i rate this game 10/10
