why the ♥♥♥♥ did they add and island if you cant even swim without all ur gear teleporting to the bottom of the ocean where u cant get it? Pure genius. Bohemia interactive should be barred by law preventing them from developing any more dissapointments they call games. They have the ideas but cannot bring them to life without ♥♥♥♥ing it up. you would think that in 3 years they can optimize the game but no i have to go in the game files and do it myself they would rather add guns that dont even spawn thanks to the bugs they leave in. They add vehicles but why would i need that when i can lag slide across the map? not to mention when i did get in a vehicle it got bugged into a rock and killed me. 10/10 would never buy any more dissapointments of Bohemia interactive again.
used to be amazing combat was fluid movement felt smooth but now they have completely ♥♥♥♥ed everything that used to make this game so good. Comabt feels rough and zombie hitboxes are ♥♥♥♥ed aswell everythings ♥♥♥♥ed bring back the old 7 days to die
