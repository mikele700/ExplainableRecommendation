BULL ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥
-Nerdcubed THE BEST GAME EVER- <---------- Isn-'t true in your opinion it-'s the best game ever but in others it-'s not.Let me clarify I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE this game (My Opinion) it-'s better than JC2 and 1Pros:Hmm, ♥♥♥♥ING EXPLOSIONS 4 DAYS-Good story- AKA  So Rico comes to medici does some ♥♥♥♥ then gets wingsuit and cooler grapple, you blow alot of stuff up, uh then some person called Dimah dies and Di Ravello dies THE END. WAIT I forgot something EXPLOSIONS ALOT OF THEM Fun mechanics (Flying around blowing ♥♥♥♥ up and shooting things)Cons:♥♥♥♥♥♥ StoryPhysics are WTFAlot of gimics  ALOT You need to put alot of time in to unlock anythingAlso Avalanche Blowing up a ton of stuff in a Military Base/Town/Airfield isn-'t -liberating- it!But to sum it up I give i a 7.8/10 (Pick it up in a sale or somethin-')Thanks for reading my review pleasecheck out some others of mine.
