Ignore the people crying about balance, it's fine. They just sour about stealth being made balanced instead of insanely overpowered. Althought some bugs do need fixing, it's a great game that deserves more praise then it gets.10/10 would get jumpkicked through a wall again.
This is, by far, the best First Person Shooter to come out in the last decade. It's a glorious, bloody, violent tribute to all that the original DOOM great. A thumping industrial heavy metal soundtrack that demands that you headbang as you slaughter demons in the hundreds. A hellish version of Mars that is bright where required, dark and forboding when needed, and never dull and lifeless in its tone.And the everpresent feeling that, no matter how bad the odds look, no matter what the game throws at you, you will overcome. You will survive. You will win.Rip and tear, son. This is the start of a new age where DooM has claimed its rightful place on the throne of shooters.(Also, the MP is aight/10. But who cares?)
