In 45 minutes you are dying of thirst and starving. About to pass out. It's like being Paris Hilton in a zombie apocalypse which is a game that I dared to dream of but never thought would be realized. 5 stars. Would hit it again. Shigeru Miyamoto has managed to hit hit all the high notes and then some with this summer scorcher.
100% GOTY. First you are an astronaut,then you are a frogman then you drive a tank. It's really refreshing and original. I was running around shooting people, next minute I was on a helicopter with a minigun. But you have to watch it because they get really hot and you are not allowed to shoot anymore. So I took it easy. There is a bar which gets all red and shows you how hot it is getting. I generally let it get like 75% of the way and then I stop for a bit. It's a pain but it's pretty much realistic. I talked to a soldier once at Someplace Else in the city and he confirmed that you can't shoot a real gun forever, which is pretty much what I had expected. Kudos to Infinity Ward for taking the high road on that one. Anything less would be an insult to the real operators that keep us safe in our beds at night time. But I did not like the ♥♥♥♥ing dog. I am not an alsatian fan . They are an oily dog and the smell gets on everything (especially couches).
From what I can gather, it's almost exactly like being in the real army as a proper soldier. Even guys that are actually real soldiers are saying this on the internet in forums and what have you. I guess they do this when they get back from a patrol or something and then start playing ARMA 3 and they're like 'hang on,this is supposed to be my layabout time, why am I putting myself through all of this again? And on my own dime to boot!' Anyway, Infinity Ward have created another scorcher with this one.
