Bad frame rate issues. Glitches. Not starting. Lack of depth. No multiplayer. Ps2 tier graphics. An ending that is actually a beginning. Hello Games you failed. You promised something and you did not deliver that promise. Myself and millions of others bought your game on many different premises that simply weren't in the game. And up until months before release were still being shown in trailers. And absolute joke. Now im stuck with it.
