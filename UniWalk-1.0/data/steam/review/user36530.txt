This game has an independant loader and makes it difficult to load, you have to create a seperate account then it won-'t run. I Kept getting a -LaunchPad was unable to connect.- error and hen i went to the site provided by them the help was unable to assist with the problem. I had to wade through the material they had on file and still could not find an answer to the problem. I then tried to log a ticket with Sony and the account I had just made was invaild and I was reqquired to make another avvount with Sony to log a error and ask for some help. Not to self and a warning to all stay away from Sony online games. they just screw you over and waste your time.
This game has an excelent story line and beautiful character development. An excelent choice.
Don't bother with this game it has a eliteist community that doesn't take the time to help out new players. its simply a pay to win game. NOT WORTH THE TIME TO PLAY AND LEARN
Very cool, able to leave it running in the background and it basically plays itself.
