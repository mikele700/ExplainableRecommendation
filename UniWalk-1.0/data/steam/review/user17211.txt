Pizza is awesome.... 10/10!
Call of Duty - Black Ops II is one of the best games I have played in the Call of Duty Series, Only problem is that you can-'t play private matches (to play with bots) or even play zombies solo without being connected to the internet. Although it is a very great game which I recommend being played, It is still a problem for people who travel alot and want to play some -Combat Training- or Have Carnage with some zombies without having internet.
