love it, its basically tf2 but batman themed
desguising FTW!
fun challenging puzzler
one of my best games
EPIC minor glitch/bugs but apart from that it's a addicting game
it's a great game! but it does have it's bad moments; crashes, unfair deaths, losing saves ect. but in the end it's worth the cost for this great game!
