I used to play this with my mates all the time, so when this came back to Steam, and for under a fiver, I jumped at the chance, I hadn't played the PC version before, it's pretty much identicle, maybe a bit sharper, but sadly lacking any sort of multiplayer.The writing is fun, it was a huge draw getting the entire cast back to lend vocal talents (yes, Murray sounds a bit board at times), it makes me wonder why Ghostbusters 3 has been such a chore to get started when thay basically have the frame work here.My son loves it, I love it - who ya gonna call?
As addictive as the drugs that get smuggled into my prisons.For an alpha game its in amazing shape, i've had no real issues with bugs, and when I have, its just a matter of reloading, so nothing serious.The regular updates are exciting, as of this review, the next update (22) will be a huge bug hunt.Grab it, if you have time to spare, cause it will steal hours from you quicker then a life sentence.
It's a great game, even after all these years.But it's a shame we have to live with the low violence version, now that Australia has an R rating.I know we can't rate games again, but at the very least, allow us to patch the game to how it should be.The lack of blood and gore, although not critical to the game, has an impact on the games atmosphere.Either way, it's a blast, grab it.
A simply stunning game. Seven years in the making and it shows, the tech used to bring the characters to life in amazing, advanced enough that havving to read peoples faces and body language isnt just a crap shoot, it gives you enough information to make an informed decision.It's not GTA, but it never tries to be, if you love the slow burn of 40's dectective novels and films, then this is the perfect game for you.Make sure you grab the DLC as well, you won't be dissapointed.
