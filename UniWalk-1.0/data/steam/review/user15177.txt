This is an amazing game but it needs a bucketload more raiders attacking Sanctuary hopefully that comes in the dlc .On that note though  i have put alot of my life into this game amazing graphics for the size  lol i give it a 8.8 raccoons out of 10 raccoons
So far an amzing indie game but when is release lol
Very Nice game nearly as nice as bacon
anything with dinosaurs and guns is AWESOME
Umm.. Just Plain Um...
What an amazing i do not no what the ♥♥♥♥ im doing but .......IT's Grass simulator so 10/10 raccoons from me
