Let it be known that even though the port might be pretty bad, the game in itself is great. This WAS a PSP game after all and I-'m pretty happy to have gotten the opportunity to play the game on PC than not at all since I don-'t own a PS4 or a PSP/Vita. The game works perfectly fine for me a runs on a consistant 30fps where some of my friends have told me that they experienced some fps drops on PS4. Although if you don-'t have monitors that support a 16:9 ratio I-'d wait until they patch in all the other resolutions like they did for the 13 series. And to address the framerate issue - just like 13 and 13-2 anti-aliasing is another fancy term for downsampling and setting it on -Highest- would make your internal resolution render at 4k. So unless you-'re running on a crazy setup I-'d turn that option down to -Normal- or turn it off completely to have an enjoyable experience.Also, Sice is bae and if you dodge roll you can have a nice glimpse of the girls-' panties 10/10.
