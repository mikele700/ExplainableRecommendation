Do NOT buy this game. That is unless you feel like playing at an absolutely terrible frame rate.I've got a really decent gaming rig, i7 3770k @ 4.5 ghz, 16 gb ram, 980 TI and I was lucky to get 40 fps in this piece of ♥♥♥♥. It wasn't even stable at 40 fps and often dropped below that. Are you kidding me? Don't tell me it's because it's such an intenstive game, it's just an absolutely garbage port. I even tried changing the resolution to 640x480 down from 2560x1440 and guess what? still 40 fps outside.The absolutely WORST port i've played in years. do NOT buy this piece of ♥♥♥♥. I got it for $15 off of green man gaming and oh do I regret it.
