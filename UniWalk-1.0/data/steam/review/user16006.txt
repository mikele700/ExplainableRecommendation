YES YES YES!This game is utterly amazing! For a free to play MMOARPG(Massive Multiplayer Online Action Role Playing Game) this game is by far the best in my opinion! Gameplay that keeps you wanting to do more dungeons and sailing around the 'Hub World'  building your own Cornerstone house to show off to others!?This game is hands down one of the best out there in terms of FTP!
Far Cry 3 is by far right now one of my favourite FPS's and I think it always will be. Good bullet physics, stealth and studying movement patterns to see where the pirate will move to across the camp to become an advantage in staging your all-out assault or a stealth take. Sniping the men who are following you because you blew up their convoy of jeeps. And let's not forget to mention. Those graphics on the explosions are the best I've seen of every game that has chaos in it. Not only is their one huge island full of mysterious temples and WWII ruins, but also a second large island and a completely separate island for the co-op mode. And of what I've played, multiplayer is also great fun.
