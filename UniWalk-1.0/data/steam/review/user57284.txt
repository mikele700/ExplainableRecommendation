I love this game especially the combat and stealth, love the upgrades and skills, graphics and sounds! The only problem i've encountered is that im on the Gondola Transport mission and when the Gondola stops i can't make the rope :/ i can't progress past this and it's really annoying me but i can't seem to find anyone else who has this issue, i'll find a way to fix it and continue loving this game, i would recommend this to anyone who has a brain ;)
