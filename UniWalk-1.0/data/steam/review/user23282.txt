This game might seem childish but it really isn't! It's one of my fave games and I'd recommend it to anyone. It's a great game to play with your friends (you'd be suprised but it is really fun to watch your friends yell when you don't get them together) I enjoy this game a lot and even when I saw it I thought it would be very childish but look at the names of the resturants (There's one called Jerk King and Tai Me up) You might want to try it out, it's a good fun little game!
Emily is Away is witty and I enjoy the game a lot. The game is short but you can replay it and try different things (like one time being all nice or being a total jerk) The icons you can choose are cute and some of the things you can say to Emily are really cool. The ending might make you regret playing it, which thats what happened to me but it's still a fun game!
