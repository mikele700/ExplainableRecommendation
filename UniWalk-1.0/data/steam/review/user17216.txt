I'm absolutely, positively, mind ♥♥♥♥ingly, abnormally, prepostorously, uncomprehendably bad at this game. I honestly don't know what I was thinking when I bought this. Maybe that I would somehow gain skills to be good at an FPS whilst it downloaded. Or maybe that I would some day run the game and instantly be good at it, I don't know, but one thing hasn't changed... and that is the fact that I am so insanely bad at this game that there should be a whole other rank just for me. It'd be called Cancer master because that's how attrociously bad I am............... but I'm still gonna play a couple matches before I do my homework.....
