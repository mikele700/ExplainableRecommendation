A darn, hard, frustrating, awesome, zombie survival, realistic, open world MP which has so much things to do and taking care of your character AND making friends and kill anyone you see. DO NOT TRUST ANYONE, only trust your friends.10/10P.S I forgot to say this game is beutiful

Best characters, awesome missions, best story but AC4 was better, but this game is still the best in 2010.9/10
This game is really fun and you need the skill to play this game, I am bad, but it is fun9/10 awesome shooter and you MUST own this game if anyone sees this.
After getting the first episode of Life is Strange I didn't know what to expect. After finishing the first episode I wanted to play the other episodes and see how it ends. This game does have the Walking Dead dialogue feel, but I mainly enjoyed the Story itself, the Art style the game offered and I do commend the Graphics and the Music, but I will mainly commend the Story and Characters. You will not regret buying this game, it is nice and once you finish the first season of this game you will feel like wanting a second season. I cannot wait for a second game to play9/10
