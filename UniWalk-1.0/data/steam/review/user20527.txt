This game its one of the best games i ever played ,so being by having something that not all the other FPS's have ,what i mean about that is the feeling that I get when I kill somebody ,the high tension thats created around that moment is pricesless .But i have to say that the game is focused around team play and I saw that you get a better experience if you help the team to get more objectives then having an wounderfull 42-0 score .So if your looking for a smoth FPS this game is the choise , doesnt matter if your a casual player or a hardcore one you'l enjoy this game .
