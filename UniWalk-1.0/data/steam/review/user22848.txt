CSGO is the game that will bring the worst out of you but dam is it fun when you get good like when you finally get that ninja defuse after thousands of attempts and your team goes wild or when it 1v5 bomb planted and you kill them all and defuse the bomb CS:GO is one of the best fps out there way better then any old battlefield or cod and with it regually updates it will keep you busy for a long time, The community server will keep you busy aswell from surf to minigames to deathmatchs to practice you can't get bored with this much content in one little package also did i mention that you can make money off csgo from trading weapons and making profit, betting, jackpots, and cases but cases may be the quickest and easyest way they are rigged and will f uck over some people but you may get lucky and make $400 from just one case and a key.Bad NewsCompetive bans feel like their out to get you when you internet just is too bad to connect to a server and it give you a 7day for not joining this also makes you want muilt-accounts which means more smurfing,Smurfing is also another issue with csgo but if you can use them to your advaentage so learning how they play and spots higher player use will help but does ruin the game when vsing one.and remeber to watch plenty of youtuber for best strats and spray pattern practice.9/10 good but could be bettersee you guys out on the field
