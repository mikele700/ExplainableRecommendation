Legit lost my job and girlfriend to this game, after playing 210 hours of it in 2 weeks.Damn Altis Life, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'s addicting.
Fairly certain my girlfriend is going to leave me because of this game, and how much money I don't seem to have because of it.

When the game isn't crashing, it is stuttering worse than an autistic kid watching sonic.Also, instead of fixing said issues, they went full EA and added microtransactions.1/10, and only cos you can slide up stairs, do not buy.
