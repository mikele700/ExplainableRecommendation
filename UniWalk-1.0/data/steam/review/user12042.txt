One of my all time favorite games I used to play this years ago and when I saw it on steam I HAD to get it amazing chaotic strategic fun If you loved worms or OpenLieroX as a kid this is the game for you.
While the actual combat animations are not suberb there is no weight to any swings nor wump to any arrows etc the world is superbly detailed and the sheer possibility for stories is insane this game is really what you make of it. Oh and I havent even mentioned the modding community.
Horrible horrible Game DO NOT BUY
