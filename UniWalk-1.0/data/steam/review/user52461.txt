It is quite a difficult game to initially grasp. The store/shop and the secret store/shops are really quite aan interesting touch that, until you get used to the game, are quite annoying. The concept of donkeys bringing you gear is really nice, it enables you to stay in lane longer then most other MOBAs which is good. I didn-'t particularly enjoy having to buy town scrolls to teleport to my base, I-'d rather press b, wait, and bam, home. But I guess it makes DotA 2 stand out. My CS game is particularly good in pretty much every MOBA from League of Legends to Smite, to Awesomenauts, to Super Monday Night Combat, and in these games, if you don-'t cs all to well or even don-'t get kills, as long as you don-'t die it-'s possible to stay in the game. Whereas DotA gold collecting automatically takes a some time and CSing/last hitting minions is quite hard but gets you around 50 gold which is really a pain as if you don-'t cs or get kills you fall behind everyone else. Most shop items are rather expensive and that is purely based on the knowledge I have from other MOBAs, I would consder myself a pretty good MOBA player, but I don-'t know what it is about DotA 2 that I find myself not doing as much damage as the other guy, as a character that -looks- like a carry/ranged carry. It takes some time to get used to, and it takes some time, a long time, to understand each characters ability set and know how to play around it.I-'d give this game 7/10, would recommend
Waste your life on this game. Do it. And buy me Sandstorm DLC. tyty.
