Incredible.One of the best games ever created.Recommendations For Gameplay:- Turn Subtitles Off- Play on second most difficulty
From playing for almost 4 hours and openning up more of the gameplay, it's incredible.Good fun, refreshingly new systems in play, combat's good once you get the hang of it.Having so many characters to manage is a bit overwhelming since I don't really care about any of them, but i'm sure that'll come soon.Only negative reviews are from stupid people expecting a next gen Final Fantasy.It runs fun with whatever fps lock there is apparently on there.Looks great too, apart from a few things where you just question what the hell happened, overall it looks good enough.This is a $30 Final Fantasy title with great gameplay and story.What more do you want?(FFXV obviously :P)
So it seems from my few moments of play (post smashing through Storm 3), that they have created whole new anime scenes and background lore for the Naruto storylines.High quality animation and anime cutscenes seperate the main fights while providing a never before seen storyline/back story to the Naruto narrative.Fighting/mechanics are very similar to Storm 3, with a few things seeming smoother.Nice addition to the franchise but could be regarded as a massive DLC realistically.The extra storylines portrayed via anime is incredible as I-'ve followed Naruto from the begginning and a game hasn-'t shown something that-'s not been in the anime before (nothing major anyways).The first -'story-' mission is -The beginning of the Akutsuki- which is basically the origins story of them.good fun.am drunk.
