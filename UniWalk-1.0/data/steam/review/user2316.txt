Best life simulator I've ever played. Learnt 2 more languages through here Tagalog and Russian. Prepares me for all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I'll ever face irl. 10/10 would pick Meepo again. Rates this 7/ 8 mangoes
The community is ♥♥♥♥. Its difficult to set up a server. But other than that the game play is fine.I'll give it a rating of 4 out of 10 potatoes
