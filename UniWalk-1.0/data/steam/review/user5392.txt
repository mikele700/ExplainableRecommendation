Too often have I seen an amazing game swept under the rug. I thought I experienced top-of-the-line gaming when I played amazing games such as Farming Simulator, but I-'ve been bested. With an emotional story line, Bad Rats allows you to play with amazing features such as archery, realistic physics and perfect video settings. I often get sucked into the amazing gameplay. It-'s an enthralling game which needs to be given more love. With realistic and heart-wrenching character development, you truly begin to understand life as one of the -Bad Rats-.
