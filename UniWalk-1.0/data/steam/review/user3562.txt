Its a really fun shooter tha can be great by yourself or playing with friends. Multiplayer can really require alot of teamwork or the heist won't come together. The skill tree is great as it allows you to go down specific routes for example stealth ghosts, tecnicians and other important components to bring a team together.Overall I really enjoyed playing this with my friends and steam companians
