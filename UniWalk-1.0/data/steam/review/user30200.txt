Yes. Just, yes. Why are you still reading this? You could be playing this awesome game!
On my fourth play through at the moment looking for some elusive achievements along with just plain enjoying it still. I loved the story and characters, the constant reading of text can get rather tedious especially in longer cut scenes but after the first play through I remember what they say anyway so I just hold down skip. Arts and orbments were a little confusing at first but you get the hang of them quickly enough. Battle can be rather repetitive after a while, luckily after levelling up a bit you get certain attacks that can decimate large groups of enemies (Black Fang, Howling Bullet, etc) but you need CP charged up but that doesn't take too long. Basically, if you are a fan of the genre, or looking to get into the genre, you should love this game. I simply cannot wait for Second Chapter to come out.
Great game. Little annoying getting the hang of fighting and what to do on occasion but still definitely worth a play.
Gripping once you get attached to Elodie and then make a choice that gets her killed.
Simply awesome. Brilliantly fun to play with friends or even with randoms.
It's fun to make cars blow buildings up.
