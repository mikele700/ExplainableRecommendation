OMG THE BEST STEALTH GAME EVA! GREAT GRAPHICS AND SHADOWS! AWESOME GAMEPLAY! (Very satisfying when you just slit, stab or knock out a Nazi) I love -Stealth Games- and by far this is one of the best I have played! plus you don-'t even need a super duper computer to run it, I am running in a Macbook Air and still its in satisfactory conditions! The enviroment is good and looks like a real WW11 enviroment to play in! Definately a underrated game! I wish people played it more! and if you are also like a stratigic game where you have to choose wisely, this is also a really good game for you! Its like hitman but in ww11 era and your a woman :D Worth getting the game there is alot of discounts I think!
Ma god, Ma god, Ma god. If Jebus Christ was in WWII with guns and violence and then turned into a game.... It will create this game. 9/10 IGN - It's aight
