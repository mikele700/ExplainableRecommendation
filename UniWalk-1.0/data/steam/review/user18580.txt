People are overeacting to this game. Sure it's one of the best Local Multiplayer games out there (one of the best multiplayer experiences I've had), but it's not worth it's price. I thought this game would have more content but it's definitely not worth it's base price $15, or $10, or barely even $5 for that matter. I expected the singleplayer mode to have way more in it and they should really mention that it's not worth it at all. It's definitely one of the most frustrating things I've played. It's more like a challenge mode, revealling bits of background story but it's just gameplay. If you get this game, you get it for the fun couch-deathmatches. That's the main purpose of this game. The trials and singleplayer is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It should be replaced with a practice mode. And bring some friends and controlllers. Four of them. It's the only way to play multiplayer/properly. Keyboard sucks and eventually hurts after a while. I definitely DO NOT recommend unless it's on sale.
I love this game but I bought it once because $6.80 is probably the lowest price it'll ever be. I buy it this time, EA, but i'm pirating everything else.
God damn I hate source engine games. Why couldn't we just connect to a friend instead of having to open ports or opening hamachi?
How can I trade this in for 'The Culling'?
Intergalatic exploration with one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. 9/10
