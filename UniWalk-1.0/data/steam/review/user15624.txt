This game is insane, one of my favourite shooters too this date. Can't believe how cheap this is for what it is. Well worth a buy!
One of my all time favourite shooters dated back to 2007 this game brought me many hours of gameplay through PS3 to now PC, if you're looking for a shooter which is made for competative multiplayer then give this one a go, keep the Australian servers going!
