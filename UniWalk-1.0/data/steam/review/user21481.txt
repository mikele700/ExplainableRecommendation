great game, still is holding up in the graphics department since 2010. best played with a friend who screams at everything and over all leveling to max level is satisfying.
watch your corners get you duffal bag and a bat because your going to need everything you see to survive in this apocoliptic future. Zombies rain and humanity has fallen, the few survivors left are split and with zombies drawn to any loud noises helicopters gunshots and the very annoying house alarm are just some of your problems that just are waiting to explode in you face. this game isnt about finding a cure or killing all of the zombies on earth its about your survival and inevitable your demise.Good luck survivor's.
essentualy this game is LIKE terraria BUT it has a lot of differences making it scary and amazingly fun to play. For the scary part try having a massive cute furry creature that looks harmless  jump at your face and one hit you because usually the passive mobs actually are the scaryiest looking tenticale goops of goop that you've see. another side note this games construction make you both sad and crazy for all the right reasons, 1 you're going to make the coolest looking base then T_T ditch it to make and even cooler one in a new sector. 2 if you're the type to get agressive really fast don't try to tank mobs because death in this game is like paintball if you're hit your back to the start to try all over again. have fun.
