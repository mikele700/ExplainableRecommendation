Fantastic game, and one of the first games I've encountered where you see the side of war from the civilians point of view. It's emotive, tough and makes you feel desperate to retrieve and steal items your people need to get through. I cannot recommend it enough. If you're looking for something that challenges you emotionally and strategically this is the game for you.
I was absolutely obsessed with this game back in 2014, I loved the feeling of constant anxeity of hearing another player (or radioactive wolves and bears) coming up behind you whilst you gathered resources or waited out the night in you rickety little wooden shack. Then for some reason I just stopped playing.Last night was my first play through since then and I was absolutely amazed by how things changed.I LOVE the inventory system, it's so simplistic and a lot easier to manageAnd the building system is another feature that has taken the simplistic road making it a lot less of a headache and a lot easier to build quickly under pressure of other players in the area.Also the maps a beautiful, filled with colour and sound, the only thing is (maybe it was just the server I was on) I struggled to find any deer or boars (but that's not a fault of the game and was just possibly the server I was on)I would definately re-recommend this to previous Rust enthusiasts, I'm glad after months of debating whether to get back into it or not that I did. So much work has been done (as opposed to other early access games I've been playing) and you can tell developers are moulding this into a top contender of the mulitplayer survival genre
