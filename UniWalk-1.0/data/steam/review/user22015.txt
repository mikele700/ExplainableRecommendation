This is the greatest game I have every played and I think that everybirdie should play it. It combines the enjoyment, complexity and reality of a high school girl trying to find a boyfriend and my extraordinary love for pigeons. My only criticism of this game is that the game is not long enough in order to truly connect with its characters and feel like I had a true and real relationship with the pigeons in the story.
