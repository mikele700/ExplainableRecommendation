Before i say anything i havent been playing this game on steam very much i have only really played it before it came out on steam.I would also like to thank trion for destroying my most loved mmo, and maybe even game.I have logged countless hours into this game with my friend and now they are adding too much.The thing i cant stand right now is the paid classes aspect.Before i would spend hours on end to get that one extra class.Now i have never put my money in to a game, and i dont plan on starting now.why trion?just why?
Great game that has physics that really affect your robot in battle though if youre not willing to buy from the robo shop or you cant build then in high teirs youre going to die. ALOT!!!!
The single most stressful game I have ever played! But awesome!
