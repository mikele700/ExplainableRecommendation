This is definitely a good game. Just like real battleships and is perfect for blowing the ♥♥♥♥ out of other people, sending them sky-high!
AI cars in this are ♥♥♥♥ing stupid but funny at times. I am definitely a fan of the Mercedes Actros. 8.5/10!
This game is probably one of the best free to play games I've encountered. Seems like a mix of Skate 3, Qwop and Goat Simulator. Could do with some more clothing and some slight bugfixes but other than that, I hope it stays a free to play.
This game is so much fun! recently given to me by a friend after becoming interested in it when playing with him on dual splitscreen. Definitely recommended
