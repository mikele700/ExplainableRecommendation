The game looked great and the reviews said it was... wrong! The idea is absolutely amazing, but is gone horribly bad. The thing is that when you try to play you just don't find servers or people who to play with and you have to play with the bots, which is pretty anoying. Now, the free2play version (the not premium one) acts almost like a demo, you have to purchase the premium version becuase if not, you can't do almost anything to your tank. And side note, I play with an xbox controller, and the sensitivity of the joystick is f**cked up! I barely touch it and the turrent stars to spin crazy-fast.In short Words: Very cool idea, but horribly bad game.
