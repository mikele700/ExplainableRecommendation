Severs for Straya!10/10
fug a blurg yeah this game is ok.... isn't it?
addicting...
Love it. So relaxing. I mean, who wouldn't want to play a game about a ninja trying to destroy the evil red bars of doom when he has a awesome grapling hook and can take down the red bars with a single kick?But unfortunatly he has been cursed by the magic evil villian (who sent the army of red bars of doom) and is now a dot but he is still 100% baddass. Now as a dot you must destroy all the red bars to free your self from this horrible curse. but if you become the slightest bit angry then you will destroy all hopes of you ever freeing yourself. luckily he is weraing headphones of calming music so you can kick ♥♥♥ and chew bubbule gum (until your all out of gum) carmly. :)good luck. No realy you will need it considering every time you play the evil magic villain summons more red bars every day. NOW ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT? well you souldn't be cause you are going to do it carmly :)h̶a̶p̶p̶y̶  CALM hunting.reamber dont get angry at the spelling or yo will be stuck a dot
good game realy hard and realy fun but what the hell is with the trailer seriously its scaryer then the game.
