The aim of the game is to be called a hacker in the end, or during the pistol round.10/10
One of the best Call of Duty game out of the series. It's terrible how you can't find much community game mode servers with great ping. Still awesome though, I still love it.
Great Game. 10/10 Would definately take over the world again.
Most rip off game of the year. Won't run.
Good game
