This game is amazing. Its a -'Casual-' RTS set in world war 2. You have standard infantry, tanks, all that jazz. Community is friendly, and above all, gameplay is sweeter than Donald Trump losing in the election. Here is a moment from my gameplay:-'Me-': Hey, Asken, isnt that a Stug?-'Asken-': Yeah, it is. Let me throw a -'nade onto it. *throws AT Grenade*-'Me-': Nice *Tank blows up*-'Asken-': Indeed.-The tank chassis that is now exploded proceeds to destroy my squads cover, killing my medic and leaving my squad open to MG-42 fire. --'Me-': SMOOOOOOOOOTH.-'Asken-': ♥♥♥♥ off.And this is one of the many moments i have had, and will be having in the future. Not to mention the amazing workshop that has a plethora of mods to play and use. Did i mention it has a spectacular editor? Because it does.TL:DRGet this game.+Graphics+Gameplay+Burnt out chassis can kill you and be used as cover-Based on a old engine-Most players use mods for multi-Bots come with the airborne dlc(BS, i know.)
