Personaly my favorite game in the Crysis series solely because of how the nanosuit works. Being able to actively switch between the four different suit mods alows you to instantly adapt to changing situations, add on the instant weapon customisation  and you get one of the most dynamic shooters out there. Still remember one  of my favorite moments in gaming is when i punched a truck into a Korean soldier nocking him flat on the ground only for his buddy to accidentaly shoot the gas tank and blow him up.All in all a great sandbox to endlessly fight an intelligent and tough enemy.*NOTE*(this game dosn't run on some versions of windows. So look into that before you purchase)
