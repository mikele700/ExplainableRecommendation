What a pleasant surprise this game is! This game has been on my HD for a pretty long time. Picked it up on steam sale, but never had the change/time to actually play it. I`m not into the 'beat him up' action games, but I am having a lot of fun with this 1! I thought I needed a controller. But Darksiders can be played easily with mouse & keyboard. Great action, great story-telling and great control!
After all this years, still a great shooter!
Great FUN COOP game, needs dedicated servers to get even better :)
Scariest game i played... EVER! Cant play longer than 15 minutes a session.
Serious shi*t! Ugly, laggy, hackers. Alpha build. Ow well i played worse games in their final. Rust is a game i was waiting for! Fantastic to explore, but dont forget to look around u. Ure killed in a sec......
Great game! Great story! Realy good action. Play it on hard. Then you need to use all the vigors and weapons. 9 out of 10 for me.
Hele coole stoere grappige shooter met mega veel gametijd!
Best RPG i played in years!
