10/10It's even more entertaining when you do things the wrong way and it still works out. Testing the portals on all surfaces and trying to reach somewhere ludicrous has never been more hysterical.The community levels add a new dimension to the possibilities of this game. The creativity of genuises out there is astounding.
Very fun game for the laughs and giggles especially when you die to the most stupid things. Thes best part is unlocking the multitude of characters available for you to fight with. The bad things is the game can be glitchy when playing online with your friend. Get the bugs sorted and it's a great game.
