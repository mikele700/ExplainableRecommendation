The best MOBA game ever made since DotA... Furthermore it is free. WHY THE HECK WOULD YOU NOT PLAY IT. SCREW LEAGUE OF LEGENDS
Well, overall a great game with magnificent maps and awesome community servers. However a terrible competitive system, out of 10 games, you meet trollers in 6 of them and people who afk or abandon early in 2 of them. It's giving us cancer, seriously. Just shut up and play casual/community servers or freaking dota 2 man.
Get the complete edition, without the DLCs, it's simply life without weekends.
This game is damn awesome! Play it, I assure you will not regret! It is free to play too!WARNING: Addictive
