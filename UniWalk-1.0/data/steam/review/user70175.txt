This game.Srsly if you want to lose your life then play this.it is a great game, the only downfall is that it takes ages to get in-game currency and pay to win is REALLY SUPPORTEDbut you can still play with the starter stuff.Also have a good pc to play this. Seriously your framerate will be around 5 if you have a pc that is lower then 8 gb ram
*Sigh* A fun game destroyed by unplayable gameplay mechanics... It's good when you start but DON'T TRY SANDBOX MODE OR ANY OF THE HARDER LEVELS.
This game deserves all the praise it can get.You can date a skeleton, 10/10
A great and really well made game. I didn't really know what to expect when first playing and just moved around for a while before exiting the game. I then again played with friends and instantly it got better. I learnt the controls and actually had fun, it's a really well made game and is really fun to play if you bother to get past the boring learning bit. I hope the developers keep up this level of standard because if they do this game will really be a gem.
