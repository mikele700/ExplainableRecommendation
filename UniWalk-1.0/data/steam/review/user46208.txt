Counter-Strike - The classic game that never gets old. The Multiplayer experience is great for casuals or competitive players alike. Its a joy to play and watch other pros as they showcase their strategies in game. Counter Strike CS GO never gets old as you will always have to compete with others and improve your skill as you play with other players.
Amazing Competitive game with a steep learning curve when you first start playing the game. However, once you get the basics of the game, you will find Natural Selection 2 to be a very fun game with lots of teamwork and strategy involved while you battle together with your teammates to fight for dominance around the map and eventually to win the game. Coordination between teammates and getting more res is key to this game. Great multiplayer experience that will be fun for years to come. Highly recommended.
Like Zombies? Like killing them or become one to kill humans? Well this is the game for you, don wait and get it now! The CO-OP and multiplayer experience is one that you will come back again and again and killing zombies never gets old :)
Super fun open world destruction! Highly recommend. For those of you who love mass destruction with different kind of weapons, this game will sure not to disappoint. Furthermore, Just Cause 2 multiplayer has just been released which means you can cause more destructions with your friends and a server usually hosts around 1000 players! a big + for me :).
