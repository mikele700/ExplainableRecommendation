How to play CSGO:Step 1. Buy $2.49 key. Step 2. Use it on a case. Step 3. Receive $0.10 skin. Step 4. Repeat till broke Half-Life 3/Gaben
The only way to make this game good is to make your character look absolutley ♥♥♥♥ed up. It-'s not worth $70 for a 5 minute giggle to yourself all because your guy looks like a mutant from Fallout 4, that has black parents, a twin sister, and his names -Freq- (Freak).Would rate 2/16, such trash.
Rode a whale into the middle of the ocean, chased a shark, broke my arm by falling from a small tree, got stuck in a ship wreck, found a bucket of fresh water in the ocean. 11/potato. Very realistic. Would do all again
I put a head on a stick and lit it on fire10/10
Only thought about suicide 6 times while playing this game
A lot of bag throwing
-Trove: Adventure, Explore, Create, Dream BIG-So I can do all this after waiting 40 minutes in queue?
i like the part where you pay 2 win but dont even win because there is always someone out there with more money than you.6 diks outta 10defs would never maybe sometimes play again
The following is my experience with Darkest Dungeon:MISS. MISS. DODGE. MISS. RESIST. MISS. DODGE. DODGE. RESIST. MISS. DODGE. SQUAD WIPED. BREAK KEYBOARD. CONSIDER SUICIDE.
