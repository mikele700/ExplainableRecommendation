I would hate to see anyone waste $10 dollers on a bad game like this so heres 3 words i will give you about this games -absolutly freaking terrible-
I would highly recommend this game because of 4 factors-Addons(mods)-Multiplayer-Possibilities -A lifetime of funThis game is very fun and the community is great as i said before i would highly recommend g-mod because of it's outstanding gameplay and physics
this game has spotless gameplay offering 9 unique classes with there pros and cons and even with all these amazing features you would think the game cost money but no it if completley free which makes the game a awesome 10/10 experiance
