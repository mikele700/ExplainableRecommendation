This was a great game when it first started out but as of late you can buy op heros for massive amounts of money that are nessarsary. This game is really hard without payed heros nomatter howmany friends you have although it is beatable and you have to reaply leves more than you should. It can still be fun though by playing an couple of hours regularly.Over all realy good for free to play. 6/10Dowload it but its not for everyone.
This is smooth and polished game with gameplay that matches its butiful graphics. The servers are powerful runing with next to no lagecting to servers can be a hassel.The comunity is nice and helpful and will listen to what you have to say.45/10  :funnycube:
