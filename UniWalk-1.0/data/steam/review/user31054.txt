Great wall of -DLC-
Played the tomb raider 2013 reboot and this one is way better than the first one+Awesome graphics+Awesome story+More tombs with puzzles +More booty <3<3
Got this on sale a while back.  I like games with a good storyline and Metro franchise is definitely one of them. The graphics are good, the monsters are creepy and the humans are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. This game deserves a perfect 10.
