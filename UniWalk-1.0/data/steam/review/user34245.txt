Man I don't even know what to say, this game is so fun! Great survival feel, a little like minecraft except a little more advanced. Definitely recommend to anyone, no matter what ''type'' of gamer you are.
Great game, great atmosphere, really enjoyed it.
It's Telltale, enough said.
Too good not to be played, Telltale reallt have outdone themselves.
Funniest thing I've played in while since Rust, definitely recommend.
Don't know why all the hate, I'm having no issues and am enjoying it so far.Edit: Still enjoying the game so much, runs really well and am having no problems.
How can you dislike this game? Awesome campaigns, great characters, endless amounts of fun. Various gamemodes spice it up a little bit, and if you get bored of the original campaigns, fear not, download a custom map and you're off for plenty more fun.
