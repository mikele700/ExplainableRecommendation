i found this game realy fun and adictive.this is a game that will last hours there are so many things to do and to compleite. your mind will go wild with creative ideas and ways to keep the prisoners entertained. the prisons are mostly easy to start but as prisoners come in it gets harder and harder, but that means it gets funner and funner. the most fun thing to do in the game is to read the prisoners biographies some are stupid and some are really funny
