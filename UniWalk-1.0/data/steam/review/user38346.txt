As Jesus Ketchum, your task is to collect all of the disciples before your arch nemisis does. For your first disciple you get to choose between a water, fire, or grass disciple. Then you need to visit professor John the Baptist to activate your disciple-dex.  I would recommend, when you speak to your mother, to not let her 'save' some of your battle earnings, as you will need it later for trainer battles. 10/10 - would go to heaven again.
You are too hot. You are over heating.  You are too cold.  You need to warm up.  You need to drink You need to eat. You have dissentry.  You need to find a way to cool off.  You are wet.  If you like being constantly nagged at about every article of clothing you are wearing, and zombies, you'll love the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. 10/10
It--'s ♥♥♥♥.If Tropico 5 is your first experience with the Tropico franchise, uninstall right now, and go get tropico 4.Tropico 4 is better in all ways.Tropico 5 is rubbish with multiplayer.If you want to play a multiplayer, go get Civ IV on sale and be happy.Stay away from T5, it--'s sadness.
Video looks good, but gameplay is dissapointing.
