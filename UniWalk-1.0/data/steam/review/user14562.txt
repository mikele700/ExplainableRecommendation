This game was never meant for the -all ages- of steam...I also would give this a neutral however steam only supports yes and no, and I-'m going to have to say no as this was very shallow even for a steam visual novel.
Ummm, not much to say about with this 20 minute vn, unless I-'m missing something there isn-'t really an ending nor a real story, had more fun watching her fail then continue through the -story-.
If you're looking for a darker visual novel, then this is it, throughout you will be confronted with decisions that will result in tragedy or bitter-sweet loss... This visual novel took my heart strings and yanked them out, yet I do not regret playing it.
