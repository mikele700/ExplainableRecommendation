A game that will get you addicted. I've been playing Dota 1 since my 3rd year high school. This game is about Cooperation, you have to carefully think of a strategy on how to destroy enemy's tower and enemy Heroes to advance to their Throne. Also, in this game YOU need to understand your teammates in order to let them understand you, on how you plan to win the game and how you REALLY WANNA WIN EVERY MATCH. Remind yourself to be always 'Calm and Collected'.
