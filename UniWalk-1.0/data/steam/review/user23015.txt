better than the last one
I think it adds alot to ark, whilst i am annoyed they did this instead of making the game run smoother and the price was very annoying i like it, it adds a challenge to the game that wasen't around before
gets boring after a while, started out strong with all the new animals i could find, then died off real quick. it is glitchy and ♥♥♥♥, i just can't really play it with out crashing now.
After some time playing, while a still find the new dome system annoying, the game has grown on me and i play it with some buddys, whle it still has things that need working out it is fine
its good
just yes, every thing is yes about this game.
This game is great for dino lovers (like me), fans of thehunter and for that guy who really likes to just waalk around really large maps and think wow! ---------------         -PROS------------------Very large and plant coverd mapSmall down load size (compared to other games)Great graphicsBeutiful dinosaursModerate AIHard but fun game play------------------       -CONS-------------------Gameplay can get repetative (walking from one side of map to other)fast learning curvenot many dinosaursno swimingdeath plant-flower-thing-------------------------    -OVER ALL SCORE--------------------------I give the TheHunter primal a 8/10
