Tried to lean on table, no table 8/8 great vr m8As a guy who actually plays pool i really enjoy this game. the multiplayer is spot on the banter you can revice with the other players makes this the best vr multiplayer so far :)I could spend hours in this game!
Do you like talking ♥♥♥♥ with randoms while your squad leader figures out how to put down a fob.8/8 great m8 would ♥♥♥♥ talk again.But seriously great alpha get a mic and listen to the squad lead. So happy with my purchase can't wait for things to improve.
This game is the reason i bought a VIVE!!!Great game so far makes you fell like you are really in battle.A few bugs here and there but very very playable.Is a mil sim after all and not made for the casual gamer in my eyes.so if you like ♥♥♥♥ talking to your teammates and signing loudly this game is for you!Also if you didnt realise the VIVE comes with a built in mic so plz activate and use it if you decide to play this game :)
Absoultely love Geralt and his story :)
Although its fairly short the dev has some content updates on the way.great game so far :) gives me my jedi fix!Also dont listen to all the grumpy reviews, VR is still new and to be able to play something like this already is amazing!
nice change up from todays games. makes you feel like a real badass
Shhhhhhhhhh...... now you die :)
Good deep dark story got me playing for hours!
