Seems so simple, your town is growing, that church really looks beautiful over there by itself.... hang on a sec, everyone is dead....A game that seems simple, but as it gets bigger, so do the challenges. There is no such thing as a 'sit back and relax'.If you love micro and a good challenge, this is the game for you :)
Its beautifulEnough said really
Overall this game is a positive. New units, factions and deck types really broaden the playable field. New maps seem to be ok too.My 2 biggest issues however is, A. The campaign where it normally involved only a handful of maps where the AI repeatedly attacks (often pointlessly, with me losing no units) and constantly getting new forces whilst mine canot retreat and refit in time. B. Naval battles are pointlessly imbalanced in favour of PACT with all but the Kongo and OHP class Blufor ships seemingly unable to either hit with or defend against missiles. Meanwhile the Redfor (PACT for me) support ships are numerous, cheap and effective. Whenever a naval battle comes up, my only chance is to kite around whilse launching massive numbers of bombers at the enemy capitals in the hope that one or two will get through.Overall i love the new setup, smoke is amazing and the reverse function is a lifesaver and if i could figure out how to win more consistently multiplayer would be great. But dont buy it for the sole purpose of naval combat and campaign unless you really have time to burn and happen to love the same maps over and over and over and over.....
