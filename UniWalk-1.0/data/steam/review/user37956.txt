One of the better Indie games i've played to date. There are some unfortunate bugs here and there, but none that i've found that are game ruining.★★★★★★★★☆☆8 / 10
This is the game to end all games. Once you have played this game, you will never need to buy another game again. Train Simulator 2012 is THE best game ever created!If your still not convinced!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rulElJITIVY
