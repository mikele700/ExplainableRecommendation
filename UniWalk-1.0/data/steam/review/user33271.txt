Ok Fresh off the plane not knowing what to do so I paddle to an island and I find the basic items needed for an axe once I have said axe I procede to smash crabs till my heart is content I picked up about 10 crabs and off I sailed on my little yellow raft until I see the water moving around something that looked like a post but turns out it was the mast of a sunken ship so I jump off my raft it flips my crabs sink my paddle sinks my heart sinks but I thought no I'm not giving up now so I swim down to the sunken ship confident I will find a spear gun or something to keep me going... what I find filled me with rage.. 1 bucket and 1 lighter of which I already had. I ended up drowing myself and starting again. all in all I had an amazing experience the water the islands the trees are great to look at I found my self climbing trees all the time to see what was next 10/10 would kill more crabs I recommend this game :)
