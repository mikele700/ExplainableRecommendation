Very comlex and in depth 4x with a unique take on combat. Only issues include unexplainable frame rate drops and the AI of the game being a little lackluster, aswell as the -Auto resolve- on conflicts doing unexplainable random things such as loosing a fight with 90% victory estimation. However when you manually control conflicts the system works perfect. 9/10 very enjoyable.

Amazingly fun, very buggy but excusable since its beta and recives regular updates. Would recommend to all, great time for a low price! 9/10
