this game is great, first off this game is brillant for those type of people that love to own there own country and just destroy others in there path but of course it can just be a relaxing game aswell as you build your countrys economy to be one of the best until another country around you declares war on others. supreme ruler ultimate supplys all games SR2020 SRColdwar SR1936 in this you can play in every era of war that has hit the modern age. My personal best is the 1936 and changeing the tide of wars that happened in ww2 Also you can just play as a side nation and chose your alliance or just be an independent nation until war begins. On other turns the AI in supreme ruler ultimate are abit on the turning side but they are greatly improving the mechanices that this game brings to running your country is near identical this game is definetly a game to keep and will be a game to be worth playing for a long period of time.
very good game i like it :D
