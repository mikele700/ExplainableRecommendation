i suggest u get the game like really get it because it could be interesting  the short film is kinda like the intro of 28 days later but with dumb people thinking that its just a harmless clone or whatever it is the activitists of animal rights (28 days later) are better then those guys because they are not as dumb as them no offence but if u see a mutated zombie would you let it out? of course not unless u want to start a outbreak (which could be awesome for you guys)another reason why the activtists are not dumb as them is because they not have a stupid quote that girl is the one im talking about like if i was that girl i would rather shut my mouth then listening to myself now i dont hate the short film but it had some stupid thingslike c mon u guys agree with me dont yaso if i had a choice ethier i free them for u guys to slaughter or to leave them alone i would leave them alone i give the short film a 5/10 so i kinda recommend watching itdo you guys think the animal rights activists are not dumb as them?let me know :)
