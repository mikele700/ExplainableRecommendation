[Insert instructions unclear joke here]I don't have a controller so I had to check the control settings for the keyboard and being a silly goof, I kept pressing Enter to select the keyboard settings but nothing happened so I kept pressing other buttons. After some mild frustration and acceptance of my defeat, I sought the almighty and all-knowing sage, Google, for help and found this controls cheat sheet by the developer https://steamcommunity.com/app/289760/discussions/0/540739319701009463/ I know I'm not the only one who had this problem.. or am I?But apart from my personal struggles, it is a fun game to play with friends (jk I have no friends) or by yourself against AI. It has good music and just the right amount of neon that won't make you gouge your eyeballs out. It would be nice if they added a cursor for easier navigation on the menu though for dimwits like me.Is that a rocket in your pocket?
