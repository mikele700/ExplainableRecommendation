took 10 mins to find out how to go to the next turn 11/10 would next turn again
i havent had this much  cancer since orin prelude
10/10 not better than league
for people that keep saying this game is ♥♥♥♥ and has less content its becasue its alpha of course its got les content ut im mean n a way its got more terms of survial items and others dis it because they either ♥♥♥♥ at the game or just are stupid 12 year olds that KOS i mean get ♥♥♥♥ed if your gonna shoot on sight go play COD again. i have a good pc and if you want to test if your computer can run it try playing crysis 2 or 3 not an ugly looking game like farcry ut i love the game put many hours into the mod ut doesnt show in steam becasue it wasnt linked to steam i put out 500 hours into it and am loving the standalone and i recommened this game if your not a Cod player and have a good pc ut my friends pc which isnt very good can handel it with 25 - 30 fps so buy if you want buy now bacause its gonna go up in price so $30 IS VERY GOOD
you are the fattest person in the game 10/10 hitboxes are ♥♥♥♥ also 25 dollars for a 2 hour story
Get cancer Fume Knight.
get a knife, spam left click ,the rest of the combat is useless oh new combat mechanic set at health station adn heal adn attack a bit then heal and then the other person heals GR8 GAME
its a fun game one problem i have is that your hunger goes down way to fast compared to you water which is more important it takes aboue 5 days o even get half water and 2 to be almost straving but overall its decent
remember the first month every one was friendly and now all the dayz players saved up dollars and now are coming in and ruining it But i love battle royal except all the ♥♥♥♥ing ASIANS
best $15 ever spent <3 already found everything love it <3 i cryed too :(
