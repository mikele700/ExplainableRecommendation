Simply Doesn't work, GFWL will stop you from saving or playing online, seriously. WHY! Playing offline makes a semblence of sence, but not saving. What does microsoft achive from this? Stopping all from playing without going through the game in one sitting (a suicide mission) or using illeagle cracks. They apparantly fixed this problem but still, everytime I load it commands me to install and log into GFWL no problem if it acctualy ♥♥♥♥ing worked. Don't resk it, get in console or pirate it, just don't ♥♥♥♥ing buy it.
