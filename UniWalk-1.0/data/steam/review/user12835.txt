Very enjoyable, just love destroying everything with a bonb. recommended for arcade lovers (the old ones, not the crappy claw games and 50 ♥♥♥♥ING MILLION DRIVING GAMES)
reasonably fun, but looks like its gonna turn into a play to win/pay to win game.
Fun to play with friends, very laugh inducing. Almost started crying at on point out of sheer laughter. Not as fun without friends. Just glad thus game doesn't take itself to seriously
Meh, I would recomened add ons
You have to be in a certain state of mind when you play this game. very frustrating when you go bankrupt. But still fun to play
Amazing for stratergy players like myself, if you wanted to get started in the total war series, I would recommend the first one as its cheaper and easier to get your head around. Crappy launch, but brung it back with patches. 8.5/10
