I honestly don't know what to say. Well it's amazing. Just the atmosphere created alone is enough for me aswell as the gameplay, replayabilty, endless options, RPG elements and modding community. Not to mention it's fairly cheap for a awesome game.To start off the emmense variety of ship layouts, random events(YOU CAN FIND FLOATING GUNS!), weapons, crew, enemys, upgrades, systeams, places and quests are a standout part of this game. Coupeled with the music which plays out to the action taken place and where you are (loud and upbeat when in danger or ambient and peaceful when safe), theres also the little systeam sounds( opening doors and pressing buttons etc..) and the pixelised artwork thats perfectly designed all fit together. Lastly victory is SO SATISFYING, after such a long journey it IS worth the trip.Altogether AWESOME 10/10
One of the best games i have played. Limitless content with or without mods unlike many saimilar games. Beautiful music and graphics with the 2D view giving it character and it doesn't take away gameplay and creativity. Pixel artwork is lovely and pristine. Crafting is both deep and simple with ever recipe viewable. Excellent and dynamic late game variety with endless things to make and do. Fun enemys and bosses that are challenging. Map sizes are big enough for anything. Nice RPG elements and focues like bullets or magic. Variety in biomes that show difference. Customiseable appearence so you can look how you want to look. Overall amazing game 9/10.
