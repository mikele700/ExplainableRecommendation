Game crashes a lot. Worth if it's $5 i reckon.Turning down all the gfx and putting the game into windowed mode helped a little.
This game is not good.The story makes no sense at all.The combat is slow and the same throughout the whole game.And this game is very very hard. even on easy i had trouble beating it.Not recommended
worth a fiver
Please be aware! Your free game time begins when you create your account, NOT WHEN YOU START PLAYING THE GAME, LIKE NORMAL GAMES!!!!!! I did not know this and so lost my money as far as i'm concerned. Not even gonna bother. All I did was update the game through the launcher. Thanks for nothing Square Enix
Great story. Worth buying for the ending alone.If you want action this is NOT the game to buy
About as cheesy as a John Cena movieOr Shoot Em' Up. oh god shoot em' up was cheesy. Like Pont lâ€™Eveque level cheesy
