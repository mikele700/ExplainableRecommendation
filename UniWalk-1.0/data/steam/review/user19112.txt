i find this game a little boring to play without friends simply because so much time in it is spent hack away at the ground and watching a loading bar. The exploring is fun though and the honest to god only complaint i have is that doing things like digging tunnels and flattening land just takes to long. Other than the stated problem  i do like this game, i just hope they make doing things a little quicker. dont really wanna be watching a loading bar for 3 hours just so i can make a copper axe
