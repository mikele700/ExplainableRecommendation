This game is great it's really realistic and has that Rainbow Six feel to it I reccomend this to people who like to play competitively or for people who want dayz
Counter Strike started out as a mod for the original Half-Life and now has exploded into one of the most popular shootersI think Global Offensive is a great addition even with all those gritty pros out there online is still a blast I reccomend this to people who like shooters and don't mind there ♥♥♥♥ getting kicked in
First off im cutting this game some slack because its in early access but lets get in to my review.This game you could describe as a wooden sheild all round great but wares out quickly this game has some great ideas and things but as it is in early access it gets boring quick and i know the devs do work on this daily which i really appreciate.So to make it more enjoyable and longer lasting experience heres some ideas for the devs-make the helper bot be able to replinsh items on shelfs,pedestals,etc its a bit of a hassle to refill the armour rack when somone buys somthing-add some sort off competitve multiplayer thing where you can vs other peoples shops in every aspect like revnue,customor satisfaction,efficentcey and stuff like that -have the town area more lively so you can vist like a tarvern or somthing to learn skills,other shops to rival and stuff like that-add more setting for perfomance so this game can run on toasters like mine
