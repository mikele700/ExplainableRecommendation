A fun, short(ish) cross between RPG and a business simulator.  Graphics are isometric, nothing really to write home about but serve their purpose.  Mechanics deep enough for a playthrough.
Fun LIght RPG with comedy.  Definately not a hardcore game, but still fun.
DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP.  WORST MOST CORRIDOR FILLED GAME EVER.
One of, if not the best RTSs I have ever played.  Very realistic (for a game), and solid mechanics, would totally recommend (also cheap for the quality)
Brillaint RPG and brilliant modding community, only let down by being somewhat prone to crashes/bugs
