Its a fun and innovative way to play a game and definitely one you should try out. But, going up the tier ladder is pretty hard and strenuous so if you want to have a really good time in the higher tiers you have to work for it. Its worth the time though tier 8 and above is really fun and some of the designs people build are hilarious. :D Thumbs up 10/10
