While I am a big fan of the AC franchise, and already have a strong sense of bias when it comes to AC games, I feel that AC3 was more of a let down than anything else. While there were some new things that were awsome such as the combat system, the free running dynamics and the open world frontier gameplay, there were still some major things that plagues this game. The first being the VERY long tutorial/training section of the game. Without any spoilers, you almost have to go through Connor's entire childhood before you are really set free upon the world. Also on the PC version, there were some graphical and audio glitches. While we are discussing the PC version, one of the biggest issues I had was how badly optimized this game was for PC. Don't get me wrong, I have a GTX 770 and a 4770K, which are by no means entry level or mid range. However, I still had MAJOR, and I mean MAJOR frame rate drops. I would coasting along at 60FPS and then suddenly as I turn the conner to look at 4 people, BAM!!! 40FPS.In conclusion, I would skip this game I were you. AC4 fixes all the problems I had with this game and it much more enjoyable to play. If you interested in the story, just watch it on youtube.
Visually appealing and intelectually intriguing, Bioshock Infinite is definately a major leap forward from the first two games. It resolved any issues I had with the first two and then some. If you like the first Bioshock games you will love this. Even if you have not played the other games, Infinite will be great fun to play through. Infact, I recomend buying the tripple pack as it is only 5USD more right now (This can change in the future)
