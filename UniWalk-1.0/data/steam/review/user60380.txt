GREAT GAME, god graphics, small amounts of lag and nice comunity!
this is a stradegy game that depends on every players gameplay, for instance if one of your team feeds then you will have a very bad tim eplaying it because the enemy becomes stronger will kill more and get more stronger and so on, so yeah this game isnt compairable to lol, lol is just a friendy gaem than dota, in dota you use more mental stradegy like when is a good time to use an ability and stuff, also in dota you acually can communicate with your team, u can tell them to do this taht as long as it sounds good other than leauge its almost impossible, this game is just epic and deserves my recommendation , sadly there are less plyers than lol which takes down one of my scores, people need to relise that this game is more stragistic than leauge, the reason i give lol a point is because of its graphics, if you want to play a game with awesome graphics then play leauge, but other tha n taht i dont really like leauge, dota should get the game of the year award but sadly its not getting it
