I love everything about it. Learning new things about space is so cool and I wish I bought this game earlier. System reqirements are really low as well so you don't need a 980 GTX ti to enjoy the graphics because they look great on the lower end of graphics cards anyway.The only thing I would like in the game is when planets collided it would be awesome if you could slow it down and watch them form into a super planet. Because at them moment the planets don't grow any bigger if you smash them together and one of them kind of vanishes and all you can see if a bright light, if you look at it close up. But that might require a super computer and then they would be false advertising ;). Other than that I think it is perfect.
