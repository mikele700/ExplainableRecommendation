First off - Why all the hate on for asking to buy some stuff the developers have to make some money or they cant run the game thats how Online Games work... You dont have to have a cent and you can get up in those leaderboards people complaining on reviews saying oh its Rubies or 150,000 Gold for a Rare Gem im getting average of 7000 gold for 3 minute maps...This game is a fun little game to play your not in Dungeons for too long you can choose to play Solo or Guild Play or Just join up with a few randoms it doesnt get lonely there is alot of Heroes in the game to draw and the only way to get the Ultra Rare heroes is by completing the 15 Weekly Event Quests not a cent to spend- So Even if you have 10 Minutes to play you can fit in 2 dungeons and the ability to play my character on Mobile & Computer is awesomeThe only issue i have is Lag alot of people have that issue it just needs adressing.10/10 Will keep playing :) Just fix that Lag guys :P
