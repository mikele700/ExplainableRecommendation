First impressions are good.  Tutorials are helpful.
quick fun
.
If you liked the first game you will like this one.  It's a lot faster paced but still has the great music, art, story, etc. of the first game.  If you haven't played the first get that too :)
It's not really a game more like a chore..
Civ 5 what more can I say... 
Well made game with days if not weeks of gameplay time. Addictive, challenging, looks nice, sounds good and has nice humour.
Smart puzzles. There is a lot more to this game than you think and if you want all the achievements you will be here for DAYS if not longer.
