This game is very fantastic. This is best Paradox game that I ever play. This could be the 2nd Game that is in my favorite list below Medieval II: Total War Kingdoms. So I really recommend you this game. Worthful and especially for those who likes the Medieval, Crusade, or Levantian history... I bet they will like this game. Why do I recommend this game? first of all, I really like the Crusade history and levantian history and second, this game has a great gameplay, history, and graphic. Well then, Thank You.
Very great strategy game.
