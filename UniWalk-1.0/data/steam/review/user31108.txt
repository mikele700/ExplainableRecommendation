CS: GO is a first person RPG strategy multiplayer top-down RTS MOBA teabagging simulator. -Quite possibly the worst game I-'ve ever played, the community is toxic, the graphics are terrible and the gameplay is the worst of any game in this genre. 9/10- - IGN1v1 me IRL on Rust quickscopes only.
this game is ♥♥♥♥ing sick
