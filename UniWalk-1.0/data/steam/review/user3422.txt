Looking at screenshots I thought it would be a nightmare to navigate but it works really well. Took me awhile to work out how everything works and the mechanics are still pretty confusing, but a beautiful, minimalistic, dungeon crawl FPS. My one gripe is that some of the enemies are a little OP (turrets shoot you while still in -powering up- mode, bomb bugs move fast too fast, they get in your face when you shoot them).
Talk to yourself while playing, it helps.
Don't bother.
Boring and tedious. Nice scenary however. As someone who usually goes for this sort of narrative game I can say that I-'m just disappointed by how unengaging the -plot- is, which is really a major flaw considering this is the only thing the game could have going for it as the game-play itself is simply repetitive and uncomplicated.JUST BORING.
Says it's an hour of gameplay. I did two playthroughs in 41 minutes with about ten minutes of wandering around uselessly. Boring in every way.
