CS GO IS LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Very good game....get a friend to carry and youll be happy
I once was a good man, who believed in justice and would forgive people for their mistakes...NOT WITH THIS ♥♥♥♥ GAME!I was a young adult, 19 I was. Having had a good weekend so far it would all change on the last day of the weekend. Saturday, waking up feeling good because there isn't much to worry about in life because you've woken up knowing that you don't have to do ♥♥♥♥ till Sunday. Aura Kingdom had been completed for me, I was patience...initial download one hour...very good...then came the launcher...with it...came the most slowest update I've had since learning how the Pluto wasn't a planet anymore during age 13. 6 whole hours I stared, 6 whole hours i waited...but it was k...I was patience. I got into the game and oh boy was it worth the wait. My world was open when I saw the nice models of characters, the diverse customization, the ranges of class and its clear explanation on how each class works...then came the hard part...I had to choose between a unicorn or a dragon...it broke my heart to only have to choose one...so I choose the pink slyph cause I do wa i wan. I started playing the game...loved the combat...loved how a fat man only has to click the quest and it moves you there...loved how every hour the server would freeze and be ok again...for 4 hours I used the auto route...for 4 hours I trekked throught the world of the game called Aura Kingdom...I was a happy man...so I took a break...played a couple of MOBA games...finished them...but then everything changed. It was now the last day of the weekend, I go back to the game...only to find that my happiness was a lie...the launcher...would not launch the game...my 4 hours had been a lie. I wanted answers so I went to the main website...it was down...for an hour already...I couldn't get back on and make those 4 hours I spent on it even longer...why you do this game.Moral of the story: ♥♥♥♥ game
