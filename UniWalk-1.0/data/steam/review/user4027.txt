A fun ARPG with a heartwarming story behind it's development, it's hard not to root for this game's success. Of course, it's not like I have to, because the game is good enough to stand on it's own merit. Good humour, a good story, and good combat mechanics make this a game that's a lot of fun to play. Finally, it's cross-platforminess is a huge draw as it means you can continue playing crashlands wherever you want! (Side note: cross-platforminess is the reason why I still use Google Chrome, despite it's flaws.) All up, it's well worth the $20 you need to buy it on PC and mobile.
