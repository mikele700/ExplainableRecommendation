This game is good and this review is pointless.
I loved Batman: Arkham Asylum so much that I was kind of afraid of Batman: Arkham City. I worried that the stars wouldn't align to produce a game as good as the original, or that the game would just recycle the original without offering us anything new or surprising. I'm happy to say I was wrong on both counts. Batman: Arkham City is not only as good as the original - it's also not the same game.
There's only 1 explanation for this:MEEEEEEEEEEDICCCCCC!
