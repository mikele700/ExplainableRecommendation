Great game, love the combat mechanics added with the learning curve of different combo's and the skill involved in dodging their attack. The only complaint is the servers it runs on, whenever i play it puts me on servers that run with 200+ ping so its impossible to time the combos or dodge their attacks. A real let down to an otherwise amazing game!
