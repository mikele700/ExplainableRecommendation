I used to think that games used to be about skill and how well you work with a team of freinds/strangers. All that changed when I got TF2 (Hat Simulator 2014). I am educated now and know that the things you need to be good at this game are:-Unusual Hats worth only $50000-A once full, now empty life savings account-Hats-Hats-HatsIn this game you will select one of 9 characters which all have their special OP power which will make even the most patient monk rage quit. This game is about your character going on a pointless, perilous journey in order to get all the keys ever made by Valve. No one knows why you try and complete this story, but if you don-'t your freinds might get more keys than you and you don-'t want that. Eventually you spend all your money and/or life to buy these over-priced hats and boast to some guy on the other side of the world about how cool your $560000 hat is, only to have him call you a n00b and show you his $560001 hat and proceed to kick you from the server for being a skrublord. In this game you will experience several  gamemodes such as:-Kick everyone on the server who makes a mistake A.K.A Tour of Duty-Practice of Kick everyone on the server who makes a mistake A.K.A Boot Camp-Show off your sexy hats to people who you deem beneth thyself A.K.A Trade servers-School of sniping A.K.A 2fort-Custom gamemodes which can somtimes be more fun the the default game A.K.A Custom games-Every other gamemode with people who you deem Free2play A.K.A Every other gamemode with people who you deem Free2play The best part of the game (apart from the 10/10 hat simulation) is when after 10 mins of you being one of the only contributors to your team and right about to win the game with your freinds, you get switched for -auto-ballance- ad end up on a loosing streak. SO FUUUUUUUUUUUN AND BEST FEATURE OF ANY GAME!!!Because of this game I have no money, no freinds and no life, but I have hats and really... isn-'t that what life is all about? 10/10 would play again
