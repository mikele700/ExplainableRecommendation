Where to start....NEGATIVES:First off if your shooting an enemy they can fire back at you even while taking damage with aimbot precision.Second game glitches are just painful especially in missions.Third an enemy one level above you can just tear through you like a hot knife through butter.Forth enemy snipers have Quick scoping aim bots before they even come out of cover.Fifth a shotgun can almost one shot you from 100m away as the spread is pathetic.Sixth street thugs have military if not aim bot style gun fire.POSITIVE:Pleasing to the eyesStory is pretty decient
