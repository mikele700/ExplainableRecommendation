Oh Payday I wish i could love you but like a drug ridded best friend as much as i hope you recover, i wish you would die.
Tired of playing as the good guy? well then this is the game for you! Payday the heist is a rich game full of combat and teamwork, play alone or play with your friends its always fun. plus if you have left 4 dead or left 4 dead 2 your can drop by Mercy Hospital for a fast paced chaotic one of a kind robbery. Its Fun For The Whole Family!P.S(Last part not true)
is good
WTF did i just play?
Half-Life is one of those games, a game you will spend hours on without even knowing. Its a game that has really left a impact on me as a gamer and is so good its still being talked about now. Half-life is a master piece in story telling and non-linear gameplay, and with its HD remake -Black Mesa- out now for free there-'s never been a better time to slip into your H.E.V suit for a Sci-fi, puzzle solving, alien and zombie killing EXTRAVAGANZA!!
