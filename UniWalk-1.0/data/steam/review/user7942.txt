Still wondering why I sat down for over an hour spamming random buttons to get friend zoned by a game
Casually found a dog wearing armour so I went ahead and pet it, it's neck got longer so I did what any normal person would do, I spammed pet for about 5 minutes until the dogs neck went to space and came back down to earth again...Oh and this is also a great game, I highly recommend getting it
very good game lol
10/10 zombies are on drugsyus
This game has more 12 year olds then all the pre schools in the world put together 1337/420
Game is way too addicting, if you liked fallout 3 you will love this game and you'll probably spend most of your life on it
10/10 ign the zombie A.I can walk though wallsjust part of the experience
