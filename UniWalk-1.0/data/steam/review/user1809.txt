Lan PartiesOk So downloading this game it seemed frightening at first with the controls and gameplay style. But now after playing 10 mins of the game I’m already loving it. I see that this game has a massive future in gaming with lots of friends. One of the first games that I’ve seen which allow many users to play at the same time on the same screen. Also the fact that people can play on their phones, tablets also allow everyone to join in and participate in the game.The Game's FutureOk so, the online community is very friendly indeed. I’m always seeing heaps of open servers that are packed with friendly and fun people. With all of this taken into account, I see a very good future for this game. It’s one of many which provide a unique lobby of 16 players with heaps of custom power-ups, interesting maps and characters. Hopefully with more to come. This game has a huge amount of potential. With 4 possible game modes already, adding more would make this game even more interesting (if that’s possible).I recommend this game for everyone to try out. Its defiantly one that'll provide enjoyment for hours on end.
