This game is great.More content than Hearts of Iron II.I can play in full HD resolution with Windows 8.1 64 bit, but there are some laggy issue, however.If you have many -what if- questions about the Great War and the Second World War. Buy this game and you won-'t regret.
Shoot and run.Better than ever with Serious Engine 3.There are some puzzle, too.Co-op mode will give you a far better experience than a single player mode.Fun to play with friends.
German humorous are totally dangerous.
Pros:-One of the best co-op game of all time.-Fun with friends-A ton of mod to unlock-Nice soundtrack-There are some free DLC's, too.Cons:-Friends/Foes AI are not smart.-The graphic engine is a little bit outdated.-There are no drill that really works properly.-Guard is too much easily paranoid in Overkill and Death Wish Recommended: Buy the GOTY edition when it's on sales and you won't regret it.
One of the most fun co-op game is back with Serious engine 3!Play with your friends and have a good time.
Counter-Strike with ragdoll physics is still great despite of its being 10 years old.
