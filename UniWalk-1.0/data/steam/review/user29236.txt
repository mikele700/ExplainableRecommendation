Watch dogs is a great game, i understand the people who say its just a cheap copy of gta and i kind of agree. Watch dogs is similar to gta but still has differences that makes it a different game. i would recommend this game not for mucking around but for the story line. The story line is much better than gta's story line and with the addition to the DLCs, it makes it much more interesting. For graphics it is quite good but has been downgraded, but that is understandable, since some pcs arent as strong as consoles.
very fun game its addictin too but it would be more fun if there were more people playing it then you would be able to play more people
