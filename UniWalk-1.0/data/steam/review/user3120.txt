So I have played this game a lot, as you can see. I would have to say that it is my favorite game. Ever. I-'ll break it up into groups.Gameplay:10/10, you get to meet new characters with personallitys everywhere around the game. The characters themselfs are good enough to make any game, well, good.Music:11/10, you can-'t really get a better mix of music and gameplay than in this one, as the code and music was both written by the same guy (Toby Fox). Like how the song -Asgore- has an extreme mix of a dramatic, sad, intense, and angry feel. And how Snowdin Town and Snowy both have a feeling that makes you feel as if it were a sunny day, in a snow covered village (which in a way that is what it was).Bosses:10/10, all of the bosses are like other bosses you will fight, just with personallity. Unless.. you do the genocide run. It-'s extremely emotional at first, then it gets extremely difficult when you meet some of the next bosses. Just it never drops that feel.TIPS BEFORE YOU PLAY; Go in as blind to the game as possible.Play pacifist first, it-'s just better that way.
This is by far my favorit game at only the rank of blackbelt. Why? Because its addicting as @%#$.
