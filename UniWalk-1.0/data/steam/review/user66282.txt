Scumbag money grabbing devs don't finish their game before releasing paid for content. It took a while for the devs to show their true colors.Beware if you intend to buy this game you should know that the devs priority is not to finish the game, not to optimise or polish their product. Their priority is to drain every shekel from the playerbase with the minimum required effort.
