I don-'t like Ocarina of Time anymore anyway.....--Do you remember those games that you played, that immersed you so much you almost seemed to lose track of real life?Well saying that about Undertale would be a crude understatement. I don-'t want to spoil this game for any one who hasn-'t played it, but in short Undertale is a RPG that-'s willing to take everything you know about the genre, and challenge it to a godlike level, while still remaining a -Role-Playing Game-. As you play, be wary of the term -'Role-Playing-', as you may find that as time goes on your part in the game is more than just a mere -'role-'.I genuinely love this game, and hope it-'s appreciated for years at the very least, because there isn-'t a single RPG (out of 100-'s of classics I myself have played, like Chrono Trigger, FF7 etc.) that has handled emotion and character development as well as Undertale.P.S. Avoid tumblr posts before you play it, if possible?
