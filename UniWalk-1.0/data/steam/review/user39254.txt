Dishonored is probably one of the most underappreciated  games in my library, which is why I've chosen to write a quick review on it.It has all the aspects of any good game; High quality graphics, captivating soundtrack, in-depth story line and smooth gameplay. Yet I can't help but feel that this game never got the attention it deserves, bar a small buzz following the initial release. Perhaps people felt it was just a mock-up of assasins creed? Because I guess the protagonist mildly resembles Desmond Miles?But Dishonored has you emotionally invested after the first few minutes of cut scenes. The game progresses in saving Emily, the young princess, and overthrowing the corrupt government. Which doesn't take too long after you've been hooked on the game's unique gameplay, versatile powers and lootability. Most people could finish the game in 20 hours, if not 15. But beyond the main storyline is a well designed city, overflowing with intricate details and side quests. Not to mention the game allows you to replay different missions, to give the game a different outcome. Even if one run-through is 15 hours, there are hundreds of hours worth of possibilites .Dishonored is a beautifully constructed game and I recommend it to gamers from any genre; action, adventure, rpg, puzzle etc.
