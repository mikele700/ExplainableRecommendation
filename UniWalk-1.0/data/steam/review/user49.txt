This game Is great.Its charmingits imersiveits funAnd it works every time for me. I have no idea what others are complaining about.Anyways.In my opinion i like it even slightly better than Gta 5 which i own.it has such a good story and ypu can dictate the story on several occasions like choosing to kill or not kill somebody which affects you later on positively or negativly or choosing weather to accept an offer or not.The combat is imersive. as you harm an enemy their preformance goes down and you cand shoot them a mlion times in the hand to kill them. This is still up for a little improvementsMods can be very fun and after finishing the story i reccomend installing one after finnishing the story.However you should install an ENB asap because it greatly enhances the graphics.

I Have Played 60 hours of this brilliant different type of strategy game and i haven't had enough. The game is still very long so watch out.
