just finished Undertale after weeks and weeks of playing, so worth it.
I am making this review while Slender is paused in another tab and I am utterly terrified I have five pages in the second level and I and so surprised I made it this far because this s*** is HARD!
the most intense RPG you can buy on the steam store or somthing like that.
this game is free DLC for BRO FORCE and it lives up to it's EXTREME brother nicely
Think of one reason to not like this game.
