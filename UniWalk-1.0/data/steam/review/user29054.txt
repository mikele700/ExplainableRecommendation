This is a great game, I really enjoyed it, good story, doesn't feel linear, and was fun. The only reason I can’t recommend it is because of the price vs playtime. I finished the game in only 3 hours, which for the price I paid for it seems like a rip off, and I don’t believe there’s too much replayability. If it was $10 cheaper I would highly recommend it.
