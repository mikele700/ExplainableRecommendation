Dis game is gud :3
This game definetly has potential, but some of the aspects are stupid, and somehow ridiculous. I've collected gear, a pistol a bow and a bunch of food and armour. I see some zombies so i pass by and bout 6 zombies are chasing me for a bout 20 minutes. They're extremely fast, they don't have a stop-following radius or distance so i literally died and lost all my stuff. It's just stupid.... I wasted my time playing this, i hope that gets fixed. Make the zombies slower because i don't want them following me around the whole map.
