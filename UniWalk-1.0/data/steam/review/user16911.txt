this game made me realise how dirty my screen is. so i took a napkin and wiped the monitor while this game is still running.then my mom came in....she never looked so dissapointed.....10/10 will dissapoint parents again.
One of the best games in the olden days. Great storyline combined with good music and thrilling atmosphere really gives you the adventurer kind of vibes. Pros:-Great story-Great classic music tracks-good atmosphere-ModsCons:-Sometimes mysteriously crash-A little glitch here and there. (Bethesda trademarked glitches and bugs)-No sprint button (can be solved with mods tho)Overral i rate this game 8/10 and i recomend this to everyone that likes adventure games in general.
Save me from the nothing i have become....
very good for a cheap price. reccomended if you like mystery, psychological, horror. Story Oriented RPG. P.S dont try grind level cus some endings require you to be low-leveled)
Art 2 Gud.
great storyline, a nice change of pace when you are tired of playing other games in our library
