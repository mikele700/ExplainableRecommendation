Great game, you can tell just by the number of people reviewing this game negatively with over 100h (or 400h) played.Sure there are a few bugs, but the devs are working hard on fixing stuff, communicate with the community and release patches with a lot of new content every other month.This is a game based on grinding, and sometime it will take time to get your gears just the way you want it. But the DZ is a great experience, with some balancing issues that will shift the meta of the game strongly towards a build here and there.Haven't seen a hacker in 2 months (playing the DZ fairly often, rank > 82). People saying the game is full of hackers are the same guys that get rekt in CS and call hacks on everyone.  I strongly recommend this game for both the PvE and the PvP aspect.
Loads of fun. Motions of the character really makes me feel like a Ninja!
The best FPS of all times. A lot of DLC coming regularly. Kudos to valve !
