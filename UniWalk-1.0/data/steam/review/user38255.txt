Being a VIP Backer of this game when it was started on kickstarter I got to watch this game develop from the ground up and can happily say that the progress in which it has come from the tech demo is awesome. Awesome vehicles, a solid assortment of vehicles with awesome add-ons to change up on the trucks to suit any situation whether it be needed for hauling, repairing, fueling or just plain Sunday cruising. Awesome terrain with water crossings, narrow timber bridges, hill climbs, dirt roads, muddy roads, tarmac roads or why not make your own road. It can be a logistical nightmare whilst doing long hauls on your own whilst having to consider damaging your vehicle, low fuel and just plain getting lost but with multiplayer being implemented it is sure to be the perfect package.  If you are like me and love driving, driving games or even off-roading in real life then this is the game for you. You will not find a better off roader. Highly recommended!

Quality story, would recommend/10. Enough said.
