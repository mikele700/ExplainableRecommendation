A friend and i got into a party to start the campaign. We started buffering for a game and then i joined one and he didn't. So basically we were in the same party and we somehow we got seperated and couldn't join the same game. Would love to review some of the gameplay but this is as far as we got before we switched back to having more fun playing TF2. Has amazing potential, but i honestly don't think it will get to the same stage as the games alike i.e. TF2
