-I built a beautiful city, where problems where near non-existent...--But then we expanded, bringing industry and demand to Skylines City...--That-'s where we fell...--The water supply was contaminated by sewage, the city was ravaged by crime and our factories fell to fires and (above all) unemployment...--Then I figured, -Well, Skyline City is screwed...-Then I restarted.Do I recommend this game that pays attention to detail, seems as realistic as city builders get and is stunning in terms of what you can make?What do you think? Of course I do!
