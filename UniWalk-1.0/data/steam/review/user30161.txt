A story very unlikely to be told, very beautiful and touching in a different way.
Explainations are everywhere. This game is amazing, with a place that we couldn't imagine. Beautiful story line, written in a creative way yet scientifically true eventhough it's just a game.
9 characters with diffrent stats, teamwork, a match that can be won in less than 1 hour, a huge variety of maps, weapon drops. All of them in one game, and it's cheap. Doesn't cost more than 5 dollars to be premium. And i put all the blame to hackers, f2p that doesn't even know how to fire a shot, and annoying people that doesn't chat with international language for ruining the game. But overall, it's still a good game. Oh, and also, hats.
Best. 2D. Sandbox. Ever.
Basically a moba game, set in a zombie apocalyptic world where ones must survive hordes of zombies. And we don-'t need to stress about MP, there-'s none. WASD to move. Overall, this game has a -newer- style rather than other MOBA games. Nice weapons, craftable. Currently not P2W. Simpler GUI. You need to aim. Combining fps and moba is a great idea.
still have a lack of story, but 4 bucks for an amazing graphics? it's worth it
The only problem that i can find is: the view is too beautiful.
ahh, good ol' days. Almost the same as minecraft, but with more items, angles, and workspace.
Shut it down. Shut it all down. It's taking too much time to just win a match, especially if you only have 2 days at a week to play. I'm definitely not gonna waste my time to just play 15 matches a day, if that even possible.
Badgers aren't cute, they're just... adorable. I must admit.
