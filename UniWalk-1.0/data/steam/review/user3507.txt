Take your DVD copy of SouthPark, mix with your own fantasy of being a main charater on the cast, and make it interactive, is that is this game in a nutshell, A match made in glorious fecal matter, race, sexuality, and political jokes heaven. If you have the money, a fairly flexibly sense of humor, and empty stomach, and stones of well .....stone then this is right up your alleyIf you ever happen to watch south park or better a regular fan of it you owe it to your self to get this and pee yourself at the amount of content,m new and in reference.The only downsides are if you dont like the humor, i'd watch some episodes or some plythoughs first to see if you can take the content.  also post story there isn't much to do. i'd reccomend buying it around 15 dollars-ish due to the single player only experience, though you can play up to 4 playthoughs each with the unique classes.
