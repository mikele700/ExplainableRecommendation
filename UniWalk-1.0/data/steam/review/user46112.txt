Fantastic game with almost 0 pay-2-win aspects. Feels like a destiny/Borderlands game with level clearing and boss fights with unique elements. Fantastic visuals and interesting level design, unlike other first/third person shooters this game combines parkour and quick paced movement in vertical environments and large zero gravity space missions. I would reccomend this game game to anyone who likes shooters and co-op games. I have played 200 hours as of this review.
