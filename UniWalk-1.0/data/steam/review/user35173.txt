I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the civilization series, likes turn based game play and who generally likes strategy games. The good+ Extremely fun game play.+ Endless re-playability.+ Great visuals.+ Great multiplayer.+ A tons of mods to try out. + Cool and interesting Civilizations.The Bad- A.I. needs some works but can still play a decent game against a human player( but many strategy games need better  A.I.  so its not too bad compared to other strategy games)- The DLC is a little bit too expensive.- The difficulty needs be less about A.I. cheats but more about making the A,I, smarter for a better challenge.But still I find this game to be one of the most fun and best strategy games out there. So check out!!!
