I am enjoying this game immensly! A fantastic city builder. Before this game came out I was looking for a city builder and couldn't decide between sim city 4 or the recent sim city. On one hand you had updated graphics and a smoother interface, and on the other it was functionaly better. This game gave me the best of both worlds!
Rogue Legacy was a really fun little 2D action platformer. I picked it up on sale but it is defenitly worth its original asking price. Its fun, challenging and charming in everyway and reminiscent of darksouls.
Why are you reading reviews. This is one of my favourite all time games, and is in my opinion around as awesome as skyrim itself. Purchase!
This game is love, and this game is lifeIf this game was cake, it would be one delicious cake Seriously though, this game will give you at least as much fun and hours as any AAA game. Do yourself a favour and buy this game.
Incredibly Fun. It is a whole different ball game surviving with 2. It can be both a hinderance and a blessing. You need more food, but you can collect more between the 2 of you. My one suggestion is that you play with only 1 or 2 other people at the start and make sure you know them so they will co=operate
