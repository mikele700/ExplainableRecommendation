I've always had a soft spot for cute farming or monster capturing games, and I haven't seen too many games like these (e.g. Harvest Moon, Monster Rancher); especially on PC. So this is a game I loved instantly! Capture slimes, feed them (or they'll cause trouble...) and collect 'plorts' to earn money. Reminds me of my old farming/monster simulation playing days. Very fun and incredibly cute!You just can't help but love those adorable, mischievous little slimes! Can't wait to see how this game develops! :D
