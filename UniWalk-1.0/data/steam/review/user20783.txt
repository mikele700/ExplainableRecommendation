Best community. Very nice people and are always willing to help. Heaps of workshop items that make almost every table top game possible to play. Even played table top mini golf. Regular people who teach you how to play new games.
Its ok but not great yet. It takes ages to -rank up- and you only het 5xp for each kill. If you get into a battle that has not started you must wait 2:30min for it to start. The weapons are overpriced.  Its realistic but needs a lot of work. For a f2p game it is ok.
Great graphics, landsharks, shipwreaks to explore and you can build your own house. It would be intresting to play with someone else. Also sharkfood simulator 2015
Great game, please add multiplayer again it would be really fun
Getting better, still not there yet though. Finally a single player survival, but still need friends to have alot of fun.
Great fun and easy to use. This is a very good starting software for people wanting to create posters or short movies.
Really fun game to play. Is very funny and sarcastic but at the same time lots of puzzles involved. Can sometimes lag but overall it is a good game
Good fun. Very Relestic. There's something about blowing up things that justs gets you going
Good game, will be even better when servers for the public are up
great game for F1 fans, hard at first but get better through the season
