Ever finished a dump and then had your finger go through the toilet paper when you wiped?That's pretty much how I feel about having been a Kickstarter contributor for this sorry excuse for a scam game.
Utter crap at any price - don't bother.
Quirky and cool. A great 2D puzzle game.
Another great game from Bethesda. 'Tis a shame that Steam has to be running to play it (I would rather have the overheads used by Steam to shove more mods into Skyrim).
Great game (if you like turn-based strategy games).
Great f2p PvP action. A game I keep returning to again and again.
Single-player swords & magic Action/RPG. Amazing array of mods available (I am currently running 160+ mods - some of which I created myself). Warning: Modding can become as addictive as the game itself.
