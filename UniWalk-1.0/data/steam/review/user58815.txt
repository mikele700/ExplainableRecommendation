it will not load up on the home screen so i cant play it ;P
This game is very worth buying for only $20 in fact it is the best Alpha i have played in a long time :) the only down side of this game is that there are a stupid amount of hackers who will just take away hours, days even weeks of work. If you look on my rust photos that ive been bothered taking you'll see what im talking about!!! >:( But a good way to deal with this is to join a friend that knows if there are hackers on their server or a better way join a youtuber's server becasue they are the ones that really care. Hope this helps!!!!!! :)
