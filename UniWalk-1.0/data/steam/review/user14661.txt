Unique game which is free ofc with mirco transactions that arent really micro however they do go on sale alot of times. This game is a fast pace third person moba game wahtever its called and its really fun. the background commentary is quite funny and sometimes quite useful. The background commentary also never repeat in my experiences. For low levels it is really hard to find matches meaning you have to make a customs matches with higher level people which mean you either lose horribly or get carried in most moba games. Another down note it has a lack of players meaning if you dont want to make a custom match with randoms and want to solo queue it will take about 30 mins+ for people level 1-19. Some positive notes the classes are balanced and none are really that OP however the diffcult pros are really weak if you dont know how to play the class. I find that once your under level you really cant catch up useless they become monkeys are lose the game on purpose.    IN CONCLUSION: This game is FUN as it is really unique to the games we currently have now. However mirco transactions are really pricy and lack new players. I recommend that they should add more customization and reduce prices on mirco transactions to somewhat a $1 USD for taunts and things. They should also improve matchmaking with randoms and make more servers cause they only have 3 regional servers Australia,North america and Europe. i recommend that people should pick this game up since it is Free. 
This game is awesome. Its like a diablo where you have to reach a point. Also its free to play :)
