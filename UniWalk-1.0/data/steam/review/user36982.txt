played the game on lowest settings possible, looked bad, ran at 12 fps... wow what the hell, battlefield looks 20 times as good and i can run it at high settings with 60FPS, seriosly check out some optimisation, used to be able to run rust (old) and when the new ones came out i still got good framerates, so what did you cange to make it look worse and have a worse framerate. -overall i r8 this gr8 g8 game 8/8 m8, like minecraft but with more shadows.--IGN, [TFTW] Mr.Trollinski.
