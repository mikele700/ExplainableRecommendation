Bet regret. :)-Thankyou gaben
Joined 3 seperate games, on 3 different servers, full of hackers and there are no Oceanic servers, so you are extremely laggy, if the developers could work and servers for more regions and a better cheat detection system, then this game wouldn't be so bad.
Good game, not a fan of normal game but surfing is really fun, if buying this game defintaly find a surf server and learn.
