Two long years I have supposedly supported you,Even when you had left the lane for good,Some days I didnt know why it was so,I thought time would pass and it didBut after all this time I'm still fond of warding for you.Today I awoke from a strange but sad nightmareWhere I was getting rek’d by Bane and Mirana I hadn't long seen, come from the fog of the jungleand in the distance I saw you approaching.So I Juked, Because I did not know what to doI wasn't ready, I was scared to see you fight.But you ran after me, super fed by the enemy’s Riki,Remembering now, you ran as if to beat me.Bloodseeker, why are you such a racecar?You caught up, and maybe I let you.I stopped and cast a few silly spells.You smirked and watched me die.IRL, I told myself not to cry.In game; I told myself not to cry.Why you linger in the jungle after all this time; I do not knowMy feelings are so confusing when I see you, last hits- 35But how do you get so stronk I wonder?That's what I want to say.Volvo BS is OP plz, nerf now
Almost impossible to play solo, and even with friends you still have to grind for 30 or 40 hours to get the levels you need to build the items so you dont get insta-killed by the clans of 10+ people....
