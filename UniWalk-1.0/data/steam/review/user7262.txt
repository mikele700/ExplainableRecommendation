Suits: A Business RPG is a new RPGMaker RPG designed by Technomancy Studios. That's the standard stuff out of the way, so let's get into the weird.  Suits starts you off as The Guy, another businessman in line to join the ranks in a world run entirely by corporations, built as corporations. The satire of consumerism and greed is done well, and helps to add to the game's very offbeat sense of humor. The jokes range from the clocks always set to 4:20 as it's simplest, to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a dinosaur's floor at its strangest. This, along wth the setting and atmosphere is what I think makes Suits such a fun game; it's absurd while still being relevant to modern times. The Payday 2 microtransactions joke is a good example, and is done well. The story itself is rather straightforward; notes are placed around to provide back story and clues and the ending sums up the purpose of the world itself and your actions nicely. Oh, and the art and music. Some people were put off by the crude sketch design and music; personally I found them both surrelastic, funny and disturbing enough that they made a perfect fit for the plot. To sum it up, Suits is a straightforward PRG mechanically; there are some special abilities like a instant kill that only works 1% of the time, and being able to pay your enemies to lose. There's not much that changes the gameplay itself from other RPG's; instead the focus is on the creative art of the game. Whether you'll like this or not will depend on what you're looking for in an RPG game, but for it's price it's got a decent story length to it and potential for follow up.
