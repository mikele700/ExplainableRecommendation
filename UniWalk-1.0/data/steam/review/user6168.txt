I can't recommend this game at its current state right now. It has unique gameplay but the matchmaking system ruined the game for me. If one player dc's, instead of finding another to replace the dc'ed player, the game thrust you into a match with poor AI. I primarily play the hunter, and the lackluster tutorial shows as players struggle to dodge the most obvious charge or rock throw. I tried giving this game a real shot but the poor matchmaking and some balancing issues (meteor goliath being a power creep version of goliath) brings this game down for me. I'd give it a 6/10. Except to rage or rage quit.
AI cheats.Repetitive dialog.Do not recommend.
