PLAY IT >:D.. Team Fortress is a fast paced game that is very enjoyable, no campaign, just multiplayer. I played this game for over 7 hours non-stop and i never got bored of it, you can unlock and create items for classes and play with them on any server. One of my favoutites is the 'spy-cicle', it's a dagger made out of frost and when you backstab an enemy, you freeze them... It's cooler than it sounds :) Plus there is 9 classes to choose from and i love them all :) I GUARANTEE YOU WILL ENJOY IT     :D
