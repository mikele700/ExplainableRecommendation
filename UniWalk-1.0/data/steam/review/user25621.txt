For a dollar this game is awesome, very similar to pac man, but in first person and wayyy harder. Would definitely recomend checking out if you have some spare change in your account. + The music is pretty sick
Great game with hours and hours of story and side quests, farming is actually enjoyable and the story is genuinely really good and funny
