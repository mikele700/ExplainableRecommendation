This game is extravagating. Pickup your sword, bow or hammer and start your journey. This wonderful journey you will embark on. Team Fortress 2 has its good and bads, so does Terraria too. But this game combines both with exhilarating joy and hours of entertainment. If you have not ready you should! You're missing out on so much and the world of KAG awaits you. King Arthur on his throne is waiting for you. The gamemodes are extremely fun (except for save the princess ;/) but it really is amazing how much fun you can have. You could join clans, play for your country, talk with others on mumble, notify on a Kag Facebook called Kag Forums. There is so much you can do in a small game like this.  So Enjoy and Have Fun!                                                                                                     Cheers Lief.
