Great presentation ruined by not so great storytelling/writing which forces you onto one particular path, has not so great characters, and (unlike what the game says) barely has any diversity aside from something happening a little differently and Emily saying different things, without saying any spoilers. Still worth at least taking a short look at because of the presenation + the fact that it's free, though.
