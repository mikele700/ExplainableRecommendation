Great game! Good story, great graphics.. for a old game of course. But yeah every thing is good about this game!Must of took a long time to make since the map is GIANT :3 anyway the cons I didnt like about the game, is that the first person shooting is a bit choppy. But hey thats me! Anyway Bioshock is a great game over all! I rate it a ★★★★½ stars.
EPIC AWESOME GAMERECOMMEND THIS
