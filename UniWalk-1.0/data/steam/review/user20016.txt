DO NOT PLAY ALONEIf you absolutely 100% need to get this game, make sure someone else suffers with you. Otherwise, the difficulty spikes and the monotony of the gameplay will just wear you down.I was really hoping for something good with the amount of focus on the story in Battleborn's marketing campaign. Alas, it's very subpar and not up to standard. I would not recommend this game to anyone unless you were madly obsessed with Borderland's co-op.
I enjoy getting lost in the many side quests in Far Cry 4. I just open the game up, and play a quick side mission to help destress.
