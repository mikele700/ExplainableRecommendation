I logged on and started logging, got chased around by some guy and his pantsless friends, fell in a hole broke both my legs then got my head bashed in by a neked with a rock... 10/10
Just finished it. 2 hours in i was like -I think i get this-, the last hour: 'Who am i? where am I? What am I?-10/10 would flop again!
it was $0.01 when i bought it now look at it. Inflation at its finest... disgusting
