Decent Game had a great time playing it, one of NExons finest to be sure only a few problems i have found:- There's a toggle for aim (hold or tap to aim) but no toggle for running, Ilike to sprint in my FPS  games without having to hold so i have access to other buttons.-Spawns could be better, group spawning is very annoying especially when an enemy has an arm launcher.- Cramped Spawns: A more spreaded spawn so teammates are placed in more of an arc and less of a cluster would be much better since a few of the maps spawns are by far waaaaaay too cramped , you cant escape with some maps if someone sets up a sentry and racks in the kills.Now onto positivesThis is definitely not a Pay to play game I was a low level myself (didnt play for too long) and killed quite a few highly ranked enemies myself customisation is GREAT and weapons are reasonably priced and dont have a time limit on them- (im looking at you Blacklight and Warface) , for now at least its a pretty even game characters are pretty even with no true OP characters as weapons arent chracter locked (besides arm launcher).Overall great game community isnt toxic and admins are ever so nice if your a bit skeptical give it a try at release if its one think that ill give it credit for its for being different with more a team apporach and makes everyone in the team feel as if they have a purpose.
