Game Content : 7/10The Game Is fun no problem running the game able to play with my friend and it is the best FPS game Valve ever make. Downside : Due to the recent update the update of the rank system have directly destroy the community. They in order to manage the rank they derank most of the player by matchmaking them with lower rank people and making the higher skill group player trouble ( Hard to Carry ) If they reupdate :  if they resume the rank system and add more rank to manage equally well that will then be a perfect 10/10 content/overall
This game is fun challenging alot of different kind of map and it is an awesome game this game is a thumb up
The Game is fun and the graphics is a big improvement the control of the vehicle is so much better. GTA 5 Online is fun and have heist that let you earn fast money it is so far the best game on Rockstar. $74.90 is worth but i bought it after the Pre-order Kind of sad but at least i earn money via the heist
