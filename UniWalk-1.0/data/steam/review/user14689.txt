Best Demon Genocide Simulator Ever.This game while not worth at full price for the lackluster multiplayerThe Campaign on the otherhand. Oh my prepare yourself for the most brutaly gorest metal game you will ever play.With Vulkan you can easily push 144fps with a mid range and higher setup at 1080p. So this is how you play DOOM the true way-Select Ultra Nightmare -Classic DOOM ViewRip and Tear until it is done.Quick tip: Do not ever stop moving.
After being perma banned from joining a lobby with a hacker i was mad obviously but don't let the online part ruin it for you.This game is far more worth it for the Single Player and if you dont play the Online part of it you can mod the s**t out of it which adds even more replayabilty to it.Buy for Single Player If you do buy this for Online, Hope you like hackers
Install Project Brutality then shoot some demons!
Suprise, Suprise another year another CoD except this time its Treyarch's! turn annnnnnnnnd the game is unoptimized ♥♥♥♥! if a game is this poorly unoptimized alsmot 2 MONTHS before release  then you have a big problem oh and where are those dedicated servers? i dont see em anywhere at all
