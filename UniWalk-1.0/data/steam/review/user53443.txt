If spending $70 to $7000 or even more to get a virtual knife skin sounds fun to you, this game would be awesome. If you don't think that sounds fun, its still going to be awesome :)♥♥♥♥ Battlefield, ♥♥♥♥ CoD, Counter-Strike is BOSS.
the controls are really fked up if you have played L4D2 before. No More Room in Hell is not a bad game, but it takes pretty long to get used to the sluggish controls and the community full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥s just don't expect too much because it's free
