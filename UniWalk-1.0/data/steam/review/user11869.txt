I-'m going to make this one short and sweet. Falsely-advertised, un-optimized, buggy, no multiplayer, zero depth, terrible menu system, no challenge, a -universe- that is just a skybox with static planets that are just recolours of each other... generally, if you can think of it, this game has done it wrong.Burning your $60 would be a better investment. At least that gives a few seconds of excitement.
