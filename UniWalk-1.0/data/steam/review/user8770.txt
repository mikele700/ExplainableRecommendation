It's a great way to learn how to play Talisman whilst the 1-4 player Digital Edition is being finished, the only problem I have is it's single player
You know you want it!!!
There is only one problem with this game, the 3 machine limit and randomly de registering of my pc.There are people complaing about UPlay being the cause of the 3 activation limit, it's not. This game has 3 count it 3 levels of DRM1. TAGES (3 machine activation limit)2. UPlay (Ubisoft trying to be Steam)3. Steam (unless you get it on disk or through UPlay)
There is one problem with it, if you don't have a TITAN or TITAN Black it will lag the ♥♥♥♥ out
