This game is a far cry from the first game these developers made, which readers of this review are likely huge fans of. That being said it is also a far cry from something as simple as the classic clicker. If you are looking for a strategically competent if repetitive game with a lack of some of those awesome pronz from the first game you'll not be disappointed.Personally I like it, much of the Huniepop spirit is in this game (even the reused voices from the girls of the first game felt more nostalgic than budgeted). I hope the developers take the good from this game and expand upon it while recognising the short comings and working on them.Keep it up, i eagerly await the next installment!
