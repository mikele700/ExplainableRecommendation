Holy ♥♥♥♥ this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.It is able to give you such a nice feeling after getting a kill even though you have no hitmarkers.In a nutshell - The game is just CS:GO with western gameplay and hatchets.But still ♥♥♥♥ing awesome!+ play with friends9/10
Fast to finish, fun while it lasted. Not much left to do once you finish besides multiplayer or co-op.Basically a smaller, more modern version of Skyrim.Buy it only when it's on sale7/10
Beautiful graphics, not many players and some odd bugs7/10
It was better in early maps.The gameplay is fun but only with friends.> Day Z 8/10
Only good for TTTGets ♥♥♥♥ after about 50 hours of gameplay
Fast Paced, Hack n Slash and anime style graphics. My 2nd best option after Vindictus (As I cant play it in NZ).Pros:FastFunSick combat graphicsCute graphicsQuests have meaning and NPC's have voices :DCons:GrindyP2W in some senses...Gender-Locked classes. 
Boring after about half an hour of playing it ...
