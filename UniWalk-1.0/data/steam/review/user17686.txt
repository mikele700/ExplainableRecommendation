Predicting what this will be like, probally better than anything i've done so far.
Its good fun with friends for the price you pay
Dark Souls™: Prepare To Die™ Edition is a hardcore third-person action game based on the feeling that death is imminent around every corner. The game throws you straight into action, whereby nearly any monster in the game is able to kill you in about 2-3 hits. Dark souls is brutally honest through. If you die, it maybe because of a monster, or a npc you accidently attacked, but it's not impossible. It's the game telling you your bad, not it. Challenging but rewarding; Dark souls continues to inspire's us to give a go, die trying and eventually rage. Good Fun.
Starbound has great features and endless playability. The only downside at the moment is that characters are controlled by the game, and are not internally stored on your computer. This allows the game developer's to be able to change, modify and even completely reset your character; which is frustrating after many hours of work put into this game.
Pretty fun
