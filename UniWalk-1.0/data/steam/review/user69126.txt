Not for mac users!No matter what I try, the game crashes after I press the -done- button on the guide to playing texas hold -'em
Recent update has stuffed it up, so the startup screen turns green and the game crashes. I am on a mac. Please beware of this issue before buying, I can't fix it. Aside from that, this game is my favourite game on the planet. It might sound like an over exaggeration considering the game is pretty short, but I love it so much. Co-op is awesome <3
