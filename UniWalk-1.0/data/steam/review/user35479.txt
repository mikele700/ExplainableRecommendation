i can download mods that just turn this game into a star trek game, like i do with every game that i own, because only star trek is real and i am escaping to the real world through video games.11/10

sub-family guy level -Irreverent Humour- written by teenagers. one quest has you drugged and probably sexually roughed up a bit while drugged and then you nude escape from a brothel while drugged, on a cart pulled by mostly nude gimps, and the entire sequence feels like it was written by a 16 year old boy who masturbates to eric cartman. the real charms of saints row 2 and the ridiculous, balls-out actually fun nature of saints row 4 just aren-'t present here. this is the worst of both worlds.
if you don't like this game then you're a bloody idiot
