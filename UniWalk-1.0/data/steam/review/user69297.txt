Batman Arkham Knight Review:CEO: We are going to release a 2.5gb patch to our gameEmployee: And what will we improveCEO: Well we-'ll make it run worse than before and add literally nothing elseEmployee: I said improveCEO: Oh, sorry. I misheard. I thought you said -how are we gonna get MORE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ON STEAM-.Performance:This game runs horribly. I used to run at low settings, 1080p, with AA and 8x Anisotropic filtering, and run at a solid 60fps. Now I run 900p with AA off and 2x Anisotropic, and the game runs at 40fps. Rocksteady need to sort out their PC port. They had to relaunch there game because of the port, and it went from bad at launch, better after an update, to worse than ever after a 2.5gb patch. Gameplay:The batmobile in the game seems a bit overused. It is used for a lot of puzzles, and gets a bit boring. The combat is as fun as ever, utilizing counters a lot. Rocksteady have added some new moves as well. The new gadgets such as the remote hacking device are fun and well utilized, and are actually very useful in many situations. For example, you can knockout a goon by turning on the escalator, or setting off an explosion. I do find it quite funny that once a goon is knocked out, you can shoot them as much as you like with your lethal cannons and guns on the batmobile. Of course they are not dead though, because that would make it too dark.Missions:There is a good variety of story missions in the game, and a lot of side missions as well. An example of variety in the story is  Scarecrow fills the city streets with fear toxin and you must travel around the city on the rooftops. The final mission of the game involves running around as joker destroying weeping angel like statues of batman.  At this point, I have finished the story, and it is a good length. It did not drag on like Saints row (my opinion as Saints row IV got very boring as I played the story), and is not too short like Mirrors Edge (an enjoyable game, but I was finished with the story within 3 hours). The side missions contain a lot of the regular batman villians, like Two Face and Penguin, and involve stopping their crime gangs for good. These are fun, and give you a lot of upgrade points, which like the other batman games, let you upgrade gadgets, and unlock new moves.Conclusion:Batman: Arkham Knight is a very fun game. The story is enjoyable, and even 29 hours in I am enjoying slowy completing all the quest lines. I just wish that Rocksteady would fix their PC port. It makes the game in some cases unplayable, and I will most likely be refunding the game when I get the oppurtunity.Performance score: 3 (at least it boots up)Gameplay score: 8 (excessive use of the batmobile)Missions score: Side missions: 9 (a lot of batmobile use, but feels satisfying to take down crime gangs and villians)                          Story missions: 9 (great ending, and lots of variety. Again, a lot of batmobile use)OVERALL SCORE: 6 (not reccomended on PC because of performance, but if you own a console, buy it on that peasant machine)
Game is quite short (Finished in a couple of hours) but is still very good fun, especially to replay XD
It is very fun, and Free to Play!
If you want a fun game to do whatever you want in, this is the game for you. I reccomend that you buy CS:S with this game, because otherwise many maps you play on or download will be missing textures. The game is insanly fun to play with friends and I will continue to play it until I find another game like it. The game runs very easily, as it is running on the hl2 engine (which is very old). A must have for your steam library, and I think that this game will continue to grow into the future, and will be continue to be modded for a very long time.
