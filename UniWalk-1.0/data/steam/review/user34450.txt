Gods damn you Paradox, you make such great games but you ruin it by constantly releasing these packs for little images when its quite obvious it should be a free DLC.
An excellent game and an absolute steal when it is almost always on sale. Heartily recommend to anyone who enjoyed the playthrough and style of the 1st witcher, with it's dark fantasy, nihilistic choices and adult, not teen pandering storyline. I hereby name it The Witcher 2.0.
Slow and droll, not nearly up to expectations, and they were rather low.
Seriously, why are you even reading this review? Everyone already has this game and you all ready know how awesome it is. Go, buy, now.
An interesting game but not nearly enough play time.
Is that really how many hours I have spent on this game? I think the hours prove just how mind-numbingly interesting this game is once you finally understand how to play to it. Learning curve is big but, unlike Hearts of Iron 3 manageable and worth it.
The game is exceptionally well balanced and offers a long and complete story line. While it does surpass previous installments of Fallout, it gives it a run for its money.
