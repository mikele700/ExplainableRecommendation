This is a game i do enjoy but for the life of me cannot figure out why i can get wolf meat from a bear...and a deer ....and a boar  and even the occaisonal chicken i come across, getting wolf meat from a wolf makes sence...to me!  Anyway you start with a rock you grind away on trees and rocks to get ur resource, you must build your house strong and quick or you will find other players killing you and looting all those resources you so tediously gathered over time and you will find some real pices of s#*t too! just to give an example after a hard time getting started i was lucky enough to have an airdrop right in front of me i go to collect and whilst retreving the goodies from the drop create im suddenly attacked from behind with my screen flashing red with every blow he delivered with his rock i turn to look as backing away and he delivers the fatal blow which leaves me wonded on the ground, as i lay there he then kneels over me and and finishes me by crushing my head with his rock which took several blows! this upset me so i then took the liberty of verbly abusing him saying such things as ur mummas so fat everytime she turns around it`s her birthday! this did not work. but i eventualy got him back by blowind down his front door with some c4 i found then blowing his f#@ck#n brains out with my shotgun!(whom i named canoemaker!) i then waited over his sleeping bag for him to respawn then blew his brains out again then i destroyed his sleeping bag so he`d respawn elsewhere, THEN i took my time looting his stuff! then the verbal abuse started from him. i had tears from laughing so hard. and i guess this is what makes this game so fun (sometimes) so you`ll have to expect that it will go both ways! I`ll give this game  7.5/10
