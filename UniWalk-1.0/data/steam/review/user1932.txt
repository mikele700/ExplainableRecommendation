I got nothing original to say, so here's a recipe for a cake:Step 1Preheat oven to 180°C/160°C fan-forced. Grease and line an 8cm-deep, 19cm (base) square cake pan with baking paper.Step 2Using an electric mixer, cream butter, caster sugar and vanilla in a medium bowl on medium-high speed until light and fluffy.Step 3Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating to combine. Add half the flour. Stir to combine. Add half the milk. Stir to combine. Repeat with remaining flour and milk.Step 4Spread mixture into prepared pan. Bake for 1 hour or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Stand in pan for 10 minutes. Turn out onto a wire rack to cool. Dust with icing sugar.Step 5Eat the cakeStep 6Realise you're allergic and die in an epileptic fit (you were watching dubstep strobing too).

With all the awesomeness and the ability to bat his eyes he became a hero, saving pople like the random woman at the dairy aisle who needed help grabbing the milk out of the cold section (Mr Freeze isn't a thing, just milk). Batman got sick of grabbing milk so he started a business called Men in Bats (MiB had two successful movies and a... if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all). This is the story of milk aisle part... I should've probably called spoilers.
