While you may-no WILL- get fustrated from all your deaths when you do get something as simple as a checkpoint-or to defeating a hard boss- its pritty darn rewarding
Its just an over the top game and it has some weird physics but just make it more fun to play and over all its totally worth buying. I really recomend it if your looking for a fun slightly challenging game with a low download witch ive been looking for lately but havn't found. Hope this helped at least a little.
