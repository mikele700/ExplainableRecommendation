This game is clean, creepy, and fun!Got access to this early (before public release) but from what i played i was a big fan and i did enjoy it.Con: It's very short as its a Early Access title can't wait till the next chapter.7/10 :P
Amazing game! I would recommend :)Don't get sucked into the cases/keys and gambling it gives you a rush like you wouldn't believe and its hard to stop!!!If you want a skin buy it.
