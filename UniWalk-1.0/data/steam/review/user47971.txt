Bad rats is an MMORPG developed by Tesco in the Cold War. You play as the octopus that predicted the World Cup matches. The story is akin to Skyrim or Spec Ops: The Line. With full mod support, a fluent menu and enough action to make sure any Michael  Bay fan would be proud, it really is the perfect spend for your hard earned cash. I rate it 8/8 m8.
Only game I can play on the same maps with the same weapons without getting bored-10/10
Pick up a ho, throw her on the road, and run her over with a pimped out golf buggy.11/10
