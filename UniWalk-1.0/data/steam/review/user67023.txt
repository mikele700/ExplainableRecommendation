This is an excellent game, I definitely recommend itPros-+The combat sytem great and works for many different play styles+Nice smooth movements and such+Well made level-up system+Great community+Good graphics+Good old time weapons+It's free to play and the game is still extremely enjoyable if you don't buy extras using real moneyCons-+Some battles can be over challenging (an example is where i was shoved on a team by myself for some reason, and had to fight off 5 enemies.. This of course hasn't happend since)+Tanks are fairly hard to defeat and/or control+Making money is slow-ishNotes-+There is a bit of lag, but it's nothing too serious, it is occasionally annoying, but still doesn't affect you much. it's also understandable considering the size of the maps, number of player and other contributing factors+So yeh, it;s a great game, so PLAY IT NOW
