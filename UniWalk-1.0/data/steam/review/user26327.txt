Excellent game and the first true fps WW1 game. The game manages to create a true trench warfare experience with the frontlines gamemode. Unlockables like weapons equipment and uniforms are also available once you progress on the game. If you like Red Orchestra / Rising Storm then you should really give this a try.8/8 IGNU WOT M8?
Just buy it.
