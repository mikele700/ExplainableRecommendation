this is will be one of the best games in 2015. the only problem i have with this game is how long an episode takes ._.but i guess it is worth the wait in the end :)
>plays once>uninstalls>stays in library>cries
Good game, Only way I could think of making it better would be adding more memes to the game. Also, those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ grineer and corpus should play nice together in the sand pit.
amazin' game; play with mates, randoms or both. Kill each other, survive with each other, thrive with each other, die together and most importantly Don't starve together...
Very Fun simulation chalenging but still very fun!
