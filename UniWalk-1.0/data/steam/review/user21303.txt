I mean pretty good game, great community. Dont get butthurt have fun.
Game is free and heaps fun with friends.
Great fun game, I found it more engaging than the other one for some reason.
Some guy tried to convince me to leave my life of bountry hunting and smuggling, offered me a new job and some credits to start a new life. Killed him and took his cargo an sold it on the black market and bought a new ship to continue smuggling and bounty hunting. 10/10 best game OCE.
Only reason you would even think about getting this is for last stand, which no one plays anymore. If you like skirmish battles and campaign, get Soul storm, its far better.
This game is like a potato, its pretty good, but not amazing. I like it.
I raided villages for their chairs and fridges to sell so I could buy a hoverbike, best game OCE 8/8 for a mate
