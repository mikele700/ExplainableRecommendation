Bought this game during the Summer Sale and so far it's been pretty good. Just be aware before you buy it that it is a console port so customization is limited but still quite fun to play with a keyboard and mouse. Also, a quick tip, if you notice screen tearing (where the top and bottom half of the screen don't match up) it is because the refresh rate of your monitor isn't quick enough for the fps you are running the game at. Like I said, customization is limited and you can't change it within the game's settings so go into your nvidia/amd control panel and turn on vertical sync for TLoK and this will match fps with your refresh rate. Hopefully I can help other's with this problem, enjoy the game.
