Really fun. spent a good 4 hours planting bombs in an asteroid. Was very please with the 5 second outcome.
Very good game to waste time onPro's- It can ease your boredem- Lots of gamemodes to play and choose- Wide community, massive modding communityCons- Alot of downloading- Missing textures(If you have the required games needed for Garrys Mod (Half Life) You should find playing the game alot easier)
Good Game, buggy at the moment. However it holds future potential
