An interesting game the started from a mere website that thrived through greenlight to become a installable game - Fully sick and Gnarley!
A great game, Iv'e played over 70 hours of it. Cool graphics and gameplay, over 800 items not including mods. Awesome Weapon System, 3rd person mode is avaliable. Several Gun attachments, AWESOME
This game has gorgeous graphics and great gameplay, although it's incredibly unrealistic it was made for fun not to be realistic. This game is a great choice if you can't aford Just Cause 3.
