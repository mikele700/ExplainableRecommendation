Counter-Strike: Global OffensiveOne of my favourite games of all time, the fps shooting game is an improvement of CoD but based more competitively. It has continuous major championships for the div1 professional teams, and the community is huge. Thousands of teams compete against eachother using websites like faceit, esea, CEVO and others, to improve the gameplay and to play competitively. This game is also really fun when playing with some mates, and another huge part of csgo is the skin context. There are skins that you can get from drops (in-game), opening crates/containers, trading up (using 10 weapons on the same colour to get a skin from the colour one higher. Multiple betting websites improve the value for expensive skins and just help you build up a solid inventory.
