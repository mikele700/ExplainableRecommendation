Initially a brilliant concept, working from scratch in nothing but a disturbingly g-string towards steel and iron glory. By which you will rule the kingdoms and any peasents who wouldnt dare cross the king! HOWEVER, the game is in alpha which means that every week a new update comes you lose all progress and are sent back to the prehistoric ages (Literally) because a new skin was added. THE VERDICT! Great Game, needs time (stop rushing good games people).

THIS GAME IS A GREAT COD GAME!Considering the release price and season pass price. This game certainly rivals Fallout 4 which has failed to hit its falloutfanboy demographic. If you want to relive black ops 1 or 2 then buy this game. But dont expect it to be exactly the same, it has differences both awesome and sadening (to see the memories dissapear).The bugs are fixed this game no longer crashes. I have played for a few hours now and no problems at all.THE VERDICT - Worhty, and fully hectic twelvie cod.
This game is a brilliantly made game. If you played Dawn of War and enjoyed base building then expect to be dissapointed as Relic ditched base building in this sequel to DOW. 7/10 for excessive cut-scenes.
