Team fortress 2 at least what i think ias a brilliant game and it's avalability to Mac aswell as windows make it even better. Althought definetly nothing new being released in 2006 and not to mention the time for download the game is still definetley one of my Favourites by far.This game has lots of free dedicated servers, as well as constant updates and for me so for far in my 200+ hours of gameplay contains very little lag. Not to mention still quite a popular game with lots of people playing it even after 8 years after inital release
