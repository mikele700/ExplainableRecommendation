Hmm, I think that getting you pants pulled down, force feed Charcol Tablets, and then Publically Humiliated by humping a chicken is a great way to drescribe the Alpha Release.*10/10*
AWESOME Game. If you are a fan of 2D based, block creating, minecraft like, video games. Then this game is for you. If you have ever played the game 'terraria' you are destined to atleast try this game in your life, if your not famila with that game then i assure you that this is a game that you should buy all year long. Hours of gameplay, rolplay experience, and plenty of action/adventure awaits you in the game of 'STARBOUND'
Although it is quite challenging, it is worth all your focus and patience. Seriously, SAVE YOUR AMMO, USE TEH FIRE AXE, DO NOT LOOK AT THE PRETTY FERN!!!
