Simple roguelike elements with some 'tower' building strategy. Promising and playable!
Go with CS:Source.
Very challenging. Highly replayable. The variety and strength of the loot is motivating and the unlockable characters on offer are unique and fun in their respective gameplay styles. This fast paced action platformer is a real favourite of mine.
This is the true sequel to Diablo II. And, it's fricken amazing.
A very good tactical game and super cool if space and pewpewlazerz are your thing. The big downfall is a lack of sandbox mode.
Made for the masses and wow, this time the industry didn't ♥♥♥♥ it up. X-COM lives again! A tactical great.
An absolute winner. The mod scene is where it's at, too.
The peak of Civilization and one of the absolute best in 4X.
If survival games are your thing, hit it.
