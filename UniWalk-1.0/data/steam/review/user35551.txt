I thouroughly enjoyed this game, finishing it in a single sitting as I just couldn't put it down.  +The story was intriguing +The gameplay was relaxed, yet enthralling +The art, animation and voice acting was wonderful +The musical score was magical!The fact that I completed it in one sitting and didn't complete 100% of the game makes it clear that the game was designed to be playable again and again, I certainly wouldn't be opposed to that.  I really enjoyed it!
