Don't buy it. It's pretty boring, the old Ace Of Spades is better. MUCH better. And since I'm brazilian, I can't play with a ping more than 100ms. And people only play TDM, Zombies and SOMETIMES classic.Download Build And Shoot or OpenSpades. It's free.Build And Shoot is the classic Ace Of SpadesOpenSpades is the classic Ace Of Spades with better graphics.
