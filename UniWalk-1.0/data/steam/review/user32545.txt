This game is fantastic, I flinched often to the 8 bit horror sounds as a scary, all terrifying... cardboard cutout.This game on the first few floors, the game seems cute and innocent, but as you traverse the rooms by the fifties, you start to get a more sinister sense of the game that turns into an actually tense atmosphere.From cute cardboard cutouts to not as cute cardboard cutouts, I say 10/10.You need to always stay diligent and aware at all times, because if you slip up 4 times in one area. Prepare for gameover and jumpscares as the jumpscares never end, I bet you'll love the suprises...To death...
