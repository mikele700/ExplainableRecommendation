I think it might be the most balanced multiplayer experience I've ever played.Extremely addictive, I stayed up until the early hours of the morning for days in a row playing solidly. Pretty quick to pick up and it isn't frustrating, even when you lose. There is a constant drive to keep playing and practicing even after you have learned how to play.
