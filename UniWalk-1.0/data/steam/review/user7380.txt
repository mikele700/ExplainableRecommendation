Good scares, amazing atmosphere. First time you see the alien gives you a good idea of how quickly the thing will mess you up.
Some good scares to be had. Yes it's pretty short, but well worth it IMO. Play the demo first.
Awesome atmosphere and you can really connect with the characters. Just like the show and the commic, everybody is happy and nothing bad happens.
Good story and great fun if you have any nerdish leanings.Kind of want computer that can magic hack banks
