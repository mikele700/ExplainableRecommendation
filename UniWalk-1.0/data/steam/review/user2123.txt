A highly enjoyable game.  Up there with the cinematic Tomb Raider.  To be bothered to write a review must mean the game is delightful or i stepped in doggy doo doo.  This aint no pooch poop tale.The depth in the story alone is worth it.  The newspaper articles are a delight to read.  The characters played tremendously well.  The fantasy created is solid.  The R&D to develop this game is commendable.Even on the hardest mode the game is very forgiving to maintain a high level of enjoyment.  The typical dumbness of the AI is refreshingly old school.  When struggling in a level I am able to use the limitations of the AI to -cheat- my way through.The flow of gameplay is at a great tempo.  The levels of varying degrees never get boring.  I love how the weapon selection resets depending on the story line & the upgrade tree adds that something that makes me replay this thing once I get through.The cutscenes are great.  A note to some with graphical issues - particularly with the win10 upgrade - do some homework on settings.For me, the changing of 3D settings helped a little but the main help was turning off power saving in graphic card general settings - watch a couple of youtube vids and the framerate picks up for this and other graphical games like FARCRY 4.For what the game delivers it is a big tick from me.  To be overly critical would be to expect chicken in a steak sandwich.  If you want chicken then get a chicken sandwich.This action/cinematic game has been so enjoyable thus far.
