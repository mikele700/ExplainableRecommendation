LOL all these angry nerds banging their massive hate stiffies on a drum made out of dried seamen. going non about its a grind game all this other ♥♥♥♥ i dont understang why people are so angry NO ONE HAS A GUN TO YOUR HEAD IF YOU DONT LIKE IT DONT PLAY IT.any way yes it is repetitive and all that i have disconnected 1 time for 2 seconds in the first 20 hours of gameplay apart from that just some minor bugs like texture glitchs and stuff like that but i am still enjoying it i think that you should go watch some gameplay vids before you buy so your not butthurt if you dont like it
To much fun
Fairly steep dificulty curve but addictive none the less try not to spend all your money on skins
So much fun to play with friends
