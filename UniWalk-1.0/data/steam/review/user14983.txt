I cannot even begin to describe my disgust for this game and how badly introduced you are into it... I'm so sorry but I've played CO and NWO and even though it's taking me a little more time to be introduced to NWO... I just cannot get over and cannot express how terrible the tutorial is for STO and it is something I have literally never seen before, you're literally placed into deep space after a quick introduction into the game where you learn how to fire a laser pistol, everything else you pretty much have to learn yourself... 30 minutes into the game play and only THEN did I figure it out that there wasn't going to be a quest to show me when I should and what I should do with my skill points which were barely even visible to notice that I had aquired some, but apparently I ended up finding a side quest from some unkown button that was way out of the way and never spoken about at all within game that actually introduced me to it, but I should have taken it LONG before getting into my own space ship, the tutorials on this game are simply disgusting, the game is full of menus and yet can't even explain a single thing that any of them do.. oh what's that, I can change the name of my colleagues once for free in the colleague information window, yet I press every button to try and find the information window for my colleagues and yet I can't seem to find it anywhere at all! this is one damn confusing game... oh and might I also add that there are plenty of little tweaks they could make to the game to make everything alot easier that even a monkey could think of yet that aren't introduced into this game... overall a displeasent experience, I've seen flash games with better introductions and tutorials then this.
