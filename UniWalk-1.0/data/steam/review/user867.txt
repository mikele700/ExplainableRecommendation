i like shadowrun buuut i cant make my own toon..or pick my own proper quests...and were is the city...match making to fight other players dont really make it a MMO guys...
Good romance but it's felt too short for me, and leveling is quite hard if you dont know how ><, i give it a 6/10
very enchanting and romantic game play, this is for those who love datinh sims and close to real life games
Been waiting for this since green light EVIN gotss me shirt, need more classic like the old days awsome job guys look forward to more game play!
great 4 player fun! never gets old
good co-cop fun ce_ maps are escape, co-op vs zombies and dead players, ch_ is hunt were you vs other players to see who is last one standing if u die u still play but as zombie, and cx_ is extraction were you work together to save other NPC survivers.
