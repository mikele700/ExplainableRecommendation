Head shots make the most satisfying sound!Very hard to learn and very rewarding!If you love FPS this is a must get, not many skills transfer but these skills will transfer to other games!
Amazing game! It pulls on a lot of skills to make a successful heist. You need a good team, a team that communicates and a team that has experience.Play with friends and RP a little! Makes it heaps better!Worth every cent!

10/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥10You have a problem, you only have $10.00 in your steam wallet and you want a new game that is amazing? Well my little droogy! This game is all the amazing-ness of the orignial Double Dragon, but better! If you love 2D fighting games, this is the game for you!
Do you like hats? Do you like updates that only add hats and not guns?Do you like to work as a team?! Hence the team in -team fortress-This game actually promotes team work, you won-'t win if you all play soy, but you will win if you have a balanced team!10/10 hats
This game is awesome!play with friends and plan it out like a real heist and it makes the game so much more fun!if this game was made into a movie, i would watch it so much!
AI pathing is horrible! There's levels where they just stand at a wall and try to jump over. Again with the AI they can see you though anything, even on easy they track you through smoke and corn fields. Just because of this I didn't try multiplayer Pros: guns feel amazing to shoot!! The gun noises are so smexy!
100/10• free things in payday• tight controls• awesome story• amazing music (and I hate this kind of music)• great graphics• fast game play
