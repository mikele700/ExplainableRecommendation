I tapped 2 cans of deodorant cannisters with tape and I blew 3 zombies' faces off9/11 would deo-bomb again-IGN
Extremely masterfully crafted and worth every single penny.First game to actually make me cry in the middle of a boss battle Music complements the whole game so well10/10-comic sans
Imminent tears...11/10
one of the best games, i have ever played
Really really fun and immersive game, gotta love the punishments you get when you make dumb descisions like trying to win a fight with an overpowered group of bandits and being captured by them if you're not strong enough. Really recommend this to anyone who loved Dark Souls or Oblivion
