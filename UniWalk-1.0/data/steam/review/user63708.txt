i played 3 things so far with my few hours experienceTTT (Trouble In Terrorest Town) is a really great minigame that is at the start of the game you collect guns/grenades and you get either 15-30 seconds to prepare the innocent needs to find the traitor/traitors and kill them and you win if you kill them detective is pretty much the same thing traitor needs to kill the innocent and detectives to win Prop Hunt has the same objective as hide and seek (irl) hunters need to hunt props and props need to hide and  blend in with the map you are in but beware when you are a hunter every bullet you shoot counts as some of your hp (health points)Sand Box is your own little world you can spawn items,drive cars,Kill Zombies And even invite your friends to come and playI highly recommend this game it was worth my money to get and who ever reads this i hope you enjoy it also :)
