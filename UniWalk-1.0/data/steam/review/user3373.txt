Poor oversight by Magic 2015 developers in the game.Positives include a catchy theme song, ability to construct a deck to however you like, storyline is not a bad inclusion, opening more boosters to provide anticipation and excitement.Sadly however the negatives definately out weigh the positives.You are restricted in deck building to a limited selection of cards after you have completed the campaign unless you which ti invest in -boosters- to increase your card pool. Matching up against others who have superior cards or/even duplicates or sets of 4 card(s) whom have purchased additional boosters, not only makes deck building difficult, ineffective but also increases the likelihood that you will be demorilised over and over again in matches against other opponents in 1 v 1 or free for all matching.I generally enjoy purchasing this product for the puzzle games, Last turn puzzles a few years ago were amazing and difficult/challanging. 2014 however showcases some very sub par puzzles games and this year, well, there are none.I played one game of free for all on 4 v 4 and I felt so far away from the game table I requested my flatmate to provide me a magnifine glass. myself and another player also realised 4 turns in that we had already lost when one of the players threw down some superior cards for which we had not even access to.This put me off continuing playing this game into the future as really there is no point unless I am wishing to invest into this.Suggestions would be to at least bring -two headed giant- match making back, a level par card selection by perhaps charging a set $15 fee from the start and not this -micro transaction booster option- which is poor oversight in my opinion and perhaps even a tournament mode where equal par magic the gatherers could paticipate tournaments of 10 players etc, round robin to then provide a level based system and a decent points rating for those wishing to climb to the top in rankings over time (by winning more tourney-'s etc)Rating, interface, music score, Story concept 6/10 (as what else can you do with a story really)gameplay campaign 5/10 (as well the AI seems to get the perfect run of cards sometimes :S)Deck building feature, 8/10 as this is very flexibleCard selection 2/10 (extremely limited unless additional investments made)gameplay vs human 3/10 (for the reason you will become frustate that you are unable to build a deck that is consistent without investment into more booster packs)Overall I would probably rate Magic 2015 4/10
