SUCH AN AWESOME GAME. The colours are bright, the matches are exciting and the cars are so cool!
One of, if not, the best multiplayer shooter out there right now. Competitive scene is awesome and is easy to use.
Brings back good ol memories of star wars. It's fun until you meet the pros or hackers. Can't tell the difference. :/ lol
