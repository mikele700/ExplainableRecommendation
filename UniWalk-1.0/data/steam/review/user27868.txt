This game is nothing like red Orchstra so dont worrie about it and if u are getting anything above 25fps u shouldnt complain and as for me i love it. It was 16 becuase i got it in the bundle but i would support these guys to the end And FFS its 3 days out of open alpha
In Other words this game is CSGO for men and not 10yr olds
