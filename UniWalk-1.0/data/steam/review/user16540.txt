Well meme'd my friends.
Still was not completely sure wether or not to buy this game but that quickly changed when I saw the next gen fish physics and tree swaying phisics.
I only have a few problems with Dirty Bomb from the 5 hours that I have been playing.  Spawn campers, Yes, the other team has the ability to spawn camp you and vice versa, It needs to be fixed, Perhaps set up different spawns when the enemy gets too close to one of the spawns? Matchmaking is unbalanced, For example, I am only level 5 and I have been matched up several times with people that are lvl 20 and up, they have access to much better guns/ classes and have much more experience, and really for them it would be a sinch to beat all the low ranks on the opposing team, unless we spend a good ammount of money we have to slowly grind to get the credits needed to get new classes better than the default ones, and trust me it is very slow if you never win a match. I have yet to find any aimbotters but damn, sometimes I feel the need to question it..  also from what I have seen in alot of matches, alot of the community playing is very toxic. Other than that the game is pretty good but these things need to be fixed, probably not the toxic community however. that will never be fixed. For now I will not recommend this game but that could change.
It's an ok game I guess.
Noice.
