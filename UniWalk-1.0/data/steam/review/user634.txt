sooo, where to start.. well this game is a pretty great game, and for those of you that played the mod, this game shows the potencial to be even better then the mod, although there are glitches here and there, only buy the game if you want to deal with the glitches and bugs whilst having a great time, i do recommend you to get this game, however it is up to you, as the game is in pre alpha we can expect the game to supass the mod with flying colours!!!
Without a doubt worth the money I spent, as before, Klei has once again delivered a great DLC worthy of an amazing game.#WURF
