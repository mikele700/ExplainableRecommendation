A far better port than the previous two installments. They've actually given us some options this time around and its great to see that there was some effort put into it. The game has been running very smoothly at a consistent 60fps with max settings on my gtx 970 and I haven't had a single major fps drop or bug or really anything. The only thing I've had trouble with for this title is the key mapping, for whatever reason I just couldn't get it running optimally, mainly during battles but this was easily remedied by simply using a controller instead.Fantastic port, would recommend.
Visually stunning with a great story. A must.
