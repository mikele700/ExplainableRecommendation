Stick to the mobile version, or play it on a Mac if you own one becasue that's the only way to access the DLC (The best part of the game and the only source of longevity past 6hrs). I wish I could've refunded back when I bought it but instead I just bought it through bluestacks. You're way better off playing this on any platform other than Steam/PC.
If you like hats then I don't need to say much.
