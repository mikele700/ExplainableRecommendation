Ok so first off, BEST FPS I-'VE EVER F**KING PLAYED. I played this game as a kid, and i loved it. I think i fell in love with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cover! anyways, onto the actual review...-You-'re the Stranger, a mysterious bounty hunter on a mission to bag the ultimate prize. And you need that money like no one else because there is something very wrong with your health and the only way to fix it is a very costly operation.- Ok so having that goal of (oh no massive spoilers...) 20,000 moolah (yes thats the currency, and yes I know thats epic...) means that you have to resort to becoming a bounty hunter. Now you may think that sounds pretty cool, but think again... it-'s even better then you could have ever wanted! you are equipped with the Critter Crossbow, (and again it-'s as epic as it sounds) a crossbow that fires live ammunition, i.e Zappflies, Thudslugs, Stingbees and more! (i think the names are fairly self explanitory there) So equipped with this ammo you set off claiming bounties and slowly earning moolah... but then some stuff happens that if I told you would be incredibly huge spoilers so i won-'t tell you about them. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who even just vaugly likes FPS games.10/10, would run around like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ animal again.
I highly reccomend getting thas game for all survival/horror(ish) game players it is an amasing game with quirky music and features. I think that the only thing that could make this game even better was if it had multiplayer compatibilities. Again really great game I enjoy it thuroghly and play it daily. Hope this was helpful on deciding on whether to get this game. :D
