High recommending this game. I have spent hours playing firstly the non steam version of this game, and then the steam version. I never get bored with the amount of customization and the various routes you are able to take on any given job. If you are a truck driver you will truly appreciate the realism this game has to offer. Even if you aren't a truck driver this game has something for everyone. The addition of patches brings just that little bit more to an already perfect game in my opinion. If you haven't already tried this game please don't hesitate to buy a copy I couldn't recommend it more.
