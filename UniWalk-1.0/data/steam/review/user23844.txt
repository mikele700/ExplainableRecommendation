Destroyed a great game with recent updates, requires paying real money to get any enjoyment. Also matchmaking is very unbalanced.
Absolutely love this game, every element in it is excellent and well balanced, gameplay is dynamic and engaging. Successfully incorporated elements of both RTS and FPS within it. Would recommend.
Its pretty buggy and full of glitches, but good concept and worth the $3 I paid for it. Got a few solid hours gameplay
