This game was everything that SIm City should have been and more. Sure there is some more finese required but the developers have been smart to open the game right up to the community for modding and editing and this has made this game a step ahead of any other city builder.The only bad thing is the amount of sleep and productivity you'll lose as you spend hour upon hour making the finest city possible.
Easy to fly, gorgeous graphics and a big rush when dog fighting. Love this game!
Four years on and this game still proves to be awesome time and time again!
