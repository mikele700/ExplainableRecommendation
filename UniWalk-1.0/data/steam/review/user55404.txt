Totally AMAZEBALLS! Especially with the last update!
One of the best if not the best survival/apocaliptic/pvp experiences I have ever had within a game. I enjoy this MORE than DayZ and so should you. Its best to play with friends but its possible to make new friends along the way...as well as about 1000000 enemys of course! Its the feel of this game that I love, and its FREE TO PLAY! Its a MUST HAVE!
