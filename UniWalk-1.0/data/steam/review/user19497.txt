10/10 - What can I say? ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Game world looks more or less real, graphics are spectacular. Great story complemented with great side quests, few enough grinder quests to not be annoying, but enough to get a little extra cash on the side wherever you are. Haven't come across any glitches, everything works flawlessly. GUI is also heaps better than the previous two games, menus etc are much more refined. Actually can't think of anything bad to say about it. Amazing all round, must play.
A great game, the different graphics style takes a while to get used to, but is a pleasant change. The story is only average but the missions are great fun whether it be single player or co-op and there are no annoying radiant quests to deal with. A great game overall. -8/10
Great game! The story is ok, not anything really fancy, but the sheer amount of places to discover and things to do is amazing, by far enough to counteract the dodgy story. It's hard to get bored with, and the freedom is great, just drop any quest any time to explore and find more things to do! Well deserving of it's awards and high Metacritic score! 10/10
