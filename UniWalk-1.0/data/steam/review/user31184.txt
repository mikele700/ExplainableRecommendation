I've been everywhere in this game and come across all kinds of players. It's the players that make this game but the rest of the game has a lot of potential and the devs appear to be definately heading in the right direction. Once they overcome some things, the designs they created and the solutions they brought to bear on the game will go towards the improvement of all future games in this genre.Yes, the development seems slow but it ain't. And considering the obstacles that the devs are overcoming, the final release will be awesome.
