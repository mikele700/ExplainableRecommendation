Unlike other people I won't give the s word to activision and will try to stay natural even though I like the game overall.Single Player: Single player is absolutely not ready to play in this conditions. Even though I have SLI 980's fps drops are so annoying and make the game unplayable which is not fair at all because there are some useful stuff you can unlock that transfers to Multiplayer. The story is meh as always but thats just my opinion since I didnt like any of the stories since mw2 and black ops 1. Multiplayer: This is the more important part of the game as everyone knows and my fps didnt drop below 144 as I use a g-sync monitor at 144 hz which is impressive on high settings. So graphics wise it is call of duty nothing so impressive about it but who cares it is par with most of the fps games out there and gameplay is much more important in my opinion. Mechanics of this game are absolutely gorgeous in my opinion 3d battles with jetpacks require more skill than ever and quite balanced since you cant spam it. Also power slides make this title a truely impressive one mechanics wise. Currently there are no microtransactions but it looks like they will come as the supply drops which makes me sad. Weapon progression is like the ordered one where u have to order all the attachments in a sequence which I dont like either. The soldier picking system is amazing and this alone gives a revitalizing impression in my mind to the game. It makes it playable on a lot of variation and none of the matches same.
