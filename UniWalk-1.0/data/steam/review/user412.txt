I got to make a sword which burned people alive while slicing them up.1000000/10P.s. The game works guts, calm down. You just need to set the compatabiulity settings to allow it to run as administrater. It says so on the Bethesda FAQ's.Good hunting in the wastes :D
In the course of three hours playing this game, I was able to:- Arrest innocent civilians on the streets using hacked security cameras (meant for drug busts)- rank up a high score out of dragon kicking people in the face- Bust up almost every goon mob snooping around-Throw a guy into an aquarium- Sing kareoke like a shnub- Drink energy drinks after a long day of punching people in the face- Learn kung fu- DRESS UP LIKE SHEN ZENG!!!!!In many ways, yes this is eastern GTA, but it keeps things interesting with a (almost) fluid combat system and varied cop/ triad sidequests.Plus as I've already explained (in a way) its a fun game to just ♥♥♥♥ around in.Dragon punched in the face but laughing as you fall/10
This game came out only four years ago, and even to this day am I still discovering new quests, dungeons, perks ans items which I never noticed in my first playthrough. Thats what I love about the elder scrolls series (and other bethesda RPG's), in that they are only as deep and as complex as you want them to be, bring with it an infinite amount of playtime hours. Give up as it sucks your life up completely, you cant win!!!!! :D
