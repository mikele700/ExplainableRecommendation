Wonderful game, takes the mechanics of Civ 5 and adds some extra complexities. :)
This is a great strategy card game, it's got a good learning curve though.
Fun hack and slash game, good controls and some creative mechanics to advance gameplay. The story adds a lot of dark humor and doesn't take away from the action.
Highly detailed, well thought out strategy engine. I really enjoy this game. :)
A simple and quaint game. Relives good memories and I like the variety of towers and strategies necessary to win. Plus a game where soldiers are your weakest class makes room for a lot of creativity in tower building.
