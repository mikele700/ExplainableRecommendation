Simply the best zombie survival game out there. Here's Why:- Co-op. An amazing game that inspires players to help each other rather than kill each other.- RPG levelling system and character customization. Feel your character getting stronger and smarter.  - Skill system. Each time you use a skill you get better. Players can specialise and be of special value to the team.- Destructible and craftable world. A voxel based world where every block can be changed. - Physics based world so building and mining must make sense structurally.- Crafting. Countless Items can be crafted from hundreds of resources. - Item quality. Every item has it's own quality rating depending on your crafting skill and luck and good fortune.- Looting. Finding that rare item, blueprint, book or high quality item never felt more satisfying.- Farming, hunting and gathering. The need for food is real. A player who eats well is stronger.- Base building.Finally a game where your home/base is a neccesary to survival rather than an aesthetic.Other games may do some things well but 7 Days puts so much into one game and does it all better. WIth the upcoming update of the world in Alpha 14 the game is only going to get better. Worth a lot more than it's current price. Buy it! -
Awesome, original game, that hasn't been done before.  Not a game for cheaters though, the game rewards the very discoveries that we'd look at the wiki for in other games.  Everything you've seen in prison escape TV seems to be possible.
