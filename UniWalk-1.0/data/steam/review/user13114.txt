This Game was amazing the cars the guns. Especially the Year of the Snake it made me feel like i was in a Fast and Furious Movie!
This game is Terrific, i mostly play this game after a long hard Competive match (csgo). The multiplayer does not have the best community the are alot of bad eggs giving you crap such as -Shut the **** up you twelvie-. But you do come accros some really nice people and they could turn into next freind.
Payday 2 This is all there is when you buy it DLC,DLC,DLC,DLC you require a dlc to play this game But it is very fun 20/10
This game has is Fantastic its not like your average FPS it defaintly has lots of explosions and fire gunshots differnt classes.The spy is the best but the hardest. I most recemmond this game.
