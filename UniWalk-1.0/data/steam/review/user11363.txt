Hello!Game - MyDreamCreator(s) - MyDream InteractiveReviewer(s) - MiKapp1tMyDream is an immersive game; from the splash screen, the log-in screen and to the loading screen, I felt excited. It's a game with an extremely high indie standard, and aims for nothing less. MyDream has many outstanding aspects, and understandably, as it is a new game, also has a couple minor flaws, but with the dedication of the developer(s), MyDream will undoubtedly address these small issues. MyDream is an online first-person world creation simulator with an interesting concept which is what makes the game unique, as users create and build their own worlds and then publish them to the community so others can join and so forth. MyDream contains simple yet decent graphics, enthusiastic music and sound, basic controls and community based content. The main problem I encountered was a minimal to no Oceanic community and lag on Mac, however I believe other area of the world have decent servers and a lively community and if you're playing on PC, then you're in for a good time.Plus:+ Simple yet decent graphics+ Enthusiastic music and sound+ Interesting concept+ Basic controls+ Community contentMinus:- Minimal to no Oceanic servers- Lag on MacVerdict:7 / 10For more game reviews and giveaways, visit Official MiKapp1t's Mates!
