Killing everyone and everything in POSTAL 2 is completely optional. Buying the game is not.
Short and sweet
RAAAAAAAAAAAGE. This game screws up your eyes. MASSIVE epilepsy warning.
This is an amazingly fun game. But it is so ♥♥♥♥ing hard. Still, it's worth $20, and is sold for $10. A must-have.
You could finish this thought-provoking game in the time it takes you to read this review. Also, it's free. Even if you hate The Way of Life, it only wasted 5 minutes of your time. You may as well get it.

Great, great game. Nothing like watching a zombies head fly off, unless you live in Australia like me, where the game is f*cking censored to the point of no control. No limb detachment, no blood splashes on the screen, no blood pools and no common zombies can die 'on fire'.Still, 10/10. Buy it, it's a classic.
