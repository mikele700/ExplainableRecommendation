The gameplay is very enjoyable and the engine provides accurate simulation. It is heavily let down by the lack of optimisation and AI performance. While the desync issues have mostly been ironed out the complete lack of performance on even the highest performing PC's see's this game well under even 30fps. But I still reccomend it if you can push through the negatives.
