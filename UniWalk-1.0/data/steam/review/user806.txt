Nice Game 9/10
Im loving this game so much right now. This game takes the concept of super smash bros. (Punching people sensless until they disintegrate into nothingness) And spins it on its head. Basically instead of having an arrange of set moves you get 2 different weapons. This varies from character to character. I.e, Orion: Spear + Rocket propelled lance. You still have a predertermained attack patteren with light attacks. Signature moves (Heavy attacks) are different. They vary from person to person as well.Pros:-Addicting-Premium currency is for cosmetics that dont aid you-Free-Satisfying-Different game modes (custom game)-Controller support-Very easy to runCons:-Premium currency is used-No Australian servers yetThis game is simply amazing, and its still in early access!
