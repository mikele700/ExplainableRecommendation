If you love legend of Korra this is a must-buy for you, an intense and gruelling 3rd person beat em up. Using all 4 elements to crush your opponents and a special mode called Pro-Bending where you actually get to play in the arena (unfortunately only against AI)
can't stop, won't stop playing this game... probably... please give us co-op
10/10 would play again
This is the perfect ointment for your Overwatch rash.
fappable/10
play with friends and it'll be 200% better than by yourself
Just one of my favourite games :D
