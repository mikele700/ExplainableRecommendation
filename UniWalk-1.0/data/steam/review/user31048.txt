Really good, creepy, different survival horror game. The no save feature, or the save feature being broken is a tiny let down but I'm positive it'll be fixed in the next update or sobut still, this game is amazing, for me everytime I open it and start fresh its still fun. fantastic game, but if you're looking to buy it, I'd wait just a little longer until the save feature is fixed so that doesn't put you off it. Although there is bugs with the graphics and bugs with the enemies its still fantastic :)Happy I spent my money on this :) Can't wait till it comes out of alpha :D Keep up the amazing work guys
This. game. is. goodly. great
