Garrys Mod is a physics sandbox based game. But the game dosent have any predefined aims or goals but to only use your imagination. You are enabled to spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions. This game also enables you to play with other people on 'servers'. I found that although that playing the game is well constructed, that there were alot of glitches and when i joined a new server that most of the customized objects created by people where in this strange purple  material, which then made me think that my computer was broken but to only find that i didnt have the right 'textures' for that server.Garrys Mod comes with 29 ingame acheviement and allows you to be able to enable spawning objects from different games but clicking the controller on the main menu. Then it came up with a dropdown list off all the games that garrys mod can implement spawing in the items from those games.This game is deffinatly a great game to play but has a few issuse so im giving this game a 7 out of 10.
