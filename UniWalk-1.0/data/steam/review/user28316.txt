So far this game is lots of fun!I enjoy building the robots almost as much as playing around and fighting with them.The physics and mechanics of the game (for the most part) are sound, and i try to put as much thought into my designs as possible. I can't wait to see where this game is going, and I am looking forward to more great features.
