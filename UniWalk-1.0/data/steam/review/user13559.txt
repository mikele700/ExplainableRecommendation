Onto a more pressing issue:Someone dumped in the pond
Super-fast baggage carriers10/10
I tried playing this with my old MacBook Pro from 2012 (4GB RAM, Intel HD3000 graphics) and managed to make it playable on all lowest settings but cutscenes got 30fps and gameplay gets around 15-20 fps, which kinda surprised me as I didn't think it'd work at all on my old laptop. Some reviews below claim to get only 25-30 fps on singleplayer, so I still think this is the most computer intensive game I own. (Although, some speech is prone to muting itself randomly, so that's something you'll have to deal with)One deal breaker for a lot of people though: It requires Uplay - and thus, the Internet - meaning that trying to play it in offline mode is pointless and trying to play it without signing in to Uplay is pointless, even though the servers for this game aren't supported. Good going, Ubisoft, I wanted to play your game somewhere that isn't at McDonalds or at home.As for the actual game, it's similar to Blacklist but the AI is a bit more basic. There's no reason to buy this over Blacklist.
Stabbed my friends, survived several gunshots to the chest with absolutely no repercussions, convinced my entire town that I was a Doctor, ended up having to stab them all too.Then I played Town of Salem, quite the fun game.In case you were wondering, the game sees an average of a thousand people on at any given time, so there's no trouble finding a lobby to play with at all. (There's no voice or video chat, though, only text.)On a more serious note, Town of Salem is a really fun game about deception and stabbing people overnight. It is very similar to the party game Mafia (but without any useless roles that do nothing).You can try it over at http://www.blankmediagames.com if you want.The Steam version comes with $5 in points and a more stable experience.Also, you can fund the devs (a worthy cause).
Good old 2D platforming with a teleport gun (not portal gun, portal gun is very very different)10/10 would teleport into everything againSeriously though, the game's about an hour long but that's okay when it's this cheap. It's challeging and fun, the sound is phenomenal, and also it's-- | | | | | | | | | | | | | | /- REPLAYABLE!! -/ | | | | | | | | | | | | | | --so you can keep experiencing the joy of teleporting into lava and dying or falling off a level again and again and againalso, Grigori will kick your ♥♥♥ if you don't spend time looking for collectiblesalso, you will end up trying for achievementsso GOOD LUCK HAVE FUNreally there's no good reason NOT to get this game, especially when it goes on sale.P.S Literally made my money back in steam trading cards, so good financial investment too :D
10/10 would get pushed off planet by angry business mob again
So far, I've sunk 2 hours into this game and I love it. The business model, while somewhat constricting, does not require you to spend money, and you can have just as much fun without it. The player quests are a great idea, and if you get one which is broken, you can ask for a new one. The graphics are somewhat confusing, but if you made it through the tutorial you SHOULD get the hang of it fairly easily. The game's sense of humour is great, and so is the rest of it. It's kinda like if Minecraft were a dungeon crawler, with a few extra features on the side.
