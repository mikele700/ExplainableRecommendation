10/10 IGN. Actually such an addictive game, really entertaining and extremely competitive at times!I'd recommend it to you cause its so good thats really it.
At First, I thought that this game would have just been another plain old Terraria type game, But when i started getting the hang of it, it just clicked for me... I Instantly loved the game with all the Beautiful types of planets there are, Species, Items and so much more. This game is definitly deserving an instant Buy Even in its Early Build! But i know for sure that as this game progresses with newer builds and Versions, I know for sure that it will be well worth money spent :DIf you have spent your time to read this Review, then Thank You and i truly Recommend that you Buy this game cause its Soo Addictive and Exciting :D
