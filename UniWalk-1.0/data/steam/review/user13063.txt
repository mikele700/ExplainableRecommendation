Epic RPG.Pretty much the best game to come out in 2011.Compared to its own series though it doesnt do well.Skyrim has so many features removed from it it wasnt even funny.It was made with consoles in mind and not PC.Morrowind still holds the highest standards for a RPG game.Not even mods can save this game.

Get it for the virtual keyboard. This is currently the best alternative untill Valve or Microsoft decide to make their own for the desktop.
