if you want a new pinoy friend or maybe a few million then come onto this ♥♥♥♥ came that starts with D - D i  ck. Dota stands for D*ck On ♥♥♥ Ass so that means pinoy.
If your all about WW2 mumbo jumbo, then you'll love this game, although it is very recourse demanding if you have a bad PC, I highly suggest you dont get this game if you play on a Laptop because you will most likely not be able to run it, the gun play is amazing, and it really makes you stop and think what your next moves will  be, Im not a big fan of the tanks, I have seen alot of people master them on Youtube and I have noticed that they are 2x more effective when all of the tank crew are using voice coms with each other!9/10

Great game, if you stopped playing this because of FPS lag, definatly give it another go, they improved the FPS about 30%
