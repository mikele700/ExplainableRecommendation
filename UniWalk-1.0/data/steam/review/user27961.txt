Marvel Heroes was pretty bad when it came out a few years ago, but now, it's so much bloody fun. Some really bad pricing regarding costumes and that ♥♥♥♥ though.
It's a port of a bloody handheld game, what would you expect?
The greatest superhero game of all time.
Old but gold. Not a very long investment but still something that I have fond memories of many years later.
