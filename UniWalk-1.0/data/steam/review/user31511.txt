This game is awsome iv played over 5 houres already and i only have one problem. Im finding that you need to grind to get any  where i would like a mode where  can do everything without needing to unlock becuase the main reason i moved to this game from the older game is the car restoration.
The site to register refused to let me applie so bad mark from me
Any game that has a Addon that is a living melon that makes noises and if you press E on them they chase you arond map making scary noises and if they catch you they explode sending u through multiple walls and leaving you with brown pants and a sore throat from all the scream. IS A GAME U WANT TO PLAY
