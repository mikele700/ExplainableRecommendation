First tomb raider i have ever played. I thoroughly enjoyed the game, very good storyline and love the interaction between Lara and environment.  I would have prefered more puzzles throughout the game, as i found myself fighting countless hordes of men. (80% combat and 20% puzzles). However it was fun to use a bow, assualt rifle, pistol and shotgun in combat. I rate this a 9/10, definitely buy when on sale.
