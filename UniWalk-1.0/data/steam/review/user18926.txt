My first time playing this game was on my mum's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop at 4 frames per second.And I still somehow found it fun.
PROS- Had a comp with Laser Dance, Thomas the Tank Engine Theme and Trollololol Song all playing at the same time at deafening volume. No experience like it.- Got called a hacker for one-shotting a twelvie through smoke with a deag.- Got 3 ninja defusals in the same spot in three consecutive rounds.- Free to uninstall.CONS- Little blue people are very much present in the game.- No aim assist.- Can't ADS.- No Minecraft tutorials.- Can't get good at the game.CONCLUSION-sell your soul to Lord Gaben.

And so as the reader of this review contemplated the idea of buying this game, he suddenly realised that this game is actually worth buying, so for no particular reason, he added The Stanley Parable to his cart and purchased it as quickly as he could. This action would not only grant the reader happiness, but will also grant the developers happiness, and in case you haven't realised by now, giving money to the developers of The Stanley Parable is definetly a great idea. The reader, as quickly as he could, clicked the 'Install' button to install the game. After a few minutes and curses regarding his slow internet, the game had finished downloading. He pressed play. 'Wow!' he thought to himself, 'This game is so much fun! How on Earth could I have imagined not buying this game with my son's ransom money. I'd better click that button that shares my opinion of AsianDuck's review being helpful!' And so he did.
Reminds me of the days I used to play N-Way of The Ninja.-We put the N in FUN. And you will add the FU.- A trait shared with Super Meat Boy.
