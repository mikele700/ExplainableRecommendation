I don't feel like writing a review, but I do just wanna say that this is a great little game. Everything just fits together. Definitely worth the behind-the-couch price tag.
A balls-to-the-wall, white knuckle FPS. Letting your guard down for even a second can mean certain death. This game is the purest form of the FPS genre.Don't expect to do well at first.
