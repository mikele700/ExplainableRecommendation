My first ever review,Cant believe the price on this best game ive played in ages.This game, its blance, its concepts, everything about it is beautiful. This is what an RTS is supposed to be PLUS the fps side is an awesome idea great for doing the hardwork when ur outnumbered and outgunned or those pesky aircraft!!To the designer and publisher:dont let this end here i would love to see you make Executive Assault 2. Get financed by a big company but make sure your in charge of all decisions on design and concepts. Nothing needs to be changed the way it is now except for a few buggy bits here and there, only thing i would like to see is more unique content (factions/races/alien race?), more units, more maps with up to 8 player and bigger maps. Really like the feature where u can have other players play as ur executive bots awesome concept except unfortunately theres noone online at least not here in australia. Amazing.
