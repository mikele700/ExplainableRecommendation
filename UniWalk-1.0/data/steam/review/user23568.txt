This game is officially dead. Only US East Server and noone playing on it.
I can see the message they developer was trying to send, but the fact he-'s charging money for an apology seems a bit offhanded. Main metaphor comes of as a bit pretentious. I empathise with  -Coda--'s thoughts on the Author. This really should have been free and not charging money for it.Very well made though.
Shovelware. Do not attempt to purchase at all.
One of the most amazing games ever created! It goes on my list of best games of all time!
