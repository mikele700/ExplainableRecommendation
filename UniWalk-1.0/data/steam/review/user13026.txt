Its a pretty good animating tool for making movies however there are some problems to sfm1. sfm sometimes quits out2. there is too manny bugs and glitchesand it still in beta, this filmmaking device is ok but not the best
-I realy enjoy this game its a small RPG game that it gives you a place where you can explore. I recondmend playing this and tf2 for newcomers to steam
