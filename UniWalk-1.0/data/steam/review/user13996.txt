Far Cry 3 is one of the best game i ever played but far cry 2 is nothing like it, the minimap is terrible to use! And for myself i dont find the Storyline very good... I dont recomend you this game.
The good points:-So funny-Lots of thing to do-no limitThe bad point: -Some lags (like falling out of the map)So i recomend this game at 100%
A simple game, but rocks this game is so gooood althought its very simple! I
super jeu on ne s enuie jamais dessus tellement de mode de jeu de toute les langues mais malheuresement quelque bug mais rien de tres grave
