This game, though it looked worse than Half-Life 2 (which was released in 2004), used to be fun and used to have a reasonable business model.Overtime, hundreds of DLC was, and still is, getting pumped out, at slow intervals and at increasingly poor quality. The rebalancing of the old weapons system and the introduction of microtransactions was the last straw for me, where you now have to PAY for decent weapons with real cash, whereas before you could do a mighty fine job with the guns that came default with the game. Not only that, you aren-'t even guaranteed to get a decent gun even if you pay thanks to the -gambling- system that is designed to milk you out of your hardearned dollar.Not to mention that some usermade mods were INTENTIONALLY broken. Hours of work from people dedicated to this game ruined because of the microtransactions update.This game is literally the definition of anti-consumer. Unless you are as rich as Donald Trump, and or are a Russian billionaire ganglord, you should avoid this game like the plague. (actually, even if you were as rich as them, you should still avoid this game. consumers arent cashcows like these swedish cucks believe)
An ageing F2P FPS that was brought down by its developers through the destruction of its former business model, making it a more pay-to-win game. Severely past its prime, you should skip this game entirely.
Absolutely fantastic. Easily one of the best games to come out in the last 5 years. Fantastic story which depicts the degeneracy of contemporary America, with a great Multiplayer suite to boot. Easily a must have.
Severely overpriced.
