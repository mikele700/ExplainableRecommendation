I do highly recommend this game for anyone, even novice players of RPG's like me. It is in the classic Bethesda style, with little tooltips that pop up with everything you haven't used or clicked on yet which is a slightly intrusive but-not-too-intrusive, well-used way of teaching you how to play. If it isn't in your Steam library yet, you'd better be about to buy it.
