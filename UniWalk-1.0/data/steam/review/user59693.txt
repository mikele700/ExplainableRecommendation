This game is amazing. Complex at first, the game has a good tutorial that explains the main concepts. The game has lots of layers and multiple ways to win, either through, science, culture, and diplomacy, or war and domination. This enables you to not always crush everyone, but to be diplomatic or be more cultural/scientific. Your social policies can give you edges in certain areas of your Civilization, and often one thing is connected to another. More science research means better army which leads to more diplomatic power and so on. Only negatives are that sometimes the worker automation does not work and that one game can take days to finish. Multiple characters and DLC enable endless replayability without the game becoming boring. Overall, a great game.
Great game, takes about three to four hours to complete. It gets a bit slow from time to time, but in the end it's quite good. Not really a game that stands out for gameplay, but stands out for story and content. Really enjoyed it.
