remembering that i said i'd change my review if the game was fixed after the love and war event i thought bugger it, i'll revisit this game for half an hour or so expecting it to crash like it always did after about 25 minutes. 3 hours later no crash, no glitches, nothing. The game runs perfectly. I dunno if relic added a patch in the love and war update for windows 8.1 or something but i have no issues whatsoever. I can now fully love and recommend this game to everyone!This game i could spend (and have spent) hours and hours playing in one sitting, the combat is as satisfying as rts combat can be. Although many pure rts players could be turned away by the fact that large army based full scale battles and base building of the first DOW has been abandoned for action RPG elements like customising the wargear of the different squads before sending them into combat and a focus more on smaller scale skirmishes and a cover system to add to depth to the combat. I personally like this change and it really feels like a warhammer company of heroes 2.Relic thank you for whatever you did now i can play the game
