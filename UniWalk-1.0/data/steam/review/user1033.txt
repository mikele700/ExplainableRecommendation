Firstly im sad saying this but this game does get boring after you play it for 250 hours also dont play alone this game is so very boring when you dont have someone to play with. Second of all I believe that this game is extremely fun when you first start playing because you are in a first person shooter and a class based system which i completely think that is a great  idea because NO one likes playing a world wide multi-player game with only everyone using the same 'class'. Last but not least if your worried about being hacked dont be this game is very secure and believe me everyone I know has never in their life been hacked on this game because it is so secure.-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_Z_k50ltkY

But seriously this game is extremely interesting with loads of different content every day and endless fun. I have really had some amazing times with friends on this game on Dark RP and Sandbox because of people that put effort in making servers and addons.-Confuzzled
