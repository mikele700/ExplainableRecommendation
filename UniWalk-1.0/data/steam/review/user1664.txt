Incredible game but...How long does it take to release an update for one game? When you first made the black mesa mod, it ounly had the first half of the game, and about a year ago you released this, wich has nothing different in it(except multplayer) and you did make a promise to release a full mod, so how long is it going to take you to create the second half of a mod? but great game i would totally recommend this to every FPS fan(:
