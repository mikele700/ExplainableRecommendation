I was Brazil,I had 5 Great Musicians,I didn't have any Great Works of Music left,I decided to do a Concert Tour on the Arabians,I traded Open Borders for Open Borders so i can get my Musicians in,I get annoyed how the Arabians sent in 5 Great Prophets and 4 Missionaries in my lands,10/10 would lose religion again.Game is Still Good thoughIt's best with 5 other people
A friend was accidentaly dropping bombs and blowing up my base.I poured lava in front of him and he died along with me.Some of our stuff got destroyed in the process.10/10 would pour lava again

My Friend Accidentaly ran me over in a car twice,I shot him in the face with my gun.Another Friend took his Alice Pack
This is the best FPS Game Ever.....The Reason for this is because most of it is really balanced and the only weapons that can headshot you are Sniper Rifles and The Ambassador unlike all those other FPSs which you die instantly if you get shot there.If this is your first time playing this game I reccomend you to start as a Soldier because I think he is the most balanced and easiest, so don't play as the complicated ones like Spy and Sniper.I give this10/10
