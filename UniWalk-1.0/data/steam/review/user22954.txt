It's a shame I can't get a refund.
Get this ♥♥♥♥ing game you wretched ♥♥♥♥♥.-Edit: This was my initial thought of the game. Now that they have released the new version of the game I am dissapointed because this was not what I payed for. I wanted a simple survival game that would get your adrenaline pumping. Not a procedural generated map.
Very immersive and fun game
Fun tactical shooter. Bit of pay2win but besides that pretty enjoyable.
One of the best competitive shooters I have played I a while.
Best mmo I have ever played. This game you have to try out when ever you have a free moment. This game offers many hours of fun with your ffiends and even solo.
