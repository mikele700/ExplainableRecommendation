Awesome 2D game. If you like Minecraft,this game is a 2D and more monsters and bosses in the game. more of a survival than creativity
Well, this game has been something for me...I played this game pretty often and is considered one of the games I really enjoyed playing for a long amount of timeThe gameplay is simple, Play, grind, play with friends, grind, get better gear, go to auction and grind for more. It may sound really boring, but the gameplay experience with friends is enough to satisfy your whole day.Why give this a NO for a reccomendation? It's because the game's dead. Very few updates, very few online players also since the head developer left and SEGA not really supporting this game to its full potential, the game became too repetitive with no new contents now and then.It's still shiny, it looks good but the game experience is all gone. Definitely if you want to try it out go ahead, but it'll be a rough time for you to enjoy the game longer since not many people are active in the game
DotA is... a great game. First timers might have it rough with people telling you are a noob and such, but that thing goes on forever even though you're lvl 100+. The game is truly fun for people who knows how to play already because the gameplay is the filler of you either winning or losing.And it never ends! Once you get used to it, you'll play for days.. trust me. Very addicting   8/8 recommended it m8
