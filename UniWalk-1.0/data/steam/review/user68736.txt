This game really does put life into perspective.  You should enjoy your childhood, it is fun, bright, and exciting.  It also shows you that as an adult, you should not be pushed around as much... because if you do, you'll never reach your goals.  Lastly, it shows that you can grow old and you will not be energetic forever, further supporting the point that child and even adulthood sometimes are times to live and be free, not to waste it alone and sad.10/10 for the ultra real perspective on life. and the doughnut :)
Great fast paced multiplayer action!  Work with your team, Red or Blu, to capture controlpoints, defend them, retrive intel from the enemy base, and idol from the MILLION different idol and trade servers.  Play Mann vs. Machine for purely co-op action, then buy a Mann Up Ticket from the Mann co. store to play MvM on the highest difficulty and earn items.  Overall, just a very well put together game, with hats, for free!
