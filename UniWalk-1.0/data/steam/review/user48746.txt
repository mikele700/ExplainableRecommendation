Don't listen to what other people tell you, they are just hating on what could possibly be the game of a lifetime. Bad Rats is a masterpiece in it's own right, some can not appreciate the beauty of such a refined gaming experience. Bad Rats cops a lot of flack because people cannot understand the beauty of it's crisp graphics and specially designed levels for those who want a bit of challenge. People who buy this game are not only buying an experience, but they a buying a memory of what gaming used to be.A gem to be had, Cheers.
