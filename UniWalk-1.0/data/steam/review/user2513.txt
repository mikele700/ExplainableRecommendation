+ Missions are seriously fun+ Backgrounds are good looking and give feeling of the room+Music is great+Having a whole squad of scared cops following order (intimidation system)+Gunplay and stealth+Difficulty (cleaner costs take a high cut, maps are MasterfullyPlanned ;) )|PLEASE ADD MORE MISSIONS, THIS GAME IS GREAT|Perhaps a way to go in loud a bit easier, armor considerable.-Crashes a bit, but not enough to ruin the game-Sometimes pathfinding is seriously stupid-Police arrive seriously early, and phonecalls seriously fast without the caller caring about getting hurtVerdict: Despite the negatives, this game is so brilliant. Ignore the negative reviews and go in with an open mind. It doesn't feel like a puzzle game at all regarding one of the other reviews
Was not very engaging, very easy and and content is lacking, for 6 NZD it's not worth
Played Dota 2 as Pudge, and I was hooked.10/10 would be hooked again
Have you bought and finished HM 1? If answered yes: Buy this game and enjoy!If answered no: Buy and finish HM 1 then buy this game and enjoy!By the way, after you finish, you will most likely be confused. Read the lore after you've finished both games and you will feel a lot better.(Pay attention to every character, even to the trippy store managers and how they relate in the sequel.)
Built a small log cabin50 naked women surrounded itI fought them off with a legI won10/10 would leg again
At the moment, the story mode lasted 40 minutes, and most of it was walking. There was 1 (maybe 2) scripted scenes. It is very barebones.
3rd most bought game, no matches found online.Dead game, and basically just an arena of spray.
Brilliant game, but everything in this game is in L4D2 plus more.
Simply another game ruined by GFWL, a discontinued product which stayed on the games making them unplayable. Well done Microsoft.
Licked a politician and it rained goats.11/10
