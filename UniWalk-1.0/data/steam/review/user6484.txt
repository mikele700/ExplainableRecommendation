This is a great game. It's in a style that'll never be outdated, it came out when I was mid-way through high school, and it still looks good. The music is great--Hyperduck did an amazing job adding ambience to the game, when coupled with the backgrounds, which were beautifully made. Just... Everything about this game says yes. Buy it. Now. What are you waiting for? Just buy it, and play it. It's that.Damn.Good.
