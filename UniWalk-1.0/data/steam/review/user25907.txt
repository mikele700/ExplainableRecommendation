I pretty much spend most of my time  on my computer playing this game. Apart from League Of Legends.This game has a really fun 5v5 competitive if anyone likes competitive gameplay. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to play games which requires statregy, tactics, courage, communication, teamwork and skill. THIS GAME IS NOT LIKE COD or BATTLEFIELD. There is a great divide of players which play Call of Duty (For Noobs) and Counter Strike Global Offensive players (The Pros) because of the huge difference in recoil. So don't try and draw a dot on your screen as it will not work in CS:GO. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED GAME.knife in real life..  $20knife in CS:GO..... $400+Good Luck! Totally recommended. Im in Master Guardian Elite and i really love this game.
I love this game. First i would like to say this game is a continous cycle of Parkour, Killing zombies and doing missions then sleep, repeat the cycle. The gameplay was quite laggy and my frames qere quite terrible so i found myself usually rusty when i move the camera around. Overall this game has got me quite into the storyline and i would recommend this game to anyone who likes killing zombies and exploring the map. There are many secrets in the map like the EXPcalibur which is a ultimate sword which can usually one shot zombies. I LOVE the multiplayer too as being the zombie is really hard but fun.
