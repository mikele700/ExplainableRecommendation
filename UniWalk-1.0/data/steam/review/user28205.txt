This game is stunning, almost like it was forged in the holy fires of Mount Olympus, you will definitley sink many hours into this game before thinking it is boring. The game is truly charming and hilarious until you sink 100 hours into it, once that happens it becomes boring and you only play it occaisionally. I would give this game having played it for a good amount of time a solid 8.5/10.Edit: Can't stop playing... Send help ;-;
