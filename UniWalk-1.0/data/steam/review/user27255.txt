Do.Not.BuyThe gameplay is extremely boring,poor connection with Niko in the campaign leads to very poor,boring missions.They are short and get very repetitive and the city is SO F****** LAMENo car customisation at allStupid f****** Games For Windows Live makes this game f***** impossible to play because you cant save without having an internet connection. seriously,Rockstar what the f*** were you thinking when you made GTA 4 and you clearly were thinking differently when making GTA V,you're employees were f****** high the whole time making this stupid f****** game and couldnt  figure out how to make a game your ever so f***** loyal fans would enjoy1/10Stupidest f***** game everDont buy
Great, awesome ,BEST FTP GAME EVER!  The game has so much to offer at its corrent stage, and is a strugle for new players etc People that play COD Because they can kill people easy, they wont find that here, The Game also has an economy and MANY websites dedicated to its items prices, servers,tips,video and more. The Game is great 9.9/10   PLAY IT
