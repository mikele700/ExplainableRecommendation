Buy it....... I'm not making a full in-depth review. it's awesome.
The best game EVER!
This game is really good. Unlike other open world games that have certain rules, this one particular game, have NO rules! if you wanna crash a jet into a guy while have a boat attached to it? No problem!Just Cause 2 is one of these games that people should enjoy as a whole. The mechanics in here are fully fleshed out appart from a few rare bugs I found. The physics is great and hillarious! instead of realistic physics, this game goes for the funny sort of thing. Going on across the map by car WILL take a long time! Out of all the open world games like Saints Row or something, this just NAILED it!. The enviroments are absolutely beautiful. The combat is mostly good as I didn't like the melee that much but however, I didn't mind because most of your time is either spent shooting everything in sight and etc.This game is DAMN GOOD! I reccommend picking up at full price and I cannot wait for Just Cause 3 to come out!-Good-Great Visuals-Great Sound -Hilarious Physics-Lots of fun--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -Bad-Few bugs that crashes your game-Melee animationFinal Verdict: 8/10
AWESOME TRY IT OUT :D
