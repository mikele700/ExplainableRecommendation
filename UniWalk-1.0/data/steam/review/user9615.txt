No joke, this game is awesome for the stage it is at!If you do not already own this, get it, NOW! Fun with friends, extremly funny most of the time.Only bad thing, ammo is a bit hard to come by for specific weapons, although you can always use your trusty katana! XDGet this, right now.
I uninstalled this peice of ♥♥♥♥ after 8 hours of playing, prefer other MOBA's, Heroes of Newerth may be even better also on top of that the community doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about what you enjoy about the game, they will crush your hopes and dreams.I hope this was helpful to anyone even thinking of installing this.
PAYDAY: The Heist is an amazingly fun game worth getting, but I would suggest buying a four-pack to play with friends considering when you need to stealth, bots ruin it, and is tricky on your own.
