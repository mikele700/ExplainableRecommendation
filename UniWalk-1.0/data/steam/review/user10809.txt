PAYDAY 2 The best bank robing simulation money can buy. 7/10So i will start by saying this basicly 4 player co-op, randomly generated hiests, skills that make players different and usefull, lots a good custom masks and weapons and of course MONEY MONEY MONEY no really get ready to throw your dollars at this game for the tones of packs of dlc it has to offer(most of it is free anyway). im mostly going to foces on the flaws and the annoying parts of this game.The AI in this game OH MY ^%&*ing god is it stupid civilions can just randomly throw them selves at you in the midsts of a shoot out and get them selves killed (costing you money) also cops will attempt to rush you wich would be okay if they didnt run up to your face and not shoot at you. Yea i know some times the enemy AI will not even try and harm you. The time it takes for the cops to show up is a little dumb its as if they are right around the corner it can take them about 30 secounds to mount a large scale assult. I was wishing that this game had more depth but i think i may be wrong i have played for about 24 hours so far basicly i got it sat down and pumped it till i got to lvl 50 (not hard) and found no story and little back story just a really fun co-op game has a bit of strategy which is always nice but i cant see a squael to this game happening because it was not really going anywhere i feelt (and valve cant count to 3) may just be updates and DLC for this game.Off-shore accounts: well you know that 22 million dollars you just stoll well its in an account over seas that you cant use to steal more money to repeat the process. basicly a very large sum of money you steal is transferd to this ''off-shore accout'' its basicly kissing your money away :( i have not found a use for off shore banking besides this gambling system i dont understand yet (you loose alot of money from it dont gamble kids).DLC: I dont really care much for the dlc in this game its just allot of stuff is locked the only snipers and LMG's in the game are sepert 5 dollar packs of DLC 3 snipers and 3 LMG's there are some other stuff but thats just knifes and masks which are cosmidic anyway.But really the good in this game fare out ways the bad RECOMMENED this game
(Four Badass characters hundreds of enemeis thousands of guns and billions of hours of replayability)If you can name a game that has a higher level of BADASSERY (you cant so dont try), with badass characters badass DLC badass rave bosses and badass guns this is one of my all time favourite games if you have it ill be happy to play with you and if you dont GO AND ♥♥♥♥ING GET IT YOU ♥♥♥♥♥ DOG THATS RIGHT IM TALKING TO YOU Stitch. If i need say more about this game the bad guy in this game is for once a real bad guy and you really want to smack him up (handsome jack) and ill say that if a games story can drive you to want to kill a man then that is a 10/10 anyway
