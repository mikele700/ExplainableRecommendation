If you think you're late to the party on this game, you're wrong. The Stanley Parable is a short and sweet multi-ending game that's well worth the price. The narration makes you feel like you belong, and with easter eggs and hidden endings this game will keep you entertained for hours.Transgender Rating: 8/10.
I like this game.
