Being that i have played this game for over 200 hrs over the last 2 years, i can gladly say that this is one of the better games to have come out. Co-Op is fun to do and the game is pretty easy to learn how to play.The Sad thing is, and its the reason i am no longer recommending this game, is due to starbreeze including Micro-Transactions to a game that didnt need them and was promised by the developer that it would'nt be included.Developers need to look at what their consumers want out of their product rather than look at what other consumers of other developers want. Just because Micro-Transactions work in tf2 and CS:GO, does not mean that it will work in this game. Not to mention promises made 2 years ago are still not done. An example would be, Where is our safe house customization? Where are our 4day+ hiests?Sorry Starbreeze, but if you want a good review from me and a recommendation please fix your most current crimefest update. Ps. we really do not need any more masks!!!
Fun to use, Abit annoying sometimes when it lags but that is just the computer. Other than that a fun tool!
