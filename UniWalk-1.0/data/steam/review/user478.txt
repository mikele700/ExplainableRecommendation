i have played around 2 hours of this game and they were the worst 2 hours i have ever spent gameing this just felt like a tf2 knock off
i played this game for 40 hours and then was banned for cheating i have no idea how i was cheating i guess i was to good for the game game to handle :(
i have no problem spending a bit of money on a free game if it is good and yes this game is worth it and it is free so if you dont like it you have lost nothing.
Buys game cant even play it 10/10
