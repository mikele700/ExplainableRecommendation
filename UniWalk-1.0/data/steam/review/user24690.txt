Refined, old-school shooting that isn't complete brainless. Great for people tired of playing the modern generic tactical shooter.HIghly Recommended!
Get this game and play with me!
Well, firstly, this game is deservedly the most played multiplayer shooter on PC. Secondly, it's free to get into, Nuff said, Highly Recommended!
One of the most tense and exciting multiplayer shooters out there, getting a kill in it makes you feel like a BAWZ! Highly recommended!
