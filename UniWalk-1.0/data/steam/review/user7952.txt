This game is a fast paced team based shooter. The controls are tight and the gameplay incredibly fun, i dropped about 8 hours on steam and heaps before then when was in beta. This game is awesome and for the asking price whats stopping you from trying it. If your a fan team based shooter this will keep you playing for days.
