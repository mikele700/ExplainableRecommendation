i'm not gonna write a lengthy review for this game, reason because this game offers me the FPS feeling i always desired but never actually got from any game, this game combines the realism of combat, with features adapted from alot of fps shooters ( cs, arma, bf, red orchestra) and blends in perfectly
This game has bicycles 10/10 must eat, best doritoz
if you loved the previous fallout games, you will love this game, i'll admit that this game isn't for everyone, for example it's basically fallout but with improved mechanics and ingame engine, so if you disliked previous fallout games or haven't played any of the other fallouts before, chances are this game might not be for you
