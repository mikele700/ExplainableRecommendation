I was really looking forward to more Baldurs Gate after all this time. I had some fun, but there is a lot to dislike here in my eyes.The big one is the bugs, including save game corruptions, difficulty randomly flying up and down on loads, broken quests (which required a full restart of the addon at one point), broken dialogue (I was unable to use M'khiin after her dialogue broke to the point she kept talking about dead goblins), occasional unresponsive AI, achievements being popped not corresponding to what I had actually done, and a few bizarre crashes. Multiplayer is broken, and mods are the same. One might think these will get fixed, but Beamdog hasn't got a great track record with these things (I've not once been able to do Rasaad's questline in BG1 without it breaking somehow, and this from 6 playthroughs).I also consider the writing sub-par in some areas. Many points in the story didn't hold up, and quite a few characters felt badly written or forced.Some of the new items were kind of interesting, but seeing as they mostly don't carry over into BG2 I can't really see the point, and quite a few items are outclassed by vanilla gear. I am ambivalent toward the new UI, but I do wish there was the option to change to the old one. The shaman class isn't very good compared to existing classes, and I can't see doing a full playthrough with one after messing around with one.
The fact I own this game will forever stand as a mark of shame
Solid shooter, crippled by syncing issues and the large amount of DLC. Good deal if its on sale.EDIT: Changing to not recommended. They ♥♥♥♥ed it. Nicely done overkill, really.
