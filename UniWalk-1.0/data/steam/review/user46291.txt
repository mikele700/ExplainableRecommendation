One word: Amazing.TBH i was surprised that my computer could such a SEXY BEAST of a game like Planetside.The graphics are amazing, although i can only run this game on high, i still find that this game is beautiful, from the landscape to the players it's all good-looking and goes together well.The gameplay in this game is a perfect mix between a team-based-conquest, team strategy and team based FPS. Allowing Land and Air vehicles to be driven or flown, none of the vehicles feel over-powered or under-powered, with each vehicle having it's weaknesses. Ground PvP warfare is fun and exciting, having to rely on cover, teammates and a steady hand makes this game fun. Although the leveling system is quite slow, and gaing in-game cash [CERTS] is painfully slow [30 certs per 1 hour long session, average gun = 500c] it doesn't matter as the default guns are good as they are. Capturing points is very fun... for the defenders, fighting to the last man to hold that lab is something i find thrilling. As with attacking, after you've captured the point, the enemy team get transferred to some sort of saferoom that you have to unlock by completing a task. HALF the friggin' team doesn't know what they have to do and 45% of the people that do know what to do are ranting on in the chat that, 'These n00bs need to hurry up and cap the thingy-stuff *Gibberish* ' Which the confuses the players even more as they don't know what the hell they are talking about.Things to improve:> Quicker leveling> Quicker in-game cash collecting> More obvious side task notifications Out of 10:8.75 Would prefer if it was a bit more fast paced, but the game is fine as it is.
