WARNING: DO NOT SUBSCRIBE!!Hi guys, I-'m diabz. I-'ve been playing Quake Live for six years but I started playing Quake 3 Arena in 1999.I-'ve been competing at the highest level in my region since around 2002. Check out my channel http://www.twitch.tv/diabzlive to see what I-'m about, and join the conversation about Quake Live at http://www.esreality.com/With the launch of Quake Live on Steam it-'s imperative that prospective subscribers understand the dangers of subscribing to Quake Live.Quake Live has a development team of two people with one supporting staff member. This ensures that their development cycle is slow and suggestions from the community are ignored. The Quake Live admin are also world famous for censoring voices of dissent and employing a fascist ban regime when people give feedback or complaints.As a result, Quake Live is a stripped down version of Quake 3 Arena (launched 1999).It has no LAN support.It has no matchmaking.It has no anticheat (and cheating is rampant, considering the ease with which people can code cheats for a 15 year old game).Every few months, they repackage decade old Q3A content and attempt to market it to users as -NEW PREMIUM CONTENT-.I subscribed since the subscription model launched a few years ago. I have been following the development of Quake Live closely as I am a passionate member of the Quake community.I must STRONGLY ADVISE against anyone subscribing to Quake Live due to the lack of content, lack of updates and fascist admin.Don-'t fall for it!EDIT: All of the features and content of Quake Live plus LOADS more can be purchased all for a once off price here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/2200/
