Generally i cant be ♥♥♥♥ed to write a review, however the kind people who bring us Payday2, Overkill Studios have royally ♥♥♥♥ed this and the loyal community it grew since release.Now I can see people asking whilst reading this, how can someone with over 1330 hrs played give it a negative review, well firstly let me say that Overkill got it almost right, a relatively cheap game, loads of original content, quality updates for the most part this lasted bout a year, 18 months at the most.So after that period there was a systematic decline in quality, maps were broken, guns were unbalanced, and countless paid DLC were utter trash even Lion Game Lion couldnt even get their ♥♥♥♥ together.That basically brings us to now, 38 DLC later 2/3 of it are useless DLC majority of which are $5.99 and not worth a dime. The most interesting and enjoyable parts of the game are easily the base components(missions and weapons) and free heists. But finally not only did OVKL run this into the ground at the speed of light but now they're trying to be CS:GO by adding weapon skins just instead of opening crates with keys you open safes with drills.If i have wrote this about a year ago i would have said buy it, its 100% worth it, but now avoid at all costs
