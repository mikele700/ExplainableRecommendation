Got the game a few months back, I was impressed. Pretty good controls, good gameplay, damn realistic (in a good way). I liked it.A few months later, I play again. I'm at the menu, make a game for NMO_Cabin and it starts loading...Five minutes later, loading...I Ctrl+Alt+Delete, it doesn't load. Try again, it finally pops up and I open Task Manager but it doesn't leave the game for a good 30 minutes! And when it does and I try to get rid of the game which is practically FROZEN, it doesn't get rid of it until I actually stop the HL2 Process. Is anyone else having this problem or is it just my damn computer?
