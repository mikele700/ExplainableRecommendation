This game is soooooo bad. You go around houses finding stuff while these floating -demon- things spawn outta nowhere and get you in the back. Its so god damn annoying when you go into a house, lock the door behind you then all of a sudden, you-'re being attacked by the ugly bugged out enemies. And yeah they stuffed up the name of something: 'Devils Share- like they share things between devils, like they are caring devils, instead of -Devil-'s Share-. Its just the worst, an abomination. Not even worth the 50 cents i paid for it. Just go buy 20 copies of bad rats for your friends instead
Montaro is the a combination of the psychological horror of Silent Hill and the social commentary of a Metal Gear Game.
This is not a 'game' for everybody.Honestly, I have a hard time calling this a game in a tradotional sense. To me, The Beginner's Guide feels like a walk through a gallery where you are able to have a brief look into the artist's motivations.This game doesn't have mindblowing gameplay but what it does have is an excellent story and truely creative environments. Davey has put together an experience that has the ability to tell a story that will leave you looking back on it for days.It has stuck with me since my first playthrough and I can't reccomend it any more to anyone who seeks story rich gameplay over all.
10/10, Zero Flaws
