Well i mean in one point of view i will say that this game is fun and the gun play in enjoyable even tho quite generic. And in the other point of view i will say that i could have enjoyed the game much more if i had managed to play it for more than 5 minutes without my computer having a stroke. Maybe its just me and im being too harsh but regardlessThere are lots of technical issues with this title that need to be fixed and im sorry but i cannot recommend this game.
This game is basically counter strike with hot waifus and ten times harder. Ash is my waifu She is mine Nobody elsesI called dibs on her first. Yall can ♥♥♥♥ off.
Call of duty modern warfare 2 is probably the most call of duty game  call of duty made. Its so Call of duty that you can almost taste the 8 year olds banging your mother.This is like the quintessential Call of duty Save all your money and just buy this game instead of the other seven hundred thousand entries because this is as good as it gets.
I can confidently say that this is pretty much the best DLC in the entire seriesIf you have to buy ONE DLC you have to get this one. Even tho that i have to warn you that some of the jokes are pretty cringe worthy but if you have played through BL2, im pretty sure you have already gotten used to it by now.
Even tho i personally suck at this game i still love how insanely difficult and yet fun to play it is. I have played for atleast 20 hours and i havent got to private.10 outta 10 will recommend.
Thanks to this game i have an never ending desire for space ninja booty.10 outta 10.
One of the best co-op experiences i've had in a while. You feel the adventure You feel the community and most of all you feel the friendship when you help eachother through hard times. Best game to appreciate friendsOr to figure out if they are actually your friends and not just ♥♥♥♥♥ to go to the other side of the map and make a ♥♥♥♥in camp for themselves. ♥♥♥♥in ♥♥♥♥♥10 outta 10
