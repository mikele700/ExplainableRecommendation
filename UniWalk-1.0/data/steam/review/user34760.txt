Fractured Space is a 5v5 space third person shooter which has gripped me in suspense when i havent been losing too badly. This game is still early access so there is plenty more to come, but I enjoy this game in its current state. Probably a 8/10 and could turn out to be a 10/10 in the future.
oh god please play this game
Great game, great stealth, great combatGot it all, just about10/10
