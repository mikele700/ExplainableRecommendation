You drive a truck
im not great at this game but wow can i reck noobs.So Brawlhalla is a really good brawl  em up/ super smash bro type game. For everyone i knew and recommended it to( and actually played the game) all of them liked it.All of the other games that try and recreate this fail. Brawlhalla is a game which i cannot write a good review about.Damn me, back at it again with the brawler games.why do i still write bad reviews.
Rocket League. The game where i can fly but also not fly. it is to fly or not to flyor just the game that i played for well not enough time
RUNNING WITH RIFLESi get a gun. i run.i die. i get a gun. i run. i take cover.i peek around corner. get a 400 collat. go back. peek back. notice i forgot to reload. i dieREPEATign/10
GUNPOINTThis game holds me at Gunpoint at every cornerso gunpoint a stealth hacking game. Thats my game now. I can jump on someone and then break their face. DAMN. i can jump through glass. HOLY. I get a gun. DAMN DAMSDUWMASNDIWdunsadinwau( heart attack noises). I can kick a door.mmmmmmmnmmmm hhhhmmmmmm.Overall this is a gr8 game ( i recovered from the heart attack).
DIRTY BOMBthis game is now my mainstream game with gr8 graphics and great gameplay. Theres so many great features in this game such as NO RUSSIANS...Thats not all why i play dirty bomb its also since theres no one saying Blyadvik...
This game i played over 8 times and felt it in a different way every time and bought dlc and played some more greatest game. Let me try this in real life...move sword up...slink.... neeh naaah neeeh naah, shots fired.....another bad review  :|
