Very broken. Tried all the debugging and support but simply will not run (Win 10 AMD 7970HD). Will consider rebuying once it becomes more stable but for the moment, maybe not worth the purchase :(
Lots of fun and very polished, even it's current state. The devs update their blog everyday with what they have done and the effects on the game. Definately worth checking out.
