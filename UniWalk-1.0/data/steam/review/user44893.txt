A Wardog lunged at my car from another car, I drove back so he missed, as he was in the air a car comes and runs over him
I jacked off to Gortys voice so hard
Man looked directly at me. I looked him dead in the eye for a solid five seconds before walking away under a table to snipe him with a crossbow
