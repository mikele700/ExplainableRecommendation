If this game was a potato, it would be a great potato.
First of all, this game should be used in schools becuase it shows kids how to either prevent bullying, sexual harrasment and other offences. On a survay of the people who lern't how to protect them selfs from pedos, 11/10 would use a katana to protect themselfs. On a survay of people who lern't how to prevent bullying: 11/10 whould shoot again. On a survay of dirty minded, 22/10 in-to-game-characters would bang again.
Game that is good enough to wank to.But couldn't find duct tape anywhere so I couldn't recreate my hostage taking.Garry pls fix.
