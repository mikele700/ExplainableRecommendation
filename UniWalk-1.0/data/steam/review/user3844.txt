If you go into this game expecting great gameplay and game mechanics, you will likely not enjoy this game. This game will be driven by the amazing story and, for me personally, the amazing music. While this was a quick game, under five hours long, it was an incredible experience that will stay for a long time. The ending was emotional, the way the story was told was well thought out, and, overall, it was a well-made game.10/10
Great Game, Good community and hats galore. Most importantly, good shotting mechanics. 9.5/10
