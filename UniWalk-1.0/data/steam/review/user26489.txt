I haven't played that long of it but I can say that this is a really great game. Yes you will have to grind but it doesnt take ages to level up, I played for 4 hours and got 3 levels, I think that is a steady pace to go. And the guns are expensive, but the point of the game is to get something your comfortable using and you will make more money off of it, like a jeep when you are able to spawn it in game you get an instant 1350 in game points to spend plus all of the other points you get through the game. This isnt a pay to win game, its a pay to level up faster, you can get everything by unlocking it by playing the game, whats the point in getting a game and buying everything.... what do you do then.... It has beautiful maps and a great engine to play on. I highly recomend this game to those who wants to play a game that invloves teamwork and are into WWII styled games. So far I've had a blast with it
