What the hell is Square Enix doing? They make this incredible game that is eaisily as good as (Or better than) the latest Final Fantasy, Murdered Soul suspect or Lara coft and don't give it any publicity. Honestly, if my friend didn't tell me about this game i would have missed out on a gem made by a triple A studio, a rare thing in this day and age.
