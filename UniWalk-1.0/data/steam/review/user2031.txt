I got a goal with a Delorean then proceeded to do backflips while flying.Why haven't you bought this game yet?
The only thing I don't like about this game is that I can't get Shovel Knight's hat in TF2
I shot a spy who was also a crab with a minigun until he became a croissant and backstabbed me in the face.10/10 would gibus again.
The antagonist is Watchmojo.Can a game get any better?
I told a skeleton that I didn't eat his spaghetti then we went on a date.11/10 too much nyeh heh heh
