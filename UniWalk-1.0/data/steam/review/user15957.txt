This game has great art direction, an immence plot and a fixed atmosphere. Sure it can be boring with long as dialogue, but that-'s what to expect in visual novel games.Also, why does -being a furry game- make it need to be hated? There are worse fandoms guys, seriously. Enough picking on the big fan bases, Especially the furry fandom and Major/Minor.Rating: 8/10 Hesk ButtsNote: This will most likely be the only time I actually be serious in my reviews, so let-'s say it-'s a -rare occurance-.

It's like that one episode from The Simpsons where Smithers and Mr. Burns played car soccer... BUT WITH ROCKE- basically, unoriginal idea made pure original, in my opinion.Rating: 10/10 Rocket Footballs
