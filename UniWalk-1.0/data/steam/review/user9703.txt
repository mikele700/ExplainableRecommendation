Great game if you want to make money when it was 14 cents. Otherwise, the gameplay mechanics are too old/crap. I didn't like it anyway.There are better things to spend money on.
a kind of fun game, but eh. Watch gameplay videos before buying it - i got this as part of a bundle code, so it was cheap for me. So I don't care too much about the money I spent.I have no idea what I am doing in the gameplay. Your objective is to create a specific particle, while as a particle of yourself, so you use spacebar to push away particles attracted to you and try not to touch your opposites because you'll be annihilated in that case. I like the concept.Unfortunately... I don't know wtf I'm doing, pressing shift to... degrade my particle? which can then be used to upgrade other particles... Eh. What I remember from last year when I last played this was clicking on skip level because I wanted to find the story line and stopped caring about the gameplay. It's ok, but I did not find it satisfying.Different people will like different games I suppose, this is not one I like and at 15 dollars... It's polished, it's got a good menu interface and looks well, no bugs or glitches that I've found...But it wasn't fun for me, and for the price it is in store I wouldn't get it. 
Nice feels trip you go on if you watch/read this VN. I recommend because it is a good polished VN with a feels trip.10 dollars may be a bit much, it's a bit short. But it's a good read.
