In no other online multiplayer game have I tried so hard to actively avoid the multiplayer element of the game.  The whole time you're playing, there's just that little bit of background tension, generated by nothing more than knowing that they're out there somewhere.  No matter where you are, someone could be watching you down their sights.  At any time, you could die a quick and unexpected death.  The sound of gunfire is no more harrowing than the sound of footsteps outside the building you're in, or even the unexpected sound of a Zluta being cracked open nearby.  That's usually when I back myself up into the corner of the room, aim my gun at the door, and wait - all the while my heart pounding away in my ears.And when someone does open that door... well, that's when it gets really interesting.
