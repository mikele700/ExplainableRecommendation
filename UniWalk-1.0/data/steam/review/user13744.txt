Ark is a awesome game to play with friends, for being in it's Beta/Alpha stages it is a good catch. There are also bad things in ARK which I think should be changed or deleted.First off the good things. What I like about ARK is it's open sandbox. You can go around exploring the island that you have been stranded in and discover new things. Another I like about ARK is the gameplay. Taming dinosaurs, raiding, hunting, the number of things go on. It gives a big viarity of things to do, especially the big range of dinosaurs you can tame which more are being added by the minute. Another thing I like is the constant updates. The developers seems to update the game a lot and add new content such as new dinosaurs and weapons and much more. Now the things I don't like. First off raiding, it seems to be too easy for people who have grenades to destroy and raid bases in an instant. Even the dinosaurs inside can't stop them. I think they should give defenders the upper hand in the battle for a base, because no one likes to rebuild their base every day. One thing I think they should work on is a bit of optimization on a game. Most people can't run ARK at all, and quite a bit of people run the game but have bad FPS. I don't see anything else bad about this game. Just the two optimizations and raiding. I really do recommend getting this game to help out the develpovers make this game ever better then it is right now. And hey! Make a review like I've done so they know what they need to work on/add.
