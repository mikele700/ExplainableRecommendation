This is one of those games that is for those that have patience. It's a good game to play when your absolutely bored, and just want something to challange your brain.
After winning this in a giveaway (in which everybody won because 20k entries for 50k copies), I decided to give it a shot. And boy do I regret it.The main cons I can think of include: Crappy hitboxes (you will die if even in proximity to most things, including landing 'safely' corner above) The confusing story (so...you're a spirit in some hell-like demention or something? But you're a box? I'll be honest, I'm trying to recall it right now.) Awful resolution (most of words will fall off screen on a standard 1920x1080) The options menu (Very lacklustre, includes 'Blood', 'Effects (which I don't know what that means) and another unknown option)The only pro is that it likely is impossible, 200+ deaths and only got past level 2. Though again, mostly because of the hitboxes.
The way the gameplay sets out is unique yet remincent to older retro games. Humour is to be had in the majority of the conversations, and rich with quirky tropes within the many NPCs. It calls into question old logic, while bringing its own chaos. The different guidelines in playthrough styles allows one to easily differentiate between the two, instead of just a touchup of color and a witty remark. Not only that, one is able to easily suit into a styling of their choosing, the passive being light-hearted and compassionate,  while the violent taking a frustrated and disconnected attitude (This could be seen negatively in the case of frustration, but meh. You'll deal with it)If you want to take a jab in the feels, I would recommend.If you want to embrace all the friends around you, I recommend.If you want to slaughter a land you know only a brief amount and the humourous inhabitants, I (reluctantly) recommend. (The killing part, not the recommend part)Though I must warn you...   You're in for a bad time.
