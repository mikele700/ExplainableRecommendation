i played one match and now i cry myself to sleep10/10
keeps on crashing when i start a gamejesus is telling me something
this was my first game on steam, recommended to me by my friend. what i played then i thought was prettey trash, but i was playing with bots, so that's why. once i joined my first server i was greeted fairly pleasantly by people who had hats. i wanted to be them, so i bought some stuff. got some hats, and look where i am now because. I HAVE HATS. 14/5 it's pretty oki'm also broke. but that doesn't matter
