Aside from me not understanding a bit of the story in this game (I can it was religion-related), the gameplay objective is incredibly simple, and the art for this game is just pure amazing. Would recommend this game for anyone who would like to trade thirty minutes for a calming experience. Once again, the art for this game is just BEAUTIFUL.
