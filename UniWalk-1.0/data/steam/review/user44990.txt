Very silly, very fun. The dictionary is pretty good, but it-'s missing quite a lot (come on 5th Cell, -fedora- should be a word, I want to make all the characters look like euphoric neckbeards) but the challenges are very clever and some of the solutions are a blast. If you want a bit of a relaxing game this is a good place to go.
