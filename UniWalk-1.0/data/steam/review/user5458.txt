Made Batman slide up stairs... 10/10
Alright so I played TFTB today and I have to say that was friggin amazing, compared to TWD and TWAU, this had a much lighter tone where it let a lot of the famous Borderlands humour into it, and in all honesty I think this was funnier than the actual Borderlands games themselves, great moments in this that are easily memorable, the big plot twist near the end I kinda saw coming about 10 seconds before it happened but the gameplay was really a step up, both Fiona and Rhys play differently (kinda) introducing a sort of new mechanic with each person, I did kinda notice a few more qte's but I didn't mind that also a lot of reference to the other Borderlands (mainly Borderlands 2 and its dlc) but yeah I enjoyed it and am now restlessly waiting for ep 2 :D
