Look people, I truly believe that this game is one of the most fun and immersive FPS' that I have had the fortune to play. Insurgency offers a intensive and engaging experience while maintaining a certainly realistic simulation. As a break from the juggernaut hyper-Realistic games such as Arma, Insurgency shows that complex keyboard mapping and hyper realism is not the only thing needed to maintain fidelity to realism.Insurgency is a good game, 8/10.
