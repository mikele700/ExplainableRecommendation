This Game Is Terrible. the gameplay is terrible and multiplayer is impossible because there is no possible way to find friends, it is entirely unfriendly to new players who get shot down just so the more experienced can steal their torches and in my very honest opinion I feel as though I should get a refund with the included terrible quality of the game for 20 dollars.
finally got 100% on this game, I would highly recommend the game, has an amazing and unique graphical style even those who aren't fans of the series can pickup the game quickly and enjoy gameplay that never seems to get boring with such an exciting pace
