Its a great game with great graphics and good gameplay. It is a bit hard for the newer people since they will struggle to learn the basics. its a good try since its free so give it a go.
great game. so addictive and actually requires tactics in the way you construct your robot. although i wish you would add more game modes/objectives rather than capture the base only and add more maps. besides that its a great game.
