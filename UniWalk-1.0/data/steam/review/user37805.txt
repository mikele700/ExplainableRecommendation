An absolutely superb effort and indispensable for any Deus Ex fan. This mod perfectly updates the original without sacrificing anything, allowing this classic experience to be brought to a whole new generation of gamers, while retaining everything long term fans adore. A wonderful way to keep DX alive, and so very respectful and reverential to the original. Amazing work -- I'm addicted.
Bought this game in 2000. I'm still finding new areas, conversations, documents and easter eggs. Best game ever. 10/10.
