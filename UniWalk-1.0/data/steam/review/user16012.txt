This game is excellent, pure and simple It can be played easily both with a keyboard and gamepad A great port of the original game this is a real blast from the past and is worth every cent if it’s on sale it’s a must add to your library I can come back again and again to keep playing to get all 180 emblems which isn’t as simple as one would think.
It's good, not great if you can get it on sale its worth the once though the story though linar is still deeper then CoD game
