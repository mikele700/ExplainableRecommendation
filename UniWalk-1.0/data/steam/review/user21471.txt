It's a Platinum Games product. That's how you know it's quality.
Words can't express how pleasing this game is to me.  Please  make more, id.
What a coinkydink, this game is similar to what comes outta my pie-hole when my diarrhea starts acting up! This game is absolute ♥♥♥♥, and with what has been going on with their stolen models, I'd recommend my bowel movement products over this.
Pretty rad game, haven't really played Melee much though.
