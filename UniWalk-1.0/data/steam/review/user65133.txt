Fun game, but literally another shoot em up game with a little team play put in the mix, its not easy to get good but its not hard to drop a whole team. the community is full of scammers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. i like the game but dont play it anymore because of the community and overall players of this game.i recommend if u can put up with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and idiots 24/7
If you like team based strategy games. this is the ultimate version. if you prefer being a lone wolf. dont even download it. overall fun game. would reccomend it.
Good Game, hours of fun, not really pay to win, more like pay to get better stuff faster.., pvp is okay.. some heroes are a little broken, overall id recommend it, my hours should prove i know a bit about the game, maxx lvl candy bard, lunar lancer and fae trickster.
has a few problem... i havent even been able to play it.. when i launch it the game goes black screen and plays music but does nothing. but i have played it on my chrome book before the hacker killer fixes and it seemed fun :D thumbs up from me
