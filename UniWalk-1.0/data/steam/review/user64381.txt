This game is great it has everything a good, crazy FPS like TF2 could offer.It has the good mix of crazy with call of duty and batman.The only thing is THERE IS NO-ONE and i mean NO-ONE in the lobbies.I havent played the game in multiplayer yet thats how deserted this gane is. So if you can advertise this game more then it could be better. I would rather have full game servers than empty ones. :P
great game i love it
