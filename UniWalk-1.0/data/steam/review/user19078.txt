Pretty damn fun game. Many players have had memoriable moments in this game....This game has very awkward controls, but thats the whole point of the game; I mean, where else can you discover breakdancing drills and last-second traitorous green syringes???8.1/10
This game is worth your money: fast-paced FPS, a good variety of guns and enemys, the most fun out of headshots evar and an awesome boss at the end of each game.it is worth the cost!!
See that episode of GG that reviewed this game to see how good it is4/5
A complete and exelent 2d side-scrollin game. Reccomended to many.
