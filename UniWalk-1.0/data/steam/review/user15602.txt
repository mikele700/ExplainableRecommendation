I played a version of this game almost 11 months ago, at Digital Nationz 2014. Out of everyone at the convention, I was the only person able to beat all the levels available at the time. despite this, it took be the better portions of both days for me to achieve that. With this latest version, i have yet to even get past the second level. Eyemobi have made a really great horror game, that plays on your Fight or Flight response, every second you spend in the game. Additionally, This game has become the highest rated Horror Game to come from a New Zealand based developer, which, as a New Zealander, is something that just makes you want to love the game anyway.Also. Spiders. Its always the Spiders.OFFICIAL RELEASE UPDATE:A whole lot harder, a whole lot scarier. The developers have made great strides in the quality of their game over the past year. Game has more options, animation is much smoother, and the random level generation algorithms are no longer occasionally sticking me in the walls. There are so many poor quality survivial horror games that have come out the past few years, but i can say with all honesty that this is one of the best the genre has to offer.
Because of Fallout 4, Im probably going to fail my first year at University. GG Bethesda.
Do you recommend this game?: Yes
One of the best Star Wars games from my childhood.Don't care about the fact that I needed a 3rd-party Patch to run it.That shouldn't be a reason to not recommend this game.
