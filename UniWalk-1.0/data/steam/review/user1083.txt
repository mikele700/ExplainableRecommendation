yeah DayZ is pretty good ;)
A very nice Hearts of Iron clone, that is great for people new to the grand strategy genre. Invading a country and defending  is really rewarding. Interface is clean and doesn't have as much overwhelming clutter like in Hearts of Iron.The game itself is only $5, if you're a big fan of WW2 history or just history in general, its worth having it in your game library.
This game is not worth playing anymore, ranking system is ♥♥♥♥ed now, I loose one game and instant derank, weapons have been tampered with too much, smurfs are everywhere etc.Sure use to be a good game, but CSGO has had its face ♥♥♥♥♥ed on for 2016
