5yearolds/10
I played a mathara confederacy (spelling) and defeated the mughals, i then proceeded to take the middle east and go north through the caucaus, defeating russia with sweden. I gave sweden sri lanka earlier but then i realized i needed that to win so i broke our alliance and took it back, me and sweden are now worst enemies and im taking the balkans with my army of european-indian soldiers. 10/10 would ♥♥♥♥ sweden again
pretty gut
its a bit hard at first
Bought this for me and my friend on sale, thought there was co op, there isnt its only splitscreen.
not as good as fallout: new vegas but still a good game in its own right.
I have a friend i play this with but multiplayer is pretty boring alone, the community is dead.
DLC/10
not bad
