Fast paced, objective based, teamwork and skills. Outplay the enemy team and sink them deep. Thumbs up for Dirty Bomb. Although it's currently in beta, with a few glitches here and there... LIKE NOT RELOADING PROPERLY! Sure you may encounter a HACKER TO RUIN LIFE. But overall, it's not pay to win, you can easily obtain what you want with just a bit of time and patience, whether it's mercs or opening AROUND 200 CASES AND GET **** ALL... sorry! I rate this game for it's objective based theme, whether you're good in gun fights or just overall terrible, there is always a merc that will suit your play style, medic, engineer, badass RHINO with a mini-gun or just simply keep ur team wealthy with ammo. :) Just remember, teamwork is key, communicate, strategize and execute together to overcome your enemy. (Teabagging is not recommended, as recalled on one of the most important rules of Dirty Bomb. Even though you're playing Dirty, don't... be... a... d.i.c.k :)
