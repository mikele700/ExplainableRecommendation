I feel like i bought a 1$ packet of chips WIHOUT CHIPS IN IT!Quite simply: I CANNOT PLAY IT! ... It's BROKEN! I haven't been able to connect to any servers and when I do, the game crashes!  Why do they even try to sell this game?! Do they seriously expect to make money this way?! Have they even tried the game before selling it?!
