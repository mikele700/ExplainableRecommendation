Absolutely one of the most difficult games I've ever played. So frustrating, but so addictive. Flashbacks to playing old platformers on my Commodore 64 back in the day, not just because of the graphic style, but because games used to punish you when you weren't good enough. Don't expect any hand holding here!!
