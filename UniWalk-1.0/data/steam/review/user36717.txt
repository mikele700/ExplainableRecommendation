Holy Crap.Prepare for a long rant.7 Days to Die, what the hell, Fun Pimps?I bought this game maybe 2/3 years ago because some youtuber played it and I thought it looked fun, and guess what, it was pretty fun!Then they released some update that ruined it's compability for me, and i uninstalled it, and forgot about it for a few years.Now I looked in my 'Bad Games' category on my steam library and saw it again, and I remembered that it existed, i looked at the store page and found Mostly Positive Reviews, which confused me.Regardless, i decided to give it a shot again, who knows, it might be good again.Here's what happened.-------------PRE GAMING---------------I launched the game, it took around 7 actual real life minutes of real time before the Main Menu screen loaded up, which is always a good sign, but I pressed on, doubt weighing on my mind.Fixed some settings, and was confused for around 3 minutes at the default Resolution it gave me. 1024 x 751.751 ??!?!?, what kind of a resolution is that man?Character Creator, it's amazing how many unnessecary options there are, like foot size sliders, and it's also just as amazing how every character looks the same, no matter how you customize the face.I finally decided to start a game, which scared me as it took around 4 minutes to load the main menu, how long would it take to generate a world?I noticed it finally has randomly generated worlds now, so that's good, i guess.It took around 2 minutes to load the game, and when i was thrown into the game I realised it was slower than a drunk snail and i had to lower even more settings.Now you may think, 'it's just your computer bro', and on any other game i'd agree with you, but My crappy computer can run Skyrim with 200+ mods, Fallout New Vegas with 200+ mods, and Saints Row 2 just fine, so i'd expect a small little survival game in alpha would be able to run smoothly at medium.Nope, dead wrong there, and even on the lowest possible settings, it still froze for about a minute every few minutes or so.Finally, after i changed the settings and waited around 5 minutes for them to take place, I could finally start the gaming.-------------GAMING---------------I was met with a quest to make a stone axe, and after searching around for plant fibers which I could not find for the life of me, i collected everything else i needed, i noticed while running away from a bear i had collected the fibers somehow even though i hadn't actually found any? I dont know.I finally decided to make the axe, and with a relatively fast moving zombie on my tail and around 70 health left, i quickly spammed the keyboard, looking for the magical inventory button, which the game comveniently never told me what it was, i had to look in the controls menu before i found out it was defaulted to 'Tab', of course.I finally made my axe, 'Now i can kill those rotting, jerkily moving zombies!' i thought to myself, and i started to swing at the zombie who followed me, and after about 10 swings he finally hit the floor.Then, a nurse zombie hit me 3 times and i died, and while the screen went black, i could hear nothing but the very loud screeches of zombies as the game tried to load me into a new area.Luckily, I had set it so i would keep my toolbar upon death, so i didn't lose my half broken axe when i spawned into a desert, however, the game had decided that I was a complete f***ing idiot for dying (you idiot), and had reduced my max health and stamina to 89 points, which i found absolutely ridiculous, way to punish confused players struggling with lag.So anyway, I set out into the desert, and stumbled upon a lone zombie, who i tried to kill.Again, after 12 or so swings he finally fell to the ground, and there was me, bleeding out on 27hp after maybe 2 hits from him.I encountered another zombie by itself and tried to kill it, and died in one hit.Spawned in again, and the game must really think i'm incompetent because it graciously provided me with 79hp this time instead. After exploring a bit I found an abandoned town, and tried to set up camp in a house, the door was broken, so I destroyed it and tried to build a new one, but the game obviously thought i was doing it too correctly, and rotated it so it faced towards the doorframe, and not towards the outside or inside.By that point I had had enough, and I quit.-------------FINAL THOUGHTS---------------Good job, Fun Pimps, you really know how to drop the ball.This game costs around $30, and the awful thing is, it used to cost more.I bought it, and the very day after, they had reduced the price permantely, so that's fun, but I enjoyed it, and i had fun.But then they did something and it made the game awful, like genuinely awful.This game is ugly, badly put together, it is almost unplayable on lowest settings for me, and I can play skyrim with over 200 mods and still have that run smoothly, the game is unfair on the default, normal difficulty and the zombies are jerky, not in a 'this is supposed to look like this' way, they're just badly animated and jerky, you die too quickly and the game takes away from your base health if you die.If I can do anything with this review, it will be to dissuade someone from getting this thing.It's honestly less of a game and more of a money laundering scheme, i mean come on, 2+ years and still in alpha?I'm probably not going to be able to get a refund on this but i'm sure as hell going to try, and if I can stop at least one person from getting this game and making the same mistakes as I did, I will be happy.1/10 - It used to be ok.Good luck and Happy Gaming.-Zanoscar
