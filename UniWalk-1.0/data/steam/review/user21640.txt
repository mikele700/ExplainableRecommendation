This game has had one of the freshest concepts in recent years, followed by the worst DLC practices. The developers said sorry and fixed their game. Now enjoy it. If you paid for it a year ago you get to keep everything you bought plus more. As a f2p you earn your characters by playing the game. I enjoy it, and have a ton of fun playing with friends.
