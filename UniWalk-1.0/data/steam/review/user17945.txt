It's a really fantastic game. I've got 400+ games on it. Haven't tested out the ranked queue yet but you get some idiots in the other queues who end up wasting time before rage quitting. There's also quite a few cheaters still which isn't great and way too many quitters. I've had 7 people die on night one because 5 of them quit on day 1. At the end of the day though it's a brilliant game over and I would reccomend it to others!
