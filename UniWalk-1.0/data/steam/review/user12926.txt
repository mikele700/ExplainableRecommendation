Kills someone with magical headshotGets reported10/10 will do magical headshots again
After playing for a while, the games gets really boring. Howevever, there is potential in this game. The matchmmaking works fine. The game loads pretty fast. The level design does not really look good and there is quite a few glitches. The lack of maps makes the game boring really fast
This is a really fun FPS stratergy game which is very heavily relied on teamwork. You and 3 other players control a ship and must always communicate constanly to stay alive. Its has a good in-game community and getting into servers is quite fast.Its very easy to understand the game and get used to it. The graphics looks quite amazing too. If you are planning to get this during a sale, go and get it.Its really worth it.
First of, the graphics may look great but really the gameplay just spoils everything. They throw you in the game with no toturials and expect you to be a expert on hunting. The game is 90% walking,5% rethinking about your desicion downloading this hell of a game and the other 5% hunting. This game should just be called walking in the wild everywhere simulator.
