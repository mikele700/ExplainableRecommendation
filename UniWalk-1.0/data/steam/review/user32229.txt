Dota 2 is a real competetive game that is extremely entertaining with friends. Dota 2 is by far the most competetive game in the world and will most likely live to be one. I would prefer playing this game with friends to communicate with easily (e.g: mic) while playing. I prefer Dota 2 over LoL because:Dota 2 is a much more competetive game because you do not need to buy the heroes. In LoL you would need specific heroes to counter other heroes and it may be locked.LoL is designed to be more of a social MOBA and make players get addicted to the game. This is why they have made the Locked Characters.LoL is just ♥♥♥♥ okay.
