Killed a guy, wearing a horse helmet 10/10
After playing for 100+ hours and getting all the achievements, i must say this is probably the best dark souls so far, how ever it does feel easier than Dark souls 1 but unlike Dark Souls 2 it offers more than enough challenge to be a great play even through NG+++, i'm about to go into NG++++ with hype to clear NG+7 or maybe more.TL;DR = I would recommend it to all! With DLC around teh corner i can't wait!!
