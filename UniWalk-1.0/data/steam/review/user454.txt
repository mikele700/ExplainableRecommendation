Fantastic game. Well worth the price of admission, though maybe that's my nostalgia talking.
About 15hrs in and really enjoying it. Party creation was a bit daunting at first, not wanting to miss any core skills etc. but overall is handled well. Solid game, throwback to fallout two, and executed well. Only time wil tell from here, fingers crossed the story arc keeps swinging.
