RNG/10.
Have you ever read a good book and got so emersed in the beautiful story, diverses characters and climactic drama that you begin to have a real conection between you and the characters? well i can honestly say that this game is a peice of art in that sense, over time playing the game, the set to be run away girl 'Elisabeth' draws such raw emotion out of you that until the very end of the game you'll feel responsible for her protetion...never felt so bad about killing 'people' in a game before.9.5/10
