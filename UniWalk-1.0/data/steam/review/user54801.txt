Probably the best ♥♥♥♥ing game that has ever been conceived. It is defiantly a difficult game that requires intense skill and intellect. Not a game for the faint of heart (or children) It is extremely addictive but satisfying at the same time. So much better than Call of Duty and Halo and all those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console games and thats not even a subjective statement, its fact.
