I-'ve played this game since it was in alpha. Back in my day there were tons of people playing this game. Everyone loved playing it when they-'d get home from a busy day. But then when 1.0 released and Jagex bought it...-Oh No- -JontronEVERYTHING THAT I KNEW AND LOVED WAS GONE.(The only servers that anyone still plays is Zombies. WHY???? I don-'t know. All I can say is BLAME JAGEX!).
Okay, even though I have put it off for a while, Robocraft has gotten me hooked again. Yes AGAIN. But now that some major updates have came out I'm getting back into it. The visuals are really good now and many old bugs such as clipping through respawn area's are gone. Then again, more bugs will be found, and fixed. Mostly by the community. So yeah. I'd recomend Robocraft to anyone. 10/10
This game is one of the best survival games ever. From the gameplay to the community, this indie title reaks of nostalgia. Gameplay-wise, it's simple. But you can so deep into this game that you can't get out of the cycle of finding a Timberwolf* or a Maplestrike*. In my opinion this game is two things, DayZ and Minecraft.94%*Timberwolf is the rarest sniper rife in the game.*Maplestrike is a military grade assault rifle.
Ah ROTMG. You died as you lived. Microtransactions.YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Installs game, gets the sticky grenade launcher, blows self-up, GETS EARRAPE.Still fun though but honestly, I don't know about this one... Get it for your body. Not your ears. :--
Hey. It's CS:GO. You don't need a reason to buy it. Just buy it.

Codename CURE. Think about a threeway between TF2, Counter Strike and Left 4 Dead. Thats what the game is.Also on harder difficulties, its just spray and pray.
