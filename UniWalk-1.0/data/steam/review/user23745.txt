I find this game the most underated game of all time. Yes its amazing and i love it. But you have to be great at the game to be able to play it
how many times do i remeber being on the same startup screen
um i love this game
the only fps that can beat this game is goldeneye007. tons of hours of gameplay.its a force o nature
