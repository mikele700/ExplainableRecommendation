Nearly all the reviews i see are about optimisation.... just wait for an update that will fix it. The game its self is an incredible and immersive experiance. Highly reccomended :)
FULL HD AND MORE FPS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10/10, if you dont like it you probably dont have it or you're a hater :/ worth....every......DOLLAR
fun, but crashes online all the time and didnt transfer my stuff over from xbox :(  6.5/10
the games good and all but the commuity is RUBBISH, you have to use certain guns or you a complete tosser, they should just keep 3 guns in the game because no one likes you if you use the others (and no sprinting) 7/10
