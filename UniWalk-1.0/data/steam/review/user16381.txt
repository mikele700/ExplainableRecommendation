Thought demo was the full game.0 / -10
One of the best sci-fi games out there.
Bought on Hanukkah praised be Yahweh.Never played because it was released in 66 A.D.10/10 would anti-play again.
Bought the game because Cr1TiKaL said it was good.Actually not that bad.8/10p.s. It is actually not that bad.
More like Sword of the ♥♥♥♥ II: Wishes It Never Happened Edition0/10- Quality of game on release- Byzantinely complex ingame wiki with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ links going nowhere and places they shouldn't- Game is barely playable and a chore to actually play- Lack of meaningful progress with updates
After hearing that menu music which I hadn't heard in so long.[RoN intensifies]
Resembled the fall of the western roman empire when it came out.the ♥♥♥♥, Jon.However later on it became so reverse ♥♥♥♥ it is now amazing due to G&K and BNW.Don't buy this without buying the expansions, or else you'll be in for a surprise. (not the good kind)
Would rather play Willem Dafoe Basketball
