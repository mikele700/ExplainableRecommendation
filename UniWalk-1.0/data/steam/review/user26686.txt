I gotta say, the game was great. We can all tell that they put alot of effort into the game and it was worth it. The campaign was excellent and the outfits are hilarious. But in some bits of the game there was some bugs. Other than that, its an awesome game.
team fortress 2 has good weapons in the inventory which you can find in battle.
