Hover has been very good so far, the parkour is as smooth as it can be at the moment and I, for one, find it pleasant to find a first person game that doesent have violence, yes I like TF2 and CS (CS:GO) and Half Life, but it's nice to get away from all the violent games every now and then.for early access, it's doing better than I expected in terms of the environment and what is going on and the all around feel of it.Though every game has flaws and this is no exeption the frame rate is rather poor but I was expecting that and YOU SHOULD TOO thankfuly the devs are working hard to fix that, the other problem I have is the repetitive music. It's just the same song over and over again, and I uderstand that people may realy enjoy the music.Once the optimization has been compleated I would like to see a music playlist for the game so it will have more of a variaty of background music, and if it were to allow you to add-in your music from your computer, that would be a neat feature, but I don't have my hopes up for that.to end this review I would like to give this game a 8.9/10 keep up the good work guys!! once it has fully realeased I will review it again and hopefully with a better score.
