i think this is a great game especially for the fans of the how to train your dragon franchise. i've clocked 60 hours and there is still plenty more to do, the racing is really fun besides the odd cheater that cuts the track but still is good fun, the alchemy lan is good for learning science and there are tons of dragons to grow, train and use. the game tends to favor the people that can use money in it becasue most things cost quite i few gems but even so it is still great. i recommend this to really anyone and if you do get it i hope you have a great, fun, dragon training time.
im currently tier 9 on this game and have clocked u 190 hours. i think it is a brilliant game and its only int beta so it has lots more great stuff to come. the maps are well made, it has multiple websites to help with everything, it has platooning but unless you have premuim you can only have 3 people in you platoon which isn't to bas because normal matchs consist of 12v12 or 10v10 sometimes even 15v15 then the challenge matches consist of 3-4 high tiers vs 12 low tiers and then you have mega boss battle which is one tx-1 tier vs a ful tram of whichever tier. this game has hundreds if not thousands of different builds for smg's, plasma cannons and rail guns(sniper), there is a good perk tree that allows you choose paths into helicoper rotors to plane wings and rudders then onto walker legs and tank tracks, hovers or even just rocket boosters and then of course basic wheels. there are gun branches, stronger block branches, melee branches and lots more. so i thinks its a great game for anyone, it prevokes the imagination to come inside everyone, so i reccomend it to all.
