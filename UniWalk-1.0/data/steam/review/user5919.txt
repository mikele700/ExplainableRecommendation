Dis game is best, must buy for much fun forever #HappyDays
Rust, Is a survival game. Which i think has horror in it :P (I yell when a zombie behind me hits me)When you first spawn in you would see so many trees and rocks then finding at town and going into it, And realising theres radation. Meeting a new player is actually scary, Hes naked and might have a hatchet or rock and hes running at you.People are very harsh in this game, Especially the Chinese people me and my friend found. They are horrible they-'re not nice at all. We were walking past and they said something in Chinese then said -You are mudahfahker- and killed us. We did not do anything to them, Then we found their base and at that point another friend xKoriat joined and helped us. We gave the Chinese-'s a nickname from what they said -Chong-Dongers- this was a funny name. The server is (CN)24k and some random numbers.The amount of fun in this game is unbelievable if you don-'t have it now, you should get it. It is worth buying!19.99 USD is some money but as i said It is worth buyingMy friend Sgt. Red helped me out alot, Also buying me RustAnd xKoriat for playing with us!
