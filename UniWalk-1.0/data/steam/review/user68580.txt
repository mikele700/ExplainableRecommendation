Anyone who dosen't like this game is messed up.Such an hilarious game, the death messages are the best.It's worth how much it is right now, i definately get this game if you are a fan of 8-bit games or like funny games.
Fun little game to play.Very good multi-player and it's full of action.I've played around 10 hours on this game and i have had fun on it every minute.The part i enjoy is selecting the characters loadout and then getting straight into the game as it is exciting.I'd reccomend this to anyone who dosen't have a good enough pc to get a game like payday as it's fun no matter how good the graphics are.
Amazing fun game to play, dosen't lag at all and i have a small computer and i have it on the best graphics.I'd reccomed this game to anyone who likes evolution games.
Such an amazing game
Fun little game that i have spent over an hour of playing it.It's a super hard game but not being able to complete the levels makes you want to try again.The game is a fast paced super trippy puzzle game.And to be honest it's worth how much is it.
It's good for Â£0.44 but the game itself isen't spectacular.It's probobly the third best tower game i have played but tower games aren't really what i play.If you like tower games pick the game up and you'll have picked up a bargain, my friend has completed all of this without closing the window once so you can see how enjoyable it is.Yet again if you like tower games then you are picking up a bargain
