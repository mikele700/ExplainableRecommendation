Great Game.
This game is more rigged than a stacker machineI also got a robot drunk10/10
I wish this was real life
The game where I actually cared about rectangles and their feelings, (and figured out the fact that I had no friends, but that is ok, I made friends with other rectangles that are actually myself).11/10 would be alone again!
It's my life simulator, except I am a pig!10/10
The worst racing game I have ever played0/10
The game that I bought for full price but goes on sale a day later as well as beating it in 3 hours, not being able to refund it.10/10
Besides the fact it says I am on a loading screen that never connects best game ever!10/10
