I can practise setting people on fire and splitting their skulls open with barbed axes before I do it in real life.Thanks Valve :D
A bland and boring -game- made by an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ called Phil Fish (Look him up)It looks good, but good graphics isn-'t a substitute for bad gameplay.The puzzles and worlds are overly simple to solve/navigate and the only mechanic gets boring to use after an hour.Don-'t trust all the big review sites like IGN and don-'t spend money on this boring -experience-, buy a dvd on paint drying in slow motion(More interesting than FEZ will ever be) it-'s not worth buying this game for the full price or discounted in steam sales.
Best $15 I have ever spent, even though it took 2 years to spend it. Even in beta, its amazing how much gameplay there is.
