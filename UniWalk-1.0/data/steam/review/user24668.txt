By far the best Hitman game in the series. Unlike absolution it puts the player on an open map in which you can choose how and when you want to kill your target.
To sum up this game in a windows command Control-Alt-Delete End Task
All my life i wanted to be a goat now i can be one. 10/10 GOATY
Great sandbox game endless things to do. Will work great on slow computers cause it runs on the well optimised source engine.
