I would not reconmend this unfinished zombie survivalist. Crashes when the game is saving at times and the cutscenes (it is probably my files are corrupt even though they have been checked clear) are as  buggy as a cheap bug simulator. The gameplay is alright with some interesting but seemingly copied crafting mechanics.Difficulty spikes do occur every nw and then but most of teh game is too easy. Eg: Was casually walking through on a swamp island, found a place to rest  knowing once opened i would be swarmed but then every other place to rest had been easy to take so i opened it up, instantly wave after wave of armoured zonbies appeared leaving me 1v25, 'bring it on' i think, to my surprise because of clunky controls i died twice and teh third time i crashed, again... =/ would not recommend even if its a gift for soemone else.
