[/h1]The Year Of RemakesLast year was the year of sequels and/or reboots. Most were, indeed quite crap (i.e Tomb Raider, Max Payne 3, Roller Coaster Tycoon 4 and Hitman Absoulution) except for one... and that is.. my favourite game... [/strike]Call Of Duty Ghosts The Binding Of Isaac Rebirth. This game took the original. beat it up until it vomited all the good parts, beat up itself, vomited all of the good stuff up, froze the good stuff in gold and platinum and then made it win gold in the Olympics, only then was it decided that this would be a game, it is the original only much better. sincierly, my computer I broke out of rage whilst playing this game. 10/10
