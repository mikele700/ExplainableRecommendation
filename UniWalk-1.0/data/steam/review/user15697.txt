This game is a good one if you like The Forest but with Stranded Deep it is a water version
Great game fave of the free to play...Do i recommend this game?Ummmmm...let me think...hell yeah i recommend it
This is a good free-to-play game if you are looking for that single-player survival or multi-player with friends. I have enjoyed this game so much that if im not playing one of my paid games im playing this.
