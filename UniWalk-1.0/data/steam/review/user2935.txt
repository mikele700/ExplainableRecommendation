They killed it. They killed Heroes of Might and Magic.♥♥♥♥ you Ubisoft.♥♥♥♥ you Limbic.
Notice how practically all the negative reviews genuinely like the game, but for some reason give it a negative review because they're all impatient, whining children who want party queuing?That's not a reason to give it a bloody negative review.Good game, my words can't give it justice.
IT'S F*CKING DOTA.
