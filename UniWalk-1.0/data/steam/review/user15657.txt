Game made me rage quit, cry, break things, rip my hair out and yell countlessly at the Pope and my computer screenBest game I have ever bought - 10/10
This game is really fun if you like 'strategy' easy games that don't take too much effort to play.If you really like playing games and you think you can do a good job at making them, give this game a go :)
