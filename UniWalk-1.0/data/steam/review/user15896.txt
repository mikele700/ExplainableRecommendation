Definately worth getting, amazing story that changes based upon your decisions and that carries into the next season? What isnt to love?The story itself is full of compassion, dedication, sacrifice, loss, good times and bad times.Characters are portrayed amazingly and act different according to how you act to them.In a game where an action and small as removing food from a car can drastically change the whole game, its replay value is incredible. Cant wait to get season two, definately worth the buy, so its the 400 Days DLC.
