The game is so disapointing. Perfect in every way BUT becomes completely stupid when players can just teleport into a plane (fighter or bomber) use it to kill you then apear back in their own tank completly unharmed. No flying skills are even needed, you can just crash the plane into a tank and disable it or destroy it. This feature is just stupid and is a game breaker. To have game after game of ground battles decided by who is first to gain air superiority is stupid. If you do play the game dont waste money on it, there will be plenty of times you are betten in completely stupid ways that bear no resembalance to a proper ground battle tactic and it will make you angry more often than you have fun games. If they ever remove this STUPID -feature-  I would definatly recomend the game but as it stands it rates very high on the stupid scale.
