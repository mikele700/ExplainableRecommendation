Really cool game if you are used to shooter games. It is very intense and realistic, you can get killed pretty quickly and vehicles can blow up easy. Also the maps are very beautiful and great to explore with lots of hiding spots. Arma 3 has a large range of weapons that can suit all playing styles so I highly recomend it for people who are reasonalbly experienced at shooter games.
This game is just awesome seriously, and its free! Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is the best free game on steam. Your probly thinkning it's free but I still have to buy DLC to enjoy the game but your wrong, You don't have to pay to have absolute fun with the game it's actually the exact opposite it's like they don't want you to pay. The weapons in the game are so inventive and unique eg. Jarate ( for sniper ) ♥♥♥♥ to throw at spies to uncover them. Really that is some crazy stuff xD . Everything is just perfect about this game, don't hesitate just get it.
