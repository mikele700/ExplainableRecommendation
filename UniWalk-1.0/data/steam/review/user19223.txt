In spite of Jordan, you phalice.
If you don't already have this I have no idea why, its maximum price when not on sale is $5 for a games that isn't what you thought it was. When I first saw my brother playing this I just thought 'why are you paying this button mashy game' it turns out I thought this aloud. He let me sit down and have a shot, and man I did not want to get up. I bouth this game and relised that survival is not open from the start (Im sure there is proper reasoning as to why), so I went straight into the levels/story. It is grea at telling you how to actually play and it doesn't try to force any kind of story on you at all. Then I unlocked survival and man was I in for a treat, I made a record for myself, broke it, broke it again, and kept on breaking it FOREVER! Just pick this game up, you will see what I mean!
What, What in the butt!
