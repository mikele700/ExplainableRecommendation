It's a great game, but its dead; the only ones who play are high ranked people, If you want to play you better have a group of +8 friends since that way you can make an Inhouse tournament or something, otherwise just buy it for the ♥♥♥♥ of buying GG games, since they're great.Great anime graphics though, Liked those.
