Amazing game and storyline, well worth the $$$You can't help but get emotionally attatched to the characters along the journey, they all have unique personalities that you can't help but love.. or hate. Being able to choose between options that will either make or break people makes this game feel real, like it's up to you what happens and not the character you play as. Definitely one of my favourites!Well done Telltale! 10/10
