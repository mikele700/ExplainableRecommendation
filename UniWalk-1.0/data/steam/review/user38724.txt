Trying to renew subscription, wtf is going on. wont let me. FIX THIS PREMIUM SERVICE OR ♥♥♥♥ THIS  OFF FROM STEAM. GET IT RIGHT OR DONT TRY AT ALL. Money is in my account but wont renew........FUCCCKK
Please add support for T500rs and TH8A shifter with force feedback cause i feel i just wasted $40 or more dollars for somthing that does not support 2 or more devices and no FFB. This is the bare minimum a game like this should offer. Cant wait to play but so far not happy since there were talks in fourms about this in 2014 and still no support. I would also like to use my Saitek X52 to operate the Lift arm to have a real experience, Please Fix This
