The Depth of this game is amazing there are so many things you can do including mastering recoil be that annoying person who votes for dust 2 all the time and more.I would rate this 8/8 m8 its gr8.But seriously the game involves skill and alot of effort if your not prepared to spend about 7 hours a week on this game you will probobly never get to global.
