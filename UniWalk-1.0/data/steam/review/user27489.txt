Solve people's problems by shooting at things inside them, battle against a giant potato man who asks philsophical questions and marry a seal or a duck.That's all you need in a game.
A little short for an RPG, but every second is absolutely amazing. You won't find a game of this genre that's this unique. Where else will you fight corgis in battle armour and play a dating simulator with a skelton?
This game is basically what woud've happened if SEGA hadn't lost their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minds. A really fun Sonic-esque throwback that's better than any recent actual Sonic game.
