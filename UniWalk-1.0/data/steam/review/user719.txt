Don't buy it. It doesn't work well on Windows 10, and it looks like it never will. Apparently the developers don't care about their costumers. They are not going to fix game breaking exploits nor handle trolls. I didn't have fun playing, just disappointment. My money was thrown at people who don't deserve. Hope it helps someone to not waste money, there are a lot of better games that need support.
This game is simply awesome in all aspects. 11/10. A must buy.
