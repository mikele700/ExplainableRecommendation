Red Crucible firestorm was a really fun game before the most recent update. It just isn't fun anymore. Before the update, the only problem was that the game is pay-to-win. You have no chance at winning unless you're in a tank or have a gun that costs around $20. But even then you'll have to deal with the countless hackers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who ram the ♥♥♥♥ out of you with a helicopter. Overall I just reckon if you want to be free-to -play AND win, this is a game to stay away from.
