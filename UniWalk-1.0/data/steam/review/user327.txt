10/10 ned flanders simulator 2013. enjoy all the murder and obscenety of ned flanders, before doing anything in this game, ask urself, would ned flanders do this? the answer is yes. the answer is always yes.
This is a great game, but it ends rather quickly, what would make this game better is additional content and quests, maybe even a workshop. because there are so many ways that this game could expand on it's self, but that's just my opinion. 6/10
