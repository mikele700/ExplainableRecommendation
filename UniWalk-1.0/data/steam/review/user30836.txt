Very enjoyable. Very similar to the games 'STAIRS' and 'OUTLAST'. Very atmospheric and creepy. Definitely worth a pick up if you love the horror genre and need a good scare!
One of the curator-'s -'reviews-' for this game stated, -'-A zombie game that-'s truly about survival. Nothing-'s as scary as getting ambushed by zombies while searching through an abandoned shack for food.- Boy, this couldn-'t be more of a lie. It needs to be changed to, -A zombie game that-'s truly about profit. Nothing-'s as scary as being bug hit by a half in the ground zombie who walked through the closed door, whilst you try to pick up a bugged out rotten kiwi.
