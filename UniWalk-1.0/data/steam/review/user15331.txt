This is my first review, and I only picked up the game this morning, about 2 hours ago. And in those 2 hours of gameplay, I can honestly say that this is a fantastic game, with a great learning curve, lots of tactics and intense battles. Trench Warfare itself in a game is refreshing, and from what the Devs have done so far, I think the game will just continue to get better, there are tiny inconveniences, as to be expected, but nothing that stops you from enjoying it.Some things like a supressions system from RS/RO would be great to see in Verdun, and maybe some more blood/gore, just to show how bad the trenches really got. Overall, excellent. 8/10Edit: not even 2 hours gameplay and I'm in love. Screams quality to me.
