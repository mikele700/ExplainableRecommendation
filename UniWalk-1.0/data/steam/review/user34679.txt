Got to name a Stegosaurus Stego10/10 would name again
Have been having a blast with this game, No frame drops, A couple of visual glitches but it hasnt been out that long so it can be excused. People that are having performance issues i dont know what drugs you are on or what kind of rig you are using but i think its time for an upgrade. This game doesnt need story or dramatic events, Its just blow ♥♥♥♥ up and smile while doing it. load a car in the back of a cargo plane and drive it out with boosters on the bottom. Thats the kind of ♥♥♥♥ that is sooo good about the game
