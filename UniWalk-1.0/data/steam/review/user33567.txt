Horrible game!The optimization is like it's running on a 32 BIT engine, Video quality is horrible and buggy. This game is just a flop and it was too hyped, I'd rather become a Console peasant then play this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.
Graphics are really realisticPhysics on pointI rate this game 21/10 IGN
Got vac banned
Fun RPG, Highly recommended if you are into mmo Rpg games, only flaw is the graphics but not to fussy about it, this game will probably be fun for a good 4-5 months 200 hours or so
21/10 IGN would bang again
