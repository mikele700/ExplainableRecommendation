Does not compare to Fallout 3 or New Vegas.Simple pro's and con's summary.Pros:Nice new and improved perk systemGraphicsWeapon attachmentsMods (still a shame that features that should have been in from the start are required as mods).Choices impact storyDecent plot-twistTinker TomCons:Miniscule amount of quests/missions for a bethesda gameMinimal effort put into building mechanics by game devs, could be great and add replayability if improved. Minutemen questline is uninteresting and repetitiveLegendary weapons from legendary enemies. Why would something that encourages farming be introduced to a Fallout game...Dialogue systemVATS is stupid, you can just hide in cover and only pop out when your AP recharges to kill enemies easily.End-game, powerful armour is almost exclusive to power armoursBugsVoiced protagonist, would be nice to have the option to remove or change. RPG's should allow the player to create their own character and the voice feels limiting.Annoying inventory and hard to use map (roads not easily visible).If I hadn't bought on a steam key site I would refund. Also to think people in Australia paid $110 for it.
Micro-transactions were recently implemented despite the developers promising that there wouldn't be any.
