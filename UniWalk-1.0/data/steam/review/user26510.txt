It was fun... Not anymore... Not unless you love a -fair Battle Rating- system which pairs up prop planes versus jet planes...But I keep coming back to it... Wierd...
*insert positive and funny review**insert joke about Gaben**insert rant about how good the game actually is**insert relevant hat joke**insert line -you should definately install and play this game now-*
Wow, Cities: Skylines... Where to begin...- Firstly, this game is the game that EA's Simcity should have been, except about 1000 times better. More buildings, more options, better gameplay mechanics and generally more everything!- Secondly, The gameplay and the customisation feature of this game are truely its strong point. With thousands of Workshop items, assets and vechicles created by a community of dedicated fans that are added to your game with a simple click. This adds a whole new level to a game which no other rival city builder can truely compare to. Did I mention that these Workshop add-ons are FREE???- Thirdly, The Developers ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE GAME. That is one thing that EA missed on with Simcity, EA just rode the current of their popularity river that the Sim series has created and as soon as the game was released, the game was mostly left to cough, splutter and die due to its lack of new features, AI problems and repetitiveness. Simcity did see a few updates but nothing compared to the love this game has recieved from the developers.This game has problems though, it has to be said. I have experienced problems during my play time, mainly around the stability on my PC, especially seeing as I am not running your typical /r/pcmasterrace beast machine. Asides from the occational lapse of framerate, crashes can occur. In the past, I have been left with a few hours of progress wiped because of foolishly not saving my progress. Collosial Order seem to have fixed this as crashes seem to happen less frequently then it used to but I do still see a occasional drop of FPS in my game, but again, I am not running an epic PC. Thinking of it, this game is so addicting that I have had to force myself to save or enable autosave.But that's really it, a lot of pros and a few tiny cons. Cities: Skylines is a must have for gamers who like Simulation games, City Builders, Moddable games and a whole lot of mircomanaging. I am yet to try out the new After Dark expansion pack that was released today (25/09/2015) but seemingly has added a whole lot of depth to this game that is already deep enough to compare to that of the Pacific Ocean.What are you waiting for? Buy the damn game already!EDIT (10/03/16): I highly recommend buying the game with the extra DLCs. Although it will set you back a bit more, you will be supporting future development of the game and the extra features are mostly worth it. Think of it as a virtual highfive to the devs.
Such a good game... Great storyline, good gameplay and relitively easy to use controls. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!
Look the features are good, regular updates and a great amount of content.Otherwise, grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind.

Great game although a bit dissapointed at the amount of In-game purchases to unlock more variety in gameplay. Still playable and fun even so.
Casual simulation game, for the occational relaxed gaming...
