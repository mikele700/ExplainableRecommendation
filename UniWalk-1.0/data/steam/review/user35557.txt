By the time I finished the first little boss I was ready to punch something and pull my hair out! This game can be frustrating but I can't stop. It's addictive, violent and if you're playing it in the same room as someone, they're going to tell you to stop yelling because it will make you rage...unless you're super pro or chill as ♥♥♥♥ but most of all, it's fun. I recommend it to anyone. It's a shame Hotline Miami 2 is banned here in Australia.
This is an awesome little game. I bought it on sale for 75c... the best 75 cents I have ever spent.
