its really brutal and hard to get started with but when you learn a character and how to deal with each enemy and boss you can be unbeatable and is so fun with friends off or online ive played around 6 hours more offline and even after all that my best is last level at 70 MINITUES which is just the equvelent of DEATH
its a cute little game and the only real story or purpose is to get as much gold as possible
Defy Gravity is a interesting concept and is a interesting pick up,For starters the music score for this game is brilliant and well placed for the levelsand the ownly downside to this game is the level length maybe some longer levels might have a diffewrent effect on how this game could have been seen i would still recommend this game for new or even avid platformer lovers and of all ages
This is a Wonderful Installment to the Civilisation Franchise i've played CIV IV and this to me is a big step up in graphics and depth of play and i Love the Expansitions Mostly the BNW because for the 98 i played the Civ Brave New World i felt the connection that i had to that game. I Would Happily Keep Buying games like these and even More from CIV
