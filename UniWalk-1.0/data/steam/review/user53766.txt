Great Game Highly recomend if you want to learn how to make suicide pills
I see so many negative reviews for this game, maybe a positive will help :)I'm about 40% the way through the campaign, no issues, no errors, no crashing (cough, cough) Positives - Riding a Sabre Tooth tiger or Cave Bear(Now that's bloody Awesome)- Being able to free roam (What game that doesn't allow that is good.)- Decent difficult levels, i love a bit of a challenge when it comes down to it. - Having really good upgrades on my character. - Taking down a massive enemy with a fatal blow- LOADS of missions to do Negatives - I did crash in the loading screen twice from when i started- The story is a bit weird- It gets REALLY annoying when you don't want to feed your Sabre, when really just want to ride it. Hopefully this game gets more appreciated for what it is getting
Game is very, un-stable, non-structured on how you have to walk ages to a store that only lasts 40 seconds? i don't even know anymore the developers are constantly updating this game, TRYING to make it better i just don't see it, :(
Perfect game for all
