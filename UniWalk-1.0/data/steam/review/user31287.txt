Really great game and brings in the nostalgia of the old arena shooters like quake, but the game did freeze on me when I tried to exit, but its still a great game,

beautiful but short

Got this game ages ago, but only had the chance to play it properly only recently, and my god is it amazing and addicting. One of the best Indie Games out.
Ditto.
