Guns of Icarus Is a good game a mix between Co-op and PvP. The game encourages you to bring friends along to play with you. The game lets you take on roles to keep your airship in battle.  What Makes Guns of Icarus so good in my opinion:- Theres 7 airships to choose from each with their own weaknesses and strengths- Theres a wide variety of guns to choose from from gattling guns to flare guns to mines- Not many people in Guns of Icarus are TOXIC in my opinion that I have seen. making it easier since the community is helpful and friendly. especially if you have voice chat they will be very happy to helpThere isnt a lot of bad things in this game and a lot of it isnt really much of a big deal. this game is not buggy so I really think its a good job.10/10
