10/10 I loved the previous games and this is those enahnced signigicantly. It is a masterpiece.
This is one of those rare games where the sequel actually lives up to the original. Both are magnificent, and if you liked the first game there is no reason you will not like this, in fact you would be seriously missing out.
Honestly I wouldn-'t consider Telltale-'s games -games-, they certainly are awesome stories made better by the interativity and choices they give you thuogh. The Wolf Among Us in my opinion is their best work. Amazing.
Really good game. I'm liking it alot and would gladly recommend.
