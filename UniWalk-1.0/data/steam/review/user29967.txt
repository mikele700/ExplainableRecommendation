There is no other reason for this game to exist except for -Because reasons...-.That phrase can be applied to anything in the game and I bet anything that the devs said the same thing at least 3 times during idea pitching.-Why do we need an incredibly over-powered gun that never runs out of ammo that you can get from the start?--Because reasons...--That-'s not a good reason.--Shhhh... Just ♥♥♥♥ kick an alien over a building whilsts dressed as a BDSM panda-
Awesome game for LANs. Showed it to my friends at my most recent one, everyone was really getting in it and enjoying themselves. Could use a bit of updating but a solid fun game.
