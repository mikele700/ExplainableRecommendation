Is good game but lacks some stuff....PROS:Good GraphicsGood StoryLots of CharactersRuns smooth You can punch the characters you don't like(For like example danzo who killed my shisui TT)Cons: You can't even change regions (It doesnt effect you but it would be nice to be able to change)Thats actually it I recommend itBye
