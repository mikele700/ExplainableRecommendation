This is a game where rushing in without a plan WILL get you killed (especially on higher diffculties if you want to go big).In PAYDAY 2 , planning the right strat . and co-operating with your teammates is key to getting you to your objective ,may it be sneaking out meth from a depot , or stealing weapons from a mafia's private hangar , all these require teamwork to pull off.There are primarily 2 playstyles and 4 skill tress for players to invest in .Loud or stealth. Perks in the skill tress can be unlocked through skill points that you earn through leveling up by completing multiple heists.Technician(Specialise in trip mines and saws,great to bring along for bank heists or maps that have atms) , mastermind (passive and active perks , highly recommnded for those who think they might mess up stealth or specailise in crowd control), ghost(the skill tree says it all , its like the sneaky-ish class of the game where its perks allow you to be fast and silent while being able to hack and take out your enemies one by one) and enforcer(heavy weapons guy,no further explaination needed here).Depending on what playstyle or class you prefer most(you can invest in multiple skill trees , blending different playstyles) , this is going to determine what role you play in the team of 4 players(fixed at 4 every heist) .There are a few key mechenics in the game , which i will point out in a moment .1.CamerasOn most maps , there will usually be cameras scattered around the map which will sound the alarm if they spot you or your associates.These cameras are monitored by a camera guard in a locked room(such doors can be opened through high-level ghosts , drills or keycards if you are lucky enough to find one.In most stealth missions , we heisters take killing the camera guard as the main priority so that we can progress more smoothly .You can shoot out a camera to get a guards attention(this causes them to patrol around the destroyed camera,but not be alerted).However , on higher diffuculties , cameras are protected by a bullet-proof barrier(these cameras are called TiTan cameras) , making it even harder for the heist to be completed.2.Guards Guards spawn throughout different maps and differ from level to level , and will alert other guards and sound the alarm if they spot you , so keep a lookout for these guys.Btw , they also drop a pager after being killed ,and you are required to answer the operator over the pager by pressing f , so dont mess up a nice heist by forgetting to answer them.Guards on different maps also have different health levels(also affected by difficulty levels).3.Stealth I cannot emphasise on this any more than i ever could .STEALTH is the main playstyle of the game(my personal opinion)In most missions , on higher levels , people tend to restart when they are spotted and if he alarm is raised because the resistance is very strong (polica forces have more health ,as well has high dps weapons).SO KEEP TO STEALTH.Finally , what about the communty?Well , occasionally , there WILL BE d***s , however , for the most part , everyones friendly because everyone wants to accomplish that ONE common objective(beware of grenade trolling dough , cause i do those as well ;)  )Trolls will be trolls , haters will be haters , but we will all be hesters , so yes , STOP READING THIS AND BUY THE GAME , AND PLAY IT NOW ,ALL PRAISE OVERKILLLLL
