1 of the best MMORPG's ever of all time the storyline and art work are 10/10 i'm so glad they bring this back to steam and its truily a free 2 play game u can pay for cool stuff but pay to plays can't get anyting better than what f2ps get its a master piece and its worth the time and gb i've got so mony hours on this off steam :)
only sh*t Sega did something useful for once after they destroyed my fav game DOW by buyibf out Broke THQ and canceling DOW 3 even know it was more than half way done
there's only one way to say this best DOW/game ever
