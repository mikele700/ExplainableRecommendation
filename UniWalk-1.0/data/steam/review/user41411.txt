Bought this game a couple of years ago now.Steadily played through every update enjoying every new feature implemented and every bug eradicated.Really great developers who have provided a supremely quality product. Ludeon set the benchmark for what a game should be.Congrats on your addition to Steam, this is one of the few indie games on the market here that truly deserve to be here.10/10
Great game for excercising your brain and micromanaging skills. However the AI leaves a little to be desired with their extremely one-sided trade offers and tendancy to denounce you whenever you lift a finger against another civ, including civs that they are also currently fighting or even to defend your own empire.
