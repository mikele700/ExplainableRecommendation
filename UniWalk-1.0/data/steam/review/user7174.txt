prior to play time i was expecting this to be scarier but in my 1.2 hours playing i was pretty disapointed there isnt anything scary about this game in the slightest ;p its 13 bucks down the hole -.- oh well, the unreal engine 4 this game runs on is pretty bad overall id rate this game a 2.5/5 it needs work there is potential
