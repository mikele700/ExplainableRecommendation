Ah yes, isn-'t it fun to play a bit of games and get totally freaked out when you-'re about to die. Well, this is the game for you. It pictures 14 different classes (for now) and each one has a different abilities and statistics. You can play as the super sneaky rogue or the super tanky knight. You get to decide which role you play. There are many different enemies and you must know when to take risks or not. Pros:-Exciting- 8-bit formatDifferent roles to playEasier gameplay in the middle of the realm for beginnerA lot of realmsCons:Some in-app purchases are totally not worth itThe fact that you have to start a new character when you dieSometimes a bit laggy and can affect gameplay
