This game is seriously charming. I've missed these 3d puzzle platformers, and while it isn't as lengthy or witty as Banjo Kazooie, The Last Tinker has definitely felt fun and familiar. The colours are gorgeous and the story is really quite sweet! Exploring the dichotomies of strength/anger, curiosity/fear through these little spirit elemental guys as you adventure through Colortown was super enjoyable, and I'd totally recommend it if you're after something fun and easy to play through.
