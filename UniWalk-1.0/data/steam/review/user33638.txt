Barely ran on my computer, many other games run fine but Rust didn't want to co-operate. Wouldn't suggest it to anyone without a high-end computer.
One of the best CoD games to date!
Excellent game, wouldn't buy it for $15 though, grab it while it's on sale!
It's a great game don't get me wrong but it just crashes constantly. The fact you have to download mods just to keep the game stable might put people off.10/10 ign great game other than the crashing but there's mods out there to make it more stable. (I recommend Script Extender and a save game mod, one of these seemed to help stop mine from crashing.)
Bought a bunch of cases and keys for $120, got a rusty knife. Might have contracted tetanus.10/10
I reccomend it for people who like killing zombies and RPGs. The side quests make the game go further but you don't have to do the side quests. Takes a while to complete but an excellent game!
Great game for people who  like tactical type of games.
