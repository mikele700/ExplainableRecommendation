Immediately one of my favorite games of all time. Think of it like a Telltale game but you as the player are much more involved in both the action and pace of the game, with much more player controlled gameplay, a mind-blowingly amazing soundtrack, suprisingly realistic and deep written characters, and a great asthetic and art style that gives a great nostalgic feeling. The games does great in making you understand the story of world around you, not just the immediate story, giving a rich sense of immersion. If you like games that tell a story and you don't buy this, you're missing out!
I hate this game I spend $200
