I actually played 90% of this game with my friend and together we kicked evil people-'s butts, drove cars around at top speed, blew up random people to see how high they got, rammed those same people with a jet and enjoyed bumping into cops and getting chase after while -stealthily- shooting RPG directed towards those who apposed us. Yeah it was fun. 10/10 randomness. In one of the DLCs you can unlock a massive ball of yarn to drive down the street and cause mayhem.
Good Game. Much buy.
One of my most played game purely because there is so much player made content that can be done such as surf, minigames and other assortments. There's always that little bit there that you want to strive to do better at.
Ever wanted to waste more time in one game than in real life.
I really like the way the game plays and the strategy involved with you friends. Really good co-op game.
If you have played any other Counter-Strike game welcome to CS:GO basically a re-skin of CS:S with some both minor and major changes. Such as the easy ability to do competitive match-ups, deathmatch and more. The ability to re-skin guns for money and open up cases with a skin chances of earning money. GLHF
