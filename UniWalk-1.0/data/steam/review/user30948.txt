Built a great base had weapons and armor, a mass of 20 naked people with rocks swarmed my house amd beat my door down. I kill most of them but I died, when I respawned I found the group of naked people and they welcomed me. 8/8 gr8 m8 would die again
I feel stained for ever thinking this game could have potential.
I played this game a long time ago when it was good. Now it's not good. Nuff said, uninstall.
IS BROKEN. Looked so good, friends played it and said it was good, then I get one glitch that can't be fixed even after I reinstalled and mow im sad. 10/10 ign would get broken again...
The anime girls have great detail!
Pros-Amazing level design, great graphics, good range of enemies...Cons-But, so many times will attack animations not match up with when they actually hit. You will have a hard time (50% of the time) invading a players world that isn't laggy as hell, many tiny little bugs that are too numerous to list (activley being fixed). You will breeze through a small portion of an area and think that you're doing great when somthing stupid happens (enemy hit you through a wall or a swarm of axe-wielding zombies attacks yoo) and you die... Again and again and again... And again. Neutral-You will die.Conclusion-Not worth the $80 (Australian) I payed, wait for a sale. But a fun game that I will be playing for a while. Don't get this game if you are close to sucide, It WILL push you over the edge.
Be a big dude and get all dem body mods for dem chicks. Look butt don't touch. 9/10 would mod again.
Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is perhaps one of the best games i've ever played, it has great graphics and stuff like that... blah bla blah, stuff about frame rate and weird glitch thingy. 9.5/10 gg
