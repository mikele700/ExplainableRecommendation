This game was inspiring to buy at first (5 months ago). Now I think this game was not what it said out to be like, examples space battles and no as much as mining*This game is about mining**don't buy this game*#NoMansLie
Rebel galaxy was such a good game (I thought). I recomend it to anyone who likes great soundtracks, adventure and space sim
this is a very good graphical game with good gameplay i like the game mechanics. i recomend it for people who like world war 2 games
This is a very funny game it's one of the best games that valve made. :D
