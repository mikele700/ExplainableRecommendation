no, don-'t play it, it only crashes, i have to put it on recommended for me to alert you,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME,it should NOT be clled -THE FOREST-, it should be called -THE GLITCH- or a more realistic name: 'THE CRASH-,not the plane crash,the crash that hapens BEFORE, DURING and second AFTER that, so don-'t waste your money on -the forest-, play unturned, it-'s blocky, but it-'s for free, or for 5 bucks if you want premium,but it-'s worth it, EVEN THE ♥♥♥♥ING 16 YEARS OLD DEVELOPER OF UNTURNED MADE A GAME ALL ALONE, BETTER THAN THE ♥♥♥♥ING FOREST
This game was more mercifull than the original, in my third run as isaac i killed mom, unlocked azazel and lazarus, half an hour later i was playing as azazel, accidentaly unlocked Eve, then Samson, got to mom under 20 minutes and nailed the boss rush(pun intended, i unlocked the nail), then i defeated mom's heart, wich i have to say was harder than the original's, but i still killed it, then unlocked eden, so basically under two hours i not only beated mom's heart and the boss rush, i also unlocked 5 characthers and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of items, i either got good or this game is frisk and the original is chara (Note: i'm praying that i got gud and for afterb irth not to kick me into redemption like the original did every two runs)10/10 would cry people to death again
Perhaps the best game of the franchise, hard, unforgiving and with a stealth mission so good that payday 2 will never make up to, this game may not be as customizable as payday 2, but it is worth it
