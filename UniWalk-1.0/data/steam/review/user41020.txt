Solid game much funOne of the best Military Shooters in the last couple of years. Althought, it has a steep learning it is a extremely relalistic and immersive.
Very intresting game. Deafinitely not for everyone, a couple of my friends bought the game tried it once and didn-'t enjoy the different action pace. This game will be very slow and mellow for 60% of the time then in the matter of moments you will be faced with many descisions that might lead life or death.-the real draw of DayZ is a combination of the risk of losing everything, or potentially coming out on top and winning everything- - Brian Hicks, DayZ Producer.
