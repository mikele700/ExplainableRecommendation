This is a fun and great way to get over your fear of the ocean or Sharks. (or just make it worse) To get over your fear of sharks just play as one and see how many divers you can gobble up.I found this game extremely fun and it was quite ammusing to eat all of those divers and seals or just to shoot all those sharks with your... machine gun? Do ask me how the assualt riffle works under water... that my friend is an unsolved mystery.I loved how when a shark is near you can hear your charecters heart beat getting faster and faster.Oh and those sea mines are my new best friends they are so helpfull...     ...KABOOM!!!! exept that they can also kill you... ... so I sugest you be careful with those.But over all I think that its a great game and I reccomend it to everyone!
