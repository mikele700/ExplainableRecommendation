Seeing such a great world full of potential in this game. Everything about the game play is great so far. U get to craft, u get to build stuff, and u get to raid and such. But currently this game is ruined by hackers and bad community management. Dun get me wrong, i'm in singapore and almost all the server i've played in has hacker, all the asia server has hacker. all the western server too lag to play. Official server, the name shd make ppl scared to use hack or ♥♥♥♥, but no. there are tons of hackers, ruining the game, u go out, gather resource and get some good gear and suddenly out of nowhere a guy with speed hack flash right infront of u, jerking left,right up and down, and seemingly just smack u to death with a rock, and not once but 4 times. so i said fine, i'll go to other part of the world, bam, aimbots and wall hack shooting from inside a rad town wall. Go to community server? no, admins hacking, admins not bothering about hackers cause they are friend and ♥♥♥♥♥. so unless garry and his team solve this problem, this game is a no go for asian gamers. (Pro Tip: just ban china, they are the major cause for hacking)
