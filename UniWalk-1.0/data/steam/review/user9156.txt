I thought there would never be a better space sim then the freespace 2: Blue planet mod, House of the dying sun proved me wrong. I knew it the moment I realized I needed to fly  inside  the shield array of a frieghter I had to destroy to stop it's escort ships from taking me out.Tight controls, good enemy veritey, fine missions that can be dealt with in different ways (can feel almost like a puzzle game), and the sound design is awesome.It's a gargantuan piece of work for one man and worth the price of admission if you like your space shooters.
