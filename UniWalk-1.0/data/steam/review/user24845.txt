I watched the animated series so it made the game even more enjoyable. This game is great fun with friends but you can also have a pretty good time alone cause you'll more than likely run into other lovers of the series which mean you can chat about your favourite moments or favourite episodes with them. Anyway highly reccomend this game is just so much fun and some of the quotes made are funny.
