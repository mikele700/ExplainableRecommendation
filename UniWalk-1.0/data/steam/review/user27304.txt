A good game with simple mechanics to appeal to those not fully into the RTS genre or for those looking for a more casual experience. I do hope that further updates for the game are released in the not too distance future though, as the game is a little barebones at the moment.
A nice little RTS that is essentially a stand alone expansion  to 8 Bit Armies. With a total of 4 factions to chose from now (assuming you also have 8 Bit Armies) the 8-bit experience is definately much deeper  than before with larger selections of units and strategies. Military vs Fantasy is also pretty cool. I do believe however, the game is a little unbalanced (eg mass air ), but that is to be expected as the game has just come out. There are also a few typos here and there (eg the tech trees). It would also be pretty cool if we could still have the 8-Bit Armies music in the game when the original factions are selected. If 8-Bit Armies' support was anything to go by, I'm sure Petroglyph will give 8-Bit Hordes the same treatment with constant tweaks and updates.Definately reccomended for fans of RTS or anyone who is looking for a more laid back experience.
