Good Game and will continue to clock hours on it since it is one of Paradoxes great successes
How to be cs:go pro1. Buy c-s2. Launch it up and leave it on for 2 weeks straight3. get over 100 hours of c-s and then brag about it on your next cs:go comp game how you played with the best pros back in the day10/10 still best game and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s better than cs:go
Good game, Lacks a fair amount of content in terms of what you can build/do unlike other city buildersWould reccomend to those wanting a city builder based around politics/history instead of money
Better than V1 and 2 combined
At first I thought this would be the greatest WWII strategy game of all time. After playing the online for about an hour I find the game needs a few improvements (EG; Not having only the one team to have OP weapons/tanks and the other having ♥♥♥♥ all). Overall the game I rate is about a solid 7/10 due to the fact that they have just made the game harder and less items to have unlike COH 1.
The only game with 1 aus server, Neither the less still a good game even with 200 ping 8/10
I came here because cs:go became full of hackers, please don't let this be the same. ANZAC#110/10
