10/10But pvp is very crowded and needs a bigger map but everything else is great.DO NOT compare this to DAYZ, DAYZ is a simulator not a casual game although they are alike they both have their own catagory and need to treated as two very different games
intense, worth the 10 mins and plus scared the crap out of my mates
