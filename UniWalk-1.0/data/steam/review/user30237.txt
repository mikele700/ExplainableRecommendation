Did I just finish playing the free demo? Then did I shell out $24 bucks to play the demo again? And am I now sitting here actually going -Holy crap this game is so good I-'m actually gonna leave a review of it-?Cause I am.I-'m not sure if it-'s the nostalgia or if it-'s the art style, but this game feels a lot like Megaman, and man did I love games that play like this.But honestly this game is a genuinely fun game that I can play, and I can play it with a laid back feel, listen to the great music and enjoy the game. Do reccomend.
