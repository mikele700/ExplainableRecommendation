Nice, needs to have some more stuff happen and cut scenes though.
You could save jack. You should pick Provoke when you trying save your buddy and only the provoking guy is beating. Begging works when you almost dead and you bleed. Then you may get some health. -THINK- makes your lies better. And confess is a confess. When you sold out every informations... well you-'re ♥♥♥♥ed. When you asking Liam for something, he going to look for it and give it to you next night.-ufeff
Best animation quality I have ever seen in a video game (relative to it's engine.).
Love this game, puzzles are super unique and great.
The character's animation and model look super amatuer. But the combat is good.
