there are so many ways to play, so many ways to enjoy. endless hours of hilarity in prop hunt, some creeps in MORBUS and spooks in Stop It Slender. get your survivor on with stranded, and kill all of your friends without eny particular reason in Trouble in Terrorist Town. or, you could mess with physics in sandbox. i have gotten so much value out of this, and i think that it's seriously underrated. sure, twenty dollars is a bit pricey, but its worth it for the blood, sweat, and hilarity of this mod.
OH GOD THE RAAAAAAAGEbut otherwise a very ingenious, puzzling, and overall highly BADASS game. 4/5.would've been higher if not for all that RAAAAAAAGE. you can be a ninja, a sumo champion, there are so many ways you can play this game, and all of them are amazing. my fave thing to do, pick an enemy up, then catapult him into the air, where he collides with his buddy, killing them both. PURE. AWESOME.
oh my god, how can i NOT reccomend this? this game is amazing.its unique, its fun, and i cannot find many things wrong with it. this game has given me more good times than all of my other games. BUY IT ITS AMAZING
