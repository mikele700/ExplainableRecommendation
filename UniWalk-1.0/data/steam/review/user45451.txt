Best damn F2P game in the world. Most games will give paying players some kind of advantage, but not this one. All paid objects will merely be cosmetic or availible to other players through the free drop system. The requirements are easy enough, as my own laptop can run this well. The fan work here is truely staggering. They are making weapons, levels, hats... but mostly hats. Always with the damn hats. The game comes with offline training modes against bots of varying skill, play those before going anywhere near the online segment. If you're the kind of guy who likes to sit at a screen waiting for the next mineral shipment in EVE, the trading community will fit right in, with an ever fluctuating stock market based on, you guessed it, hats! A bit of warning though: the fanbase has a mortal hatred for people who haven't paid yet. Get around this buy buying a huntsman or similar for about fifty cents, less if there's a sale on. Also, never wear the Ghastly Gibus. It's easy to get, but don't be fooled. It is commonly accepted as the sign of the dreaded F2Per. It also makes you head a target. There are lots of weapons and headgear availible, ranging into the hundreds or even thousands. No weapon has an advantage over the other. You may be attracted to the one with higher damage, but there will always be a downside to them. Come on in, new players! We'll find a spot for you lot.
