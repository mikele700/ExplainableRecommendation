11/10 Best game ever over 1000 hours on my 360
Great game, very fun and entertaining but has no workshop support which is really bad because there is alot of great mods for this game but i will still recomend it because its spactacular even without the mods. The thing that pisses me off about this game is that it doesn't have workshop support even tho it has alot of great mods. Iron lad or whoever does that ♥♥♥♥ PLEASE add workshop support it would make this game so much better
