This game is amazing.It has smooth gameplay and the graphics are good.
Here in my garage, just bought this new Lamborghini here, fun to drive up these hollywood hills,but you know what i like more than materialistic things.....KNOWLEDGE
If you're getting this game for the story, you should. If you're getting it for the gameplay, don't. The story of wolfenstein is decent. Because who doesn't want to kill nazis? But the gameplay gets really repetetive as there isn't alot of variety in the weapons and even if you find something else other than the gun you start out with, it wouldn't be very different. My advice would be to wait until this game is on sale for less than $10 to buy it. 6/10
If you love far cry 3, you will love this game. If you haven't played far cry 3 you will love this game. If you love this game, I love you. 4/4
Beautiful scenery, fun mechanics and amazing storyline. 10/10 Best $2.60 I've spent
Best 10 minutes I have ever spent 10/10 would waste my life again
Its warfare with bows, arrows, and SWORDS whats not to love?
A total mind F of an ending. The story is so good you might as stop reading my review and buy it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!why are you still reading this? I told you to buy it already! :D
Not only will you need to have an extension cable so you can play this in the toilet, you will also need another set of balls to play this in the toilet with the light off XD
Even though they didnt say these peripherals were needed you should get them(Diapers)(Something to hug so you can fall asleep at night)playing this at night = esc button simulator
