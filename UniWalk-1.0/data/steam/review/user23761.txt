If you've ever played a Moba you'll know that such games have a rather steep if rewarding learning curve.Awesomenauts manages to mitigate that often frustrating learning period somewhat and makes the overall experience more enjoyable.That said the game is no less competitive and is worth your time if you like the idea of a 2D platforming Moba style game.The main weakness compared to traditional Mobas is the smaller number of both items, abilities and heroes (I stress the word 'compared').However it makes up for it in the unique way it handles the former two.Instead of buying items you buy your skills and upgrades.The interesting thing here is that each ability can be upgraded in varying ways.A character's attack for example can be modified to either deal splash damage or heal allies thus leading to two very different play styles with the same character.In addition the platforming elements require a level of manuevering that is rare in it's competitors.The only other clear strength this game has over other Mobas are the map varieties (of which I feel is still somewhat small regardless of their differences) in the sense that they all play differently enough that strategies are developed for specific ones.DLC skins while nice feel overpriced (I admit I am guilty of buying one) and lag remains a large issue due to the 'skill shots' and platforming elements of such a game. Some games can get away with such things however a game that is so reliant on reflexes requires a better connection.Bots are at best useless and at worst detrimental to your team as they often die to competent players easily enough, thus providing an almost laughably easy source of currency.If you plan on getting the most out of Awesomnauts play with either a reliable internet connection or at the very least with friends.Bottom like is that even if you dislike Mobas in general, Awesomenauts does things differently enough that even those who normally don't enjoy the genre might enjoy it, perhaps at a discount if nothing else.Those that enjoy Mobas would feel that this is a casual but fantastic experience and will find that's it's a great way to introduce newcomers to the genre.I'd reccomend this game rather strongly.
