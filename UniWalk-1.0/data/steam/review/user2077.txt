Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad with Rising Storm is a fantastic game, it is who of my faves to play that is set in war time. the thing i like to do the most is basicly war where you fight in big battles to win a war, so you must fight up the map and capture points to win, there are two sides as you may already know and defending and attacting are both hard but very real. very much injoyed war game.
