yes.
If you are into visual novels with lots character development and character interaction that leaves an impact than this game is not really for you. But in retro-spect if you are planning on going to japan and are a male (wink wink, nudge nudge) then this will help you with things to do around the Tokyo region and Kyoto region with a slight romance story to break up all the travel facts and Japanese history. i would recomend this to people who are interested in traveling to Japan for a short period of time but not to people who are into highly thought out and developed visual novels unless you want something quick and easy to follow with only slight emersion. I'd give it about a 6 out of 10 because the romance aspect had some fairly well thought out moments and it gave me a good insite into sight seening in Tokyo and the regions around it.
