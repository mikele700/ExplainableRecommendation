I don't tend to do reviews for things, but I felt like I needed to do one for this game. Tales from the Borderlands is an ongoing episodic point-and-click video game based on the Borderlands series. Through the five episodes you encounter mind boggling decisions, mass violence, jokes and much more to meet your full satisfaction. You play as two main protagonists; Rhys, a Hyperion employee on the Hyperion space base and Fiona,  a con artist on Pandora with your main objective being, well opening another vault...From excellent music choices to start of each episode to cameos from previous personalities from all three of the Borderland games you grasp the nostalgic feel of the good old days of binge playing these games like I did. With season one wrapping up with *SPOILER*.............................. our main protagonists unlocking the hidden treasure of the vault and disappearing into thin air , this is to remain bugging the fans of the series and constantly checking on the updates so when we can get the countdown for season 2 all prime and ready. A must play if you're a fan of the Borderlands trilogy or a fan of previous Telltale games.
