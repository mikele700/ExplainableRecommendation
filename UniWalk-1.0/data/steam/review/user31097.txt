10/10 would pass the whiskey to myself again.... because I have no Friends :( Doesn't really matter who..... Who am I even talking to? oh yes you. Be my Friend.... I have Whiskey.... From all the people who Jumpkicked me in the face screaming HAVE SOME WHISKEY!
28 minutes in! And I find a Check T-shirt exactly like mine.... I love the game... Its in early access and its awesome... came across a team of bandits.... got held up and I go downstairs and they leave me supplies!.... Lesser valuble supplies but still supplies! Gameplay:Buggy but still playable... Loot is small but realistic in my opinion... maybe a few more drinks and cans every so often... Zombies are rare and powerful.... Weapons are Over-Powered and Loud, Not to mention hard to find... Weapon parts are fairly hard to find... but when you do they are almost always damaged...Gameplay rating: 6/10Players:Players are ♥♥♥♥♥..Player rating 4/10Visuals:Beautiful for a game in Early Access Alpha... Can be run on most PCs with 64-bit Windows... Still looks goodVisual rating: 8/10Overall Rating: 18/30
It's like.... Hell.... But Heaven.... But Hell.... No, Heaven... Wait. No Heaven... Definately Heaven... The guns shoot well and anyone can pick them up and get a kill....Plus they tie in well with the gameplay.... Tactics are heavy in this game.... You don't use tactics.... and you won't win... It's a simple as that..... Would recommend... 10/10 well.... maybe it is HELL!
For someone that has lived with depression and seen people commit. Or Even Tried/Thought about it.... It would most likely help.... I have had depression for a few years... Have thought about Commiting... It helped me a little... Took my mind off of it....
Not Call of Duty
my reaction to this game https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZepj6u5Dtc
Space Engineers is a Concept on Space, Survival in Space is a way to put it...You start off on a Platform with a Big Ship, A Miner Ship, A Constructor Ship and a Fighter Ship...Miner Ship: The Mining Ship is used for Mining Asteroids or other space rock. It has two Drills on the front that spin to crush and grind the rock. This useful for building Space Stations inside Rocks.Constructor Ship: The Constuctor Ship is used to weld parts to constructions. That is all (to my knowledge) it can do at present time.Fighter Ship: The Name Says it all, This ship is used for..... *GASP* FIGHTING...http://img.youtube.com/vi/qzPcMzy4WI8/1.jpgPros:-Good Mechanics-Nice Concept-Really sets the tone of..... Lost in Space.-Nice Controls-Looks SpectacularCons:-Glitchy-No Real Sense Of Direction (Could be considered both a Pro or a Con)-Community can be good.... Think of it as Left 4 Dead Community..... (when it was nice)-Takes a long time to connect to games. (even Singleplayer)Rating:7/10Worth Buying to Play with Friends
Really funny comments from the AI, Great spells, Great fun when killing time,I fireballed a Troll.... I then went on to get exploded by a cannon ball.... A Fairy revived me..... Sacrificing herself to save me....I cried..... Liek dis if you crie evertim....
