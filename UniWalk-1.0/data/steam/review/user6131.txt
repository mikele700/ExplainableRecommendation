Extremely addicting (for me). It's a great game to kill time and overcome boredom. Disassemble and assemble guns, even skeleton, cars and bike. I would be pleased if they add organ systems and anatomies of animals or insects (even birds) to the bonus game.
This game is as puny as it's name.
I regret everything right after i  played one match.
survive in this game for 10 minutes and i'll pay $10 for charity
