This is the reason I am waking up in the morning and going to bed in the morning. -10/10 IGN. Like Skyrim but too much Crowbar.-
The reason Half-Life 3 is needed like drugs in a rehab centre.
Ermaguerd!!! So fast paced and intense. I played with my friends for a whole day/night IRL cycle. This is the most fun and addictive game I have ever played. Slightly bugged but for a free to play game the ninja moves are worth it.
