This game used to be very fun and I used to play this game a lot. However, with recent patches, the game now requires much more grinding and removed the fun element of everyone having an equal chance. Players are able to exploit the system and this results in unfair gameplay. Some with CPU barely making the mark are battling people whose CPU is just under the mark. This is extremely unfair. Furthermore, this game is P2W, with many in-game compulsory stuff  having to be paid for. This game-'s -premium- is extremely overpowered, allowing new players to skip from a low-tier to a way higher-tier in mere hours. Clearly, this game has lost what made it unique and is now also P2W, something that I am sure the Steam community would not like as after all, this IS supposed to be a -Free-to-Play- game.
