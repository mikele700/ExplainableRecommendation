Very Fun game, better than most games, its simple but if you like blood and doing flips this is the game for you
This game is so great 10/10Actually.. I dont even own this gameDont even know why its letting me reviewBut i will sell my liver for some money to buy it
Piggy you are a scrub10/10 would say again
Terrible, I wish i could have my money backAll this game is is good graphics, but even then the frame rate seems incredibly low ( i have a fast computer )The Combat is terrible, the animations are so basic, and the voice acting is below average, it was a step back for the gaming industry
This was a hard game to review, it had pros and consThe multiplayer didnt have much the classes were terribleit was another fpsOn the other handit was differenthad great featuresbut the cons wayed out the pros
I Absolutely love this game!this is one of those games that you just have to have! If you love building, blowing things up and going to space then this is a game you need to have
