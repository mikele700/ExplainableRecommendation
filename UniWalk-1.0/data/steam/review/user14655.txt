Dat moment when you walk past a rock and turns out it wasn't a rock, just a ♥♥♥♥ing massive maggot.Yeah, it's good.
If you enjoy experiencing cancer through Smurfs, Trolls, A 1 in 500 chance to meet a grill and lucky spray pattern random headshots with the AK then this game is for you.If you don't then this game is also for you.21/10~IGN
 E3 2013: Interviewer: 'So there-'s alot of placeholders here?-Dean Hall(Founder of DayZ SA): 'Yeah alot of placeholders. Actually I-'m not happy with this building and other things, I think we might redo them completely from scratch.Meanwhile, my character silently drinks a unopened can of Soft Drink through his motorcycle helmet and then proceeds to die from jumping off a 2 metre barn floor. That-'s okay, still in Early Access. September 2015 in an interview: Interviewer: 'DayZ has been around for a while. Ummmm, It is, creeping up to a Beta maybe?-Brian Hicks(New DayZ Lead Producer): 'Yeah we-'re getting there, we-'re getting towards our goal. We-'re still aiming for the end of this year. It-'ll probably get pushed maybe a month, maybe two AT MOST -Meanwhile, April 25th, 2016 and my character STILL drinks a unopened can of Soft Drink with slightly better animations, sound effects(not 100% guarranteed every time you drink), but STILL through my helmet. It has been 2 years. All you have changed is the price of the game and I-'m sitting here wondering how a guy is shooting me through his fists....With an invisible gun.-Early Access they say-, -Test the game they say-. Okay Rocket, I-'ll run halfway across the map in order to get decent gear, only to die from a game of -'who can press spacebar the quickest to bring out their gun-. Thanks.However, this does not mean the game isn-'t fun, it just means when the game gets boring, it gets REALLY boring. Play with a group of friends(for fun, not seriously or you-'ll regret it) and you-'ll have a blast(majority of the time).tl;dr: Good game. ♥♥♥♥ development.
