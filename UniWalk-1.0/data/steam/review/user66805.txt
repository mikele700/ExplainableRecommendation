Forgive me if i did anything wrong cuz this is my first time writing a review. Some people say that this game is pay 2 win. But trust me, you can still survive without paying with real money. All you need is teamwork.The guns doesn't have that much difference except the firing speed and control. Its quite complicated if your new to third person cover shooters. But, as you progress,it'll be easy to get killstreaks. You also buy your grenades so you won't see people spamming grenades like crazy. Also, this game has some cool abilities exclusive to each class. You can fry  your enemies with your mini U.F.O thing, or you can scan where your enemies are through an opaque things like walls or cars.(sadly, you can't peek through their clothes....Im just joking!).You can also put a shield around you so that you can go out in the open without taking a bullet in the face. Overall, this game has alot of potential. You should definitely try it.And a little tip: Mystery boxes have some cool or poopy loot in them. So if you want to gamble and you have money (not real world money) to spare, try to buy a couple of them :)
