Ouch...
I like the game, but in my last hours of playing it, the game became stail and and also boring, and the only fun times are when you find raging kids that want to unlock heads. And servers with no VAC are just horrible, hackers on every corner, but i still love the game. I look forward to playing this again when they added new things.9/10
♥♥♥♥ THIS PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥ GAME HOLY ♥♥♥♥ KILL ME 10/10
I love the solid gameplay but servers have to inprove! 7/10
Hours and hours spent on this game with my bud, your gonna have fun panicing on low health. Becarful, when you die you loose all your stuff.
Hours and hours of feeling like a badass, hours wasted playing this game, well worthit, especially with the dlc.
