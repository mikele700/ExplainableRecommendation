I cant even describe the feeling that i've got when i played this game first time. At this time i was 8, and i couldnt believe... the graphics, weapons, NPCS, foes and friends, water, and great narrative, musics, physics (well a little bit fun at this point, but what can i say for a 2004 game?)The best serie i've ever played, please the hole sequence and have a lot of entreteinment!Good luck!
