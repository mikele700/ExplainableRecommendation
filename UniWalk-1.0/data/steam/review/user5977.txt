I enjoyed Payday 2 and pre-ordered it. Played the hell out of it until things got stale and  the flow of DLCs starting coming in, I bought them initially, even though I might not have touched some of them. But more and more paid DLCs kept coming in. So ok... fine, the contents were good, so I guess why wouldn't people want to pay for the DLCs for extra characters, weapons and all that?Then PD2 decided to become P2W with the microtransaction. Grindday2 became Greedday 2. Nope, not supporting this anymore. That was a lowball move that managed to alienate me.
It's called Grindframe for a reason. The cake is a lie, but not the grind. The grind is true.Who does not want to be a space ninja jumping around, wall running, doing cool acrobatics and slicing enemy fodders to half? Played it since closed beta, stopped for a few months when the grind got unbearable. Returned when there's major updates, stop again. Rinse and repeat. Started playing again and this time I put the platinum and my trading skills to good use to get those cool gold Prime weapons I never gotten in the past because I never ran any void with random people. Game's been more mindlessly enjoyable with the ability to do Void now and get some Prime weapons, whether to farming or trading. Other than that, there's nothing much to this game, you grind, you wait for events, wait for Baro Ti'Keer the swindler, wait for rare alerts. That's about it.  An Eight out of Tenno.
