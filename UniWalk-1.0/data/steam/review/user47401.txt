I have no idea what people are talking about when they say the game crashes because it has not crashed once for me. I run it as low settings and 720x480 because I am running integrated graphics and the game still looks great. The story is rubbish but the gameplay is excellent
Ok game but not worth $15 in my opinion. Get this game when its on sale or from a discount website.
