It's very hard to find a game with such compelling ideals, philisophies and idealogies. This review is not so much a reflection of what how the game function but more about what it provides for the gamer. Bioshock 2, is indoubtly one of a prime classics in our gaming generation of today, if you haven't picked it up yet I highly reccommend doing so. No spoilers here but, the game takes you on a journey and a mystery as you find yourslef constantly asking questions what happened to the rapture? why have the people gone mad? why, when, what, how? I'm writing from a perspective that seeks a game to be more of a game, rather an interactive, immersive narrative. Do graphics still matter to this day an age, some would argue however, none would say this is a shallow experience but rather it is a deep and enriching piece of art. Bioshock 2 will remain to be one of the pinnacles of innovative story telling, but that's just my own opinion, please pick up this game.
Truly the original roots of the M.O.B.A genre :D
