Great game.  Very good use of episodic story telling, leaves you wanting more and hanging out for the next release.  Would recommend to anyone.
Your typical Batman game.  Not as great as Arkham Asylum but still a good solid game.  Has replayability in the form of challenge modes, I wish like most games the hardest difficulty was unlocked when you get the game, rather then when you finish the game.
