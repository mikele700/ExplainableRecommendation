Seeing as though the devs are deleteing all negative feedback from the forums guess id better place my thoughts here.Heroes and Generals is a very ambitous game with some great aspects, Its fun to play and will keep you entertained for hours.Here comes the butThe Developers of this game are so unbelivably bad at what they do, the greatest weakpoint of the game is them. After they decided to shaft all the vets with massive restrictions they then proceeded to sweep all negative reviews under the rug. Reto-moto is some Hitler level corrupt.It seems every decsions they make for the game was made by highschool footballers high on dope-WOAH BRO THAT SOUNDS DOPE, LETS NOT PUT ANY THOUGHT INTO IT AND JUST DO WHAT WE WANT ON IMPULSE-Do not under any circumstance play this game......you will leave feeling like an empty void of dissapoinment
