Dont know why people dislike this so much :P I enjoy it to be honest. It'd be so much better though with dedicated servers, and if not so many players camp on tdm especially :P Perhaps everyone hated it because there were so many hackers after its release. I've only been playing it for a couple of months after buying a computer that can run it xD WIsh there were more Aussie players on it too.
