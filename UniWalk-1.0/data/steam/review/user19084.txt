Portal 2 was an instant clasic for me. I've used this game asa benchmark for other first-person puzzlers, and with the ability to not only play the main story, but also play user created levels, there is litteraly endless enjoyment to be had with this game
This is a great game, fast paced, constantly changing, never knowing what to expect next.
