i cant even get into a match. i dont know if its my internet or what. my friends tried joining a server and they had the same problem i had. we sat here for half an hour waiting for it to load
Out of all my time on smite. I still have yet to run into a match where I do bad, could it be possible that loki is that good?
this game is amazing
