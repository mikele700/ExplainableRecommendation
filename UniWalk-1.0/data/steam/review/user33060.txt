This game tell grinding to go grind itself and brings in a new era for MMO's, this game gives you one character for the liftime of your account then it sends you in, after you complete the starter missions it sends you off with a little over 30000 uc, some gear and a few weapons, then its up to you to choose your destiny, want to be a trader? Do it, want to kill other players for money set byt other players? Do it, Want to shoot every critter from here to pluto? Do it, the graphics arnt great, gameplay is slow, addictiveness is HIGH like a bird on drugs, oh and no skill points for you, just select a skil, give it time and BAM you now can use a sniper rifle, I am only early in this game but I allready see that this game is very addictive and well, say goodbye to sleep, Ive got people to kill.
Crusader Kings 2 or CK2 is a seriousley indepth game, you have to have a causes beli to wage wr and well the muslims have got it preety damn bad when the holy wars begin that the pope (the pope who didnt let me invade France, ♥♥♥♥) decides all muslims are asshats and invades for well no reason what so ever, then ♥♥♥♥ goes down especially since the muslims and theeir ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed horse archers bring the pain on the christians (also if your inexperianced do NOT play the lewis) there are multiple faiths like christianity or orthadox, hell you can even be the only jewish ruler in the whold game (good lcuk) but overall CK2 is a great game and i have even talked about the character devolpment and family areas of the game
