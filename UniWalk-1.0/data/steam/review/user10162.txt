A enlightening game with the sound of Beautiful 8-bit music that matches your gameplay.What more could you ask for, it's a simple game but isn't too easy because it has challenges but that what makes it fun.A must have in any Steam Library.
This game was fun at first in it-'s early access stage with developments and new characters back in 2013. But long time ago the developers completely abandoned this game since it wasn-'t getting very popular. All that-'s left now is some mulitplayer servers of the same game since it-'s abandonment. In addition the community isn-'t exactly a nice bunch either.I would not suggest getting this game at all at this point since no this game will have no more additions. Once you basically -master- the game there is nothing to work towards to or look forward to.
