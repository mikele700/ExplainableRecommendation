I can't understand why anyone wouldn't play this. Just amazing.
A really fun game for people who want to go back to the old days and say that Modern Military Shooters are for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.This game is still in development and it may still have some issues. I had a problem with the game when i was going to the steam interface multiple times. but i think everything else runs great.but it's not hard to recommend this game, even in it's development stage.It's an amazing experience for anyone who belongs in the classic genre.Now, Do you know where we can get some health packs? Oh! There's one!
Pros:have mercyTHERE'S FINALLY A GNU/LINUX VERSIONCons:no gnu/linux supportoriginal postYou can play Genocide to kill off 33% of the replay value forever. 10/10
pros:-Fun and challenging gameplay (i dunno see for yourself)-Looks godlike even to this day.-requires less ram than ps vita ports (Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus: Shōjo-tachi no Shōmei requires 6GB of RAM for a game that doesn't look or feel very resource intensive. Infact, that game looks like it belongs on PS3 even for the PC version, and the PS3 has 256MB(!) of RAM. Even DOOM (the new one) had a reason to use 6GB+ of memory.)cons:-Limited activations.-Doesn't load on my computer (SteamOS, Windows 7, GTX 950, AMD A4-7300, 8GB RAM) for some odd reason.-No GNU/Linux version.

Praise the lord for this very simplistic game not having microtransactions!
I have played this for 16 hours and still enjoyed every single bit of this 6 Player co-op shooter.
