a game to just simply have fun, esspecially when you get better guns and just enjoying the burning bandits and phycos 9/10
a great new way to look at a zombie apocolypse and there are points in the game that just push you to the edge
this game is one of my faveorite games in my game library and for the very small price you do get  a lot plus it's a small easy pass the time kind of game so when im bored i just do an hour or two play this
really good game for anybody. A great game to start with 1st person shooters.
