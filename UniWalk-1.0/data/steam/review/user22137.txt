As someone who has enjoyed previous Plainswalkers games I was very suprised to see  what seemed like a high quality MTG game go free to play on steam. I was getting ready to finally be able to show friends who were into other TCG's why MTG is one of the greatest around and why Blue/White is anoying as balls. However as it is right now, the game is basically unplayable. The online servers have not once been avaliable in the time I've attempted to play, which is close to an hour of game time wasted as all single player quests and tutorials completed while offline do not get saved, not even locally. I understand we have no reason to really complain as we haven't paid for anything, however I feel as if Stainless Games has a lot to answer for. This game and its servers are no where near up to an industry acceptable standard.
