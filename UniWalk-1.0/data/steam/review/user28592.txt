I don't like gas stamps, that's about all. 7/10
Prepare for an immeserive combat experience where you get to live and breathe what it-'s like to be apart of a Covert Terrorist Operation, or what it-'s like to stop one. Experience first hand the problems that they they have to face during duty such as insults like -You filthy Casual-, -♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that didn-'t hit-, and the countless reminder that your mum is a ♥♥♥♥. Overall 9/10 Great game, Great guns, Bad people
One of the best racing games I've ever played. Pure arcade racing to the bone, if you like fast, good looking cars doing what they do best, this game is the perfect gem for you :) (Side note: Co-op is fun as well)
Yes, game good, much fun
