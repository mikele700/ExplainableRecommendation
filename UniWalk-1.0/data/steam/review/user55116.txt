It's a pretty nice and fun game, personally it got my attention for a long time, SADLY i don't have enough patience to play it all the way through, it's pretty solid, has nice graphics and you can run it at a graphic setting without much requirements.It runs greatly andis easy to learn, if you like these kind of games you'll love this one. There sometimes are desync issues with the server (ALWAYS ONLINE) which can be annoying but not a major problem.
i love it, fast paced combat, hand drawn animations, amazing combos and well balanced, reccomended to all of those who like fighting games
is multiplayer berry gud
