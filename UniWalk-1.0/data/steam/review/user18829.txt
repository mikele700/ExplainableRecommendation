DLC to Dawn of War, Dark Crusade is a fantastic and recommended addition for Warhammer 40k and RTS fans alike. I can safely say that if you purchased and enjoyed the original Dawn of War, this and Winter Assault will provide memorable moments and worthy content to spend hours on, noob or veteran. With the addition of a new campaign system that allows you to play from the persepctive of the various factions including new ones, the souless, relentless Necrons and the technologically advanced Tau which are both interesting and well thought out. Has good replay value, this review was written with my reinvigorated passion for an RTS that just ticks all the right boxes, especially and most importantly because of the efforts of Relic, who have made countless classics (Except for that darn, rehashed Company of Heroes 2). To you, the anonymous gamer reading this review, yes you. I say you will not be disapointed. Note: I am not a monkey on a typewriter who was bribed a bunch of bannanas to write this review.
