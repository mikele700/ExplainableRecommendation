Medieval II: Total Warâ„¢ Kingdoms is a turn based strategy focusing on building up an empire and achieving total domination.It allows you to choose from several historical factions each with special units, strengths, weaknesses and play styles. Further factions are unlockable following completion of the the Grand Campaign.Total War Kingdoms strongest feature is the real time battles, put a city under siege and send ladders to the wall or attack from afar with catapults, trebuchets and later in the game, powerful canons. Defend your town and cities with a well timed cavalry charge to disable enemy siege weapons and rain down flaming arrows upon the counter-attack.The ability to control each unit individually makes for practically unlimited strategy and the ability to destroy armies that on paper appear much stronger.The turn based city building side of the game also allows for a lot of strategic play, build advanced barracks, archery ranges and stables in castles, and increase revenue by upgrading towns to cities and so-forth.This mode can get a bit tedious in the later game simply because of the amount of organising necessary, but there are options to auto-manage these.Overall the balance between the slow pace of the city building mode and the fast real time battles is such that you can lose hours as your empire slowly gobbles up it's enemies and neighbouring factions. Addictive.The amount of forethought and planning reminds me of chess, in that you need to think a few turns ahead to make the most of your armies.8/10
