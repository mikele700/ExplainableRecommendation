A game itself that requires teamwork, communication and skill. I had some games which people are friendly, even though we are from opposing teams. Most games I've ever played had people talking crap about other people's ethnic, cultures and race. I will never understand why people blame others for loosing just because they're from Russia, Phillipines, South America (especially people in South East Asia, I'm looking at you). We're all just people sitting in front of a computer playing the same game. Yes, for the first few games we may be bad at it, but with each game, we learn from our mistakes , we take advices from our fellow teamates and become better. Guys, if we could be a little more polite, we could make the Dota community a better place and a better game for everyone to play instead of being immature by calling names or sh**talking others.
