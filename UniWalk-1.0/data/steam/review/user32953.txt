May as well buy the original from 1999 on CD This 'remake' is a simple texture upgrade with less content than the original. i tend to play the battle scenes on slightly faster speed but this makes the textures screw up when the monsters are moving, unless if i slow the animation down to a speed which is slower than fingernail growth the monsters look like garbage, would like a refund please.
