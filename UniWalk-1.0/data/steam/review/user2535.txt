Doto of the ancients > LoLegend league of Legends10/IV would play again, best fps in today's scientific community
This is possibly the best tactical FPS i've ever played.Insurgency provides hours of fun and it also looks fabutabulous. It has amazing gunplay and guns, fantastic supression mechanics and somewhat good people.This game is a 10/10, no questions asked.
Buy it and feel bad when a stupid ♥♥♥♥ing robot kills your dudes.It's really good.
I rate it R8/Revolver
A great game with excellent gameplay, hours of fun and a good turn based system of doing practically everything.A must have if you've got hours to spare.
Buy it, i don't care what you have to say, just buy it.It's worth the three dollars so just ♥♥♥♥ING BUY IT.
