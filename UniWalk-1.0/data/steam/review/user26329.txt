A charming indie game well worth a playthrough (or 8).
If you enjoyed the likes of Minecraft, Terraria, Dont Stave and the plethora of in-degvelopment/early access sandbox titles stop reading reviews and buy this game!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------That beign said I'll do my best to pull out what it is that makes this one of my all time favorite games. This review will be updated as the Beta progresses. You are an explorer of the stars, a procedurally generated universe waits before your eyes, near infinite planets, monster, weapons and experiences await you all form the comfort of your own spaceship! I gladly give it a 10/10, and its very much deserving of a spot in my favorite games of all time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are a handful of races to pick from with the decision actually making some difference in that each race has their own spaceship and their own interpretation of the things you encounter dring your travels (using the analyze tool 'n')There are numerous different planet types as well as near infinite monsters and weapons thanks to the marvel that is procedural generation further increasing the desire to travel the universe in search off 'all of the things' so to speak. During your travels expect to come across friendly and unfriendly sentient races in the form of villages and dungeons. Races such as the robotic glitch, sentient robots trapped in a medievil type state, or the floran, savage plant people with a slightly backwards society. Every race can be found during your travels going about there lives, running shops, farming etc and greatly increases the immersion within the game itself. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Some notes on the state of the beta as of 11/03/2014At the moment the content is a little on the lacking side (compared to the scope mapped out on the roadmap, available on the starbound website) but the devs have shown since release there dedication not just adding there own ideas to the game, but also incorporating popular mods being produced by the massive and ever growing community already present. The progression of the game at the moment is a placeholder waiting to be properly implemented until a later stage of beta, once all the systems are incorperated. Currently players progress by tiers of ore but eventually this will be replaced with three branching paths allowing for three compeltely unique playstyles. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks for reading :)!-JohnnyTAA
Absolutely one of the best games I've ever played, I can not recoment it enough. The game is so ambitious and It is the first open world game i've played that feels dense, detailed and 'alive' for lack of a better term. Truly an experience every gamer should try. I have been totally blown away by the scope of Fallout 4 and know that I will be playing it for years to come. 10/10
Easily one of the best multiplayer experiences you can have, so much fun, hat collectors rejoice.
It is perfect.
