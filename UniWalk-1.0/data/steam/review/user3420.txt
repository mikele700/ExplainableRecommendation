This game is broken and not worth the $20. It is impossible to play or even enjoy in its current state. It has sat in my library for over a year and nothing has changed.
This game is so fun, difficult and still in early acess. My computer has trouble running it though, and the latest update made it impossible, for i need compatability mode to play. All in all, it started great, and it seems that they have even greater things in store.
