Best game ever. 10/10
I would highly recommend this fantastic wilderness survival game. Unique in every way, this game is very entertaining and rewarding. I simply cannot wait for Don't Starve Together to be released.
It is a really fun game alone or with some friends. There are basically no limitations to this game so what are you waiting for? Go ahead and buy this magnificent game.
It would be nice to know where my life went. Really good game 10/10.
