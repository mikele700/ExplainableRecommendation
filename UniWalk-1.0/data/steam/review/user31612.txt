it's more click andforget  as it auto plays out. extreamly mindless
no strategey, no simulation, not a game.
buged, dose not work. there never going to fix it
expecting other things from delvament blogs, i got really pulled in by the story set up.
i was hopping i could take the rules for the shape of crumple zone in the over all shape of a shell and make it look better then the crap we get today when limited by the need of those zones. but shells are set in this game and changes to looks might as well be nothing. and so you cant take a longer car and bring it down to a small car or bulge side areas extra, and not all shell shapes are there.also if this -game- has any bearing on how real car-'s dev are put together it dose a lot to explain why we get so many bad cars. and why car companies get so proud to announce when they combine each part to get an product that dose not blow up, and this game is infact good for being just like it.but if not it need-'s a lot more work put in, maybe make it so you can look up by parts that affect each part, so if you want to get something higher and lower you can look outside of the part blowing up / under performing in it-'s area.

crafting is really hard, offten hard to tell what's going to happen when makeing a new spell, so far i keep makeing fireballs that do 0 dmg.
bad pc  and controler button set up. firing grenades and other item selection is clumsy lumped together extra
the only thing that could go wrong is how the comunitty grows.
