I first encountered this game 5 or 6 years ago when a friend gave it to me on a flash drive.  It was hours and hours of fun, and I am truly glad to see it on the Steam store.  I wholeheartedly reccomend this game to anyone looking for a quick bit of fun, any roguelike enthusiasts, and any strategy gamers out there.  It has a simple framework, but allows for a significant amount of complex, strategic gameplay.Give this game a try!  You won't be dissapointed.
