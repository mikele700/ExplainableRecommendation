10/10, Best banana slipping simulator EU
Game Of The Year
This game is the most terrifying of the series without a doubt, if your looking to get yourself scared then this game is for you! Turning a light on has never been more creepy! And you'll get what I mean when you play....
A game that gave me an immersive experience like no other. A game that although you may nedd a walkthrough with here and there, is on hte edge of perfect....HL3 pls
It's a great game, but really don't expect to get 100% Dem riddler trophies take 3 playthroughs of time after your finished with the story...But otherwise, GOTY title is very well deserved!
Australia and Germany's main political statistics according to the game are vegimite and beer consumption......Canada...Canada has moose population...
Kinda like slender, except you may need more pants... A lot more pants...As a matter of fact, I want you to rob every pants factory in a 30 mile radius of your home... ...and guess what...                                             ...THERE PROBBALY AREN'T ANY!...Congratualtions, your playing Five Nights At Freddy's WITHOUT PANTS!!!........I hope you can clean the chair after 10/20 mode...PS: Slender is much less scarier, play that, requires less pants too
This game is awesome! If your thinking of buying this game, it's worth every cent you spend. Plus, the soundtrack is beast!
Like a 2D-3D version of Terarria.Unique, hard, time-consuming and fun!
