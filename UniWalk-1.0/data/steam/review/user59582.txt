'Merica's Number #1 Hat Simulator. Nuff said.
This game is a fast-paced awesome MULTIPLAYER game.The multiplayer is captilized because that is the huge fault of this game, when your waiting for players this is the worst game but when you have at least 4 people on a server it's an insanely fun game.WARNING: It has a steepish learning curve (use the internet for tutorials)
