This game beats the pants of morrowind and oblivion!
Kojima's latest work is a masterpeice like usual, buy this game you get so much content for the price.
It's fun plays like a metal gear solid game should, but I still whished it played more like snake eater still great tho. Excellent port it plays like a damn fiddle! Awsome grahpics and no peasant framerates.  Best part was when paz fell out the helicopter and blew up.
This game is the best Final Fantasy game and PS1 game for a resaon, it's perfect nothings wrong with it, well worth your 12 bucks.
Computer drivers are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s but thats what makes it so fun!
Puts mario kart shame because it has better visuals characters and more fast paced game play.
This game is good for eveything!
