I really enjoyed this reinterpretation of the TR franchise. Gone are the frustrating explorations of mostly empty and pointless levels, and in comes a great flow between stealth, exploration and combat sequences.Lara starts out as a very naive young woman. For the beginning of the game, she is completely unsure of herself and appears to nearly give up time and again. You get to play her as she becomes the experienced fighter we know. As her skill tree unlocks, her personality becomes more determined and resolute to the point that she can beat any odds. Well worth the play time.
