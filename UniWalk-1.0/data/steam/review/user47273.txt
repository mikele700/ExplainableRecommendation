I love the older feel to this game; it reminds me of the many similar games I used to play growing up (Legend of Zelda, Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana...). It also brings a lot more creation to you for your character, allowing you to customise your appearance and choose the way you level your abilities/skills (one of the main reasons I love RPGs). Not to mention that you can play with 3 other people, who make their own unique characters too. My brother and I bought this game yesterday and have had a blast playing it together, which was quite helpful as some of the boss fights would be a real pain by myself; farming for crafting materials too.Of coarse it is still in the beta and there are a few paths that are blocked off as the next map has literally not been added to the game yet, but my concern at this point, is worry for how big this game will be; My brother and I haven't played that long (though it has been a few hours) and it appears that we are about halfway through the story. You can have up to nine characters, but there isn't a whole lot you can do different between plays (you can make it more difficault and play alone for a real challenge or try a different build for your character) and I fear I may get board once I've finished the game once or twice, but thats just me; others might like shorter games.Having said that, I have no idea what the creators plan and what plot twist there could be, which could have this game spiralling much deeper and longer than it appears; my hope is for a game at least as long as the games I mentioned above. It is in beta after all, and so far I love this game.
