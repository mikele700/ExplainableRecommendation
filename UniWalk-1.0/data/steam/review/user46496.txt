A great little game. Took 3 hours to beat on normal, and theres still a new game+, duel mode, and arcade mode. The shooting is fluid, with plenty of action. The narration is witty as well, with the scenery changing as the narrator remembers part of the story. There is also 3 different skill paths to take, either shotgun, rifle, or duel pistols. All in all, a great game.
Can't play with one hand, cutscenes not animated. 0/10
