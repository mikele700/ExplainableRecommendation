I have played all the other gemcraft games, and I can assure you that this still holds true to the series excellence. There is still insane amounts of content, some for beginners and more for the more dedicated players. Endurance mode still exists, and plenty of other modifiers to the game to make it more difficult for more rewards, and of course there is still a wide variety of gems with different powers to choose from. There are also easy keyboard shortcuts to make upgrading, bombing and combining easier.This is the absolute best tower defence series available.
