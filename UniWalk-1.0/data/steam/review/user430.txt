I fully stand by MY product
Everyone is complaining how ♥♥♥♥ this game is. Its really not that bad, in fact it is really good. you guys are all saying that it crashes and it has a million glitches, it has not crashed for me, i play this game on ultra high settings, i get 60fps. dont listen to these other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s writing these reviews. all i can say about this game is, have a more then capable computer, i have a intel i5 4460 processor, windows 8.1 and a gtx 960, this game IS good, just need to fix a few glitches and optimize the game alittle better
its gay
