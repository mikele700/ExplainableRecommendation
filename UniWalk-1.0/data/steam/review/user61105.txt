The only WWI game that flows like the war it is based on, where as others are simply a skin Verdun though game play, environments, weapons and tactics/formations gives that static stuck in the mud feel that really pins the first war.  The maps are also interesting with your typical treeless miles of crater filled mud where only the quick of feet survive , half destroyed fortresses , trenches with players struggling in close quarter combat with pistols, grenades and bayonets, french farm land where men charge and die for a little more than 100 yards of corn only to reach trench on the other side  Not to mention that one reason I like this game is the use of automatic weapons is ether restricted to realistic levels or having disadvantages such as not being able to fire until deployed or having horrid hip fire accuracy.  If your interested in  -History of the great war (western front aka trenches in France) -first person shooters in a take and hold sort of game play -getting shell shock -wearing gas masks -using wacky weapons -having PTSD  your likely have fun with this game  Turn the gore on full you won't thank me for the PTSD but you will for immersion. 
Youâ€™re in space with weapons and unlimited opportunity what else do you need
