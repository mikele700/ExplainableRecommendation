Great gamelove it to bitsit kills me (no pun intended) to give this game a bad reviewfirst things first, this is a great game, great combat system great world design, enemy design and is just overall brilliant.however, this is one of the WORST PC ports to date, in fact, i could even check the damage scaling on my weapons with plugging in my controller and pressing x on them. On top of that, sooooo many errors with the lock-on system (which is necessary if you want to play a caster build), some of the worst hitboxes i've ever seen, enemy ai problems and large problems with the rolling mechanic (which is neccessary to the game).I'm not saying this is a bad game, i just want you to know what you are getting when you buy this game
