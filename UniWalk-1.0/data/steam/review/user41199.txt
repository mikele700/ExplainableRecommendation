great game, very fast paced and addictive gameplay. chanracter models might not be your thing but then again it's refreshing to have a female cast that isn't over sexualised like crazy. definately recommend if you enjoy fast pased, shoot em' up style games
if you liked titain quest you'll love this!!
if you liked limbo you'll love this! same mechanics with a much more ominous theme. would definately reccommed
hands down the most broken port i've ever played. the reason steam strongly recomends a controler is because none of the icons have been changed for pc and the keyboard layout is terriable. i had to download a mod to get it to play at the right resoloution and it doesn't screen tear to ♥♥♥♥. also on windows 8 it still runs of games for windows, i need another mod to fix that. almost nothing has been optimised for pc. wish i'd spent the  extra cash and got dark souls 2 instead
