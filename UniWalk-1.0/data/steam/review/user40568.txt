So much fun playing Saints Row The Third, everytime I came back to play it, never gets old. To be honest, I prefer to play Saints Row 2 more than the Third because of Saints Row 2's wide range of weapons customisation. Overall, interesting storylines, excellent gameplay and fresh change of venue from the previous Saints Row.
