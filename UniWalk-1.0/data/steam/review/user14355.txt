Painfully frustrating game.There is no way to tell the talent of a player when you recuit them, some basic scouting would make this game far more enjoyable. There seems to be little or no effect of coaching. Batting is a joke with seemingly your team going out LBW 4-5 times per innings, the wicket keeper drops ever catch when bowling (again no way to tell of his actual keeping ability), the bowlers get hit for 4's constantly when bowling defensive... GO figureDon't waste your time trying to figure it out, go play a soccer management sim at least there you can recruit and develop players and have some actual idea of their skill level.
If you love deleting abandoned buildings, then this is the game for you! Spend half your time building a city and half your time deleting abandoned buildings or ones that have burnt down
