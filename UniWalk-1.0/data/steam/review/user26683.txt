Picked this up during the 2016 summer sale, good christ it's addicting to play and the soundtrack is top notch!
It's great fun, up until a fellow tribe member pisses off a Brontosaurus, that responds by immediately destroying you and  everything you loved, such as my parasaur...and house.... and prized dino fecal stash. 10/10 would become dino Purée again.
Why does this even exist.

The soundtrack alone is enough to make me recommend this game.
