I don't even know where to start with this game. I'm pretty sure by now, everyone who WANTED to play this game has either heard of it or played it already. Firstly it looks amazing. The graphics look superb, especially for being made on a 9 year old engine, it is truly astonishing. Secondly, gameplay. I've played this game, many, MANY, times over, and I'm still not sick of the gameplay elements. It's that good. Honeslty, as long as I have a PC, I will be replaying this game. Leading onto replayability. Portal 2 has lots. Ever since the Perpetual Cooperative Testing Initiative, and the addition of the Steam Workshop, there has never been so many reason to go back and play Portal 2, whether it be playing top rated chambers from the workshop, or discovering how socialable you are in cooperative. This game will become a classic, in generations to come. I just wish that Valve would make another masterpiece like it. It is one of the best games I have ever played. And unlike the Cake, that is no lie my fellow gamers.
