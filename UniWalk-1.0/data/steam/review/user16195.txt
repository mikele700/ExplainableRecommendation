What to say about Bioshck Infinte? Okay, well the first thing we see is an abandonded lighthouse and a kinda ominous and obviously shady deal. If this doesn-'t make it already stand out then i don-'t know what does. I went into this game thinking -Oh great another boring shooter with no story- but oh dear god I was wrong. You play through the game and soon start to reakise that something in Collumbia isn-'t quite right especially when it comes to the girl you-'ve rescued- Elizabeth. An intense and twisted story that still has me blown away and each time I replay it I see more and more of the dots connect. The Protagonist (you) isn-'t a completly generic pile of code and actually has an interesting story that starts to take a turn for the worst. The vigors and great vareity of weapons keep the gameplay interesting, not to mention the different enimies that are thrown at you and seem to both challenge you and also set the tone of the city for you. A very dislikable antagonist with one hell of a backstory. The game is beautiful and with it set in 1912 and all it makes it seem like the stunning floating city of Columbia is un-phased by your intense havoc with bright colours that make the game seem comical in a strange way. The colour pallets can change within seconds from browns and golds to blacks and greys all of which perfectly complement the mood. Oh yeah and Elizabeth isn-'t completley uselss as she scavenges salts, coins and ammo to aid your in your battles or she can just you know tear a whole through space and time to just give you what you need (yep). So incase ypu couldn-'t tell by this HIGHLY positive review, I fiercly recommend this game; it was my game of the year last year and is perhaps my favourite game of all time-10/10
