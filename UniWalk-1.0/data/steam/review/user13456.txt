$6.29 for one new heist and a few weapons? No thanks. This game still has bugs that need fixing, an infamy mechanic that needs more work, and more attention to tweaking gameplay mechanics. Do yourself and consumers as a whole a favor, and wait until it's atleast 75% off steam. This is just an attempt to cash in.
This is how EVERY SINGLE QUEST in this game plays out...Talk to -so and so-, find a location and shoot everything that is there.ORTalk to -so and so-, find a location, shoot everything that is there and then loot -insert object-.The game almost never deviates from these two gameplay aspects. There is practically zero choice in how you decide to approch quests, other than choosing which gun you use to kill things with. It literally doesn-'t matter what you choose to say during dialogue choices either. All -choices- will lead to the NPC saying the same bloody thing - no matter if you-'re rude, polite or sarcastic.I cannot recomend this game out of good conscience to anyone who thinks they-'ll be playing an RPG. It-'s a first person shooter, through and through.
