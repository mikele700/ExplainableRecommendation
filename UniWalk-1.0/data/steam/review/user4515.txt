This is a very good game for many reasons but it can get quite repetitive and there are a lot of dlc BUT! It is a very good game and very fun with friends!
This game is amazing!!! Super fun! Plus the modders will make it even better! But right now the game runs like ♥♥♥♥, my game has crashed about 3-5 times and the fps drops sometimes to like 12 or 20. When the devs fix this, this game will be amazing!! But it is day 1 so calm down guys just it will be fixed!
Emily is a ♥♥♥♥♥, she is acting nice and ♥♥♥♥ but she is a ♥♥♥♥♥.
