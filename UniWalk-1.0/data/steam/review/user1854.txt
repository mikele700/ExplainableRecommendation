The only game that loses my boredom.
OKAY THIS IS THE REAL REVIEW OF MINE.I started playing CS:GO somewhere in 2014. It was fun at the start, also competitive with stupid silvers (no offense to those silvers who are new im also silver 1 but with big ♥♥♥ stats). Let me talk about competitive5v5 IS INTENSE! I LOVE IT. YET PEOPLE IN SILVERS DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOPERATE.WHY I'M STILL SILVER 1 FOR 2 MONTHS? OH CMON I KEEP PLAYING THIS GAME ALL DAY.
This game is full of -cheats- in online. RIP my gta 4mil money
