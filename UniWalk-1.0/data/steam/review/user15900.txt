It's fine I guess.
Awesome game that makes me want to play it again on a harder difficulty. A very memorable(though confusing) story with great characters and good gameplay, I definitely recommend Bioshock Infinite to both fans of the original Bioshock and newer players.P.S You can eat potatoes from a toilet what is there to not love about this game
1000/10 gunsMust buy
