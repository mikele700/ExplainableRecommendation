This game is a whole new experience to me as a professional mlg quickscoper. Comparing this game to its rivals such as Team Fortress 2, Tomb Raider and Dota 2. This game stands as a clear winner. Everything about this game is just perfect, from character progression to complicated world designs. This game is revolutionary, some might say, to me...This game is more than that, it's the purpose of life. This game taught me how to live life to the fullest potential and fight for dreams that matter most. Overall this game has nice graphics (5/21) and great sound (9/11), sounds even better on 7.1. For $0.02 that I got for free, this game is a clear winner. Waiting for GOTY edition.
