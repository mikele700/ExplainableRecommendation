I'll tell you something about this game, it's beautiful, with breathtaking scenarios, and a simple but deep story, wich made me cry in the end, i've taken 2 hours to end the game but it was the most philosophical and thrilling hours of my life until now.I really enjoyed my experience with this game, wich will be inside me forever, mainly because I have a younger brother, and we fight a lot, so i can say: this game changed my life.Absolutely recomended!!!
