trust me guys, this game is a must buy
if you are looking to become a piece of meat hiding behind a wall, then look no furtherthis game will give you PTSD faster than any other game
Dont even bother.
i have never played a game so worth my time as this one, plus the fact that it is free, although there are mini-transactions, but they are optional, but really, I believe any gamer interested in air battles or not will enjoy this game, also it isnt the finished production yet and in the future they will be adding land and naval battles, i promise you will enjoy it. :D
