I sold my AWP | Hyperbeast for all of the Sakura Games. Was it worth it? You can ask that to the 10 empty tissue boxes laying on the floor.

Portal 2 was an awesome comeback from Portal and it still is. One of the best games valve ever released. I give it 9.7 out of 10
I honestly felt that Ghosts' multiplayer was a huge disappointment compared to MW3, and the reason I'm comparing Ghosts with MW3 is because Black Ops 2 is not made by IF. Going to back to the multiplayer topic, this has been one of the rare case scenarios where a Call Of Duty game has a campaign better than the multiplayer. I hereby rate multiplayer 4 out of 10 and the campaign 7 out of 10.
