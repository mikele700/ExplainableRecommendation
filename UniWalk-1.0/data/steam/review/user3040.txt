Facepalm as your teammates run into marked enemies before being outnumbered and killed yourself, followed by a complementary teabagging. 11/10
Now first off I will be clear that I only really bought this game to play while other larger games downloaded onto my rig, however the premise on the store page caught my eye so why not, right?I will start with the fact that the visuals, dialogue, locales and background music fit extremely well together. You are Henry, a man who, once you start playing, will discover has issues he is trying to deal with, how does he deal with them?, by taking a job as a fire lookout in a quiet tower in Shoshone National Park all alone...... except for the voice on the other end of his walkie talkie. Visuals - SolidBackground Audio - Extremely fittingDialogue - Well written and actedPlaytime - 3 Hours with minor rushingThemes - Suprisingly well thought throughTo leave a small note, this is a rather elegant debut game by Campo Santo and while many say the play time doesnt justify the price tag, My opinion is that they have done extremely well creating a game that is both thought provoking and different. I look forward to their next offering in the video game world.Kudos to you, Campo Santo
Gameplay is solid and challenging, movement = time is definitely a fun mechanic. Overall a solid 11/10
Fantastic game with an OST that gives your ears ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.
