So far I have no complaints. It is a really fun exploration game that has lived up to all my expectations. I hope they give a patch to help others with the lag and things they are experiencing but for me I have a pretty decent gaming pc with the GTX 970, and i have zero lag anywhere so far and not one glitch or crash.I especially like the variety of different plants and animals and enjoy learning the different alien langauges so I can understand them more when I get to trade. Kinda sad to hear everyone else is having so much trouble. Hope the issues are solved soon and everyone gets to enjoy the game as much as I currently am. I think the only negative thing i could say is that I would like more ship storage but that can easily be managed by upgrading or trading for another ship so isnt really an issue.
I wasnt expecting to like this game seeing as it had so many bad reviews and i dont even like dota 2 but i was actually quite happy with it.It is more like league of legends than dota which is what woud put some people off straight  away but i liked the games smooth simple combat and i had no lag troubles.The only trouble i had with this game is finding some people to play it with not many people aren't even game to try it i guess because of all the bad reviews but if you got it in that humble bundle play it you never know you might like it as much as i do.7/10
I bought this not expecting to play this for more than like an hour but became addicted to the fighting styles and progressively hardening levels.The only bad thing i could say about it is i found the boss rounds a little easy compared to like the lightsword rounds but that might just be me.Overall i loved this game enough to finish the entire student mode and i would recomend this game to anyone wanting a fast fighting game to test there reaction time and button pressing skills and whatever you do dont be put off by the corning looking stick men.Great Game 10/10
