The latest major update has completely changed the game. It is now a recoil-free console port and the once-good buy system is completely broken. rip BLR
Wing Chun ApocalypseI was going to write a post about sliding zombies who are totally unaware of your presence and missing models for items that exist in the game but instead I'd just like to say thanks for the ability to punch zombies as fast as Bruce Lee.I'm sure this game is an excellent proof of some concept, but that concept cannot be 'good game'.Its kind of a bummer that nearly everything was taken out and the game looks/plays about as well as Day One: Garry's Incident, but at least its on an updated engine and literally 10 times the cost.ps. better FPS on max settings does not an optimization fix make when you remove most of the models, textures, world, and game content.I eagerly await another decade of your not-so-weekly newsletter
Super casual, horrible UI, poor class design, terrible AI, and multiplayer vs players is an abomination.The F2P system is similar to that of Blacklight Retribution, a sort of rent/buy thingy for items and attachments. That's average, and its the least terrible thing about the game. If you hate that, you'll hate everything else more.
mediocre graphics that are poorly optimized - you can enjoy low quality effects with a low framerate to bootit plays like red orchestra or insurgency - everyone hunkers down in one spot and doesn't movethe netcode is so bad, i and someone else both shot and killed each other at the same timethey HAD an fov slider and REMOVED it. this is a pc game, right?janky, terrible TDM game that has lacks potential** also all of the positive reviews are from people who have been playing this game for too long before it launched on steam and are so invested they just dont want to see it die
Its an okay game, but as of this review it has so few people playing it can't actually be experienced as a multiplayer game.
