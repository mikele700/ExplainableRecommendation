+ Quite an interesting game that provides a nice challenge. + Different characters and traits allow for multiple playthroughs. + Visuals, sounds and dialogue are spot on, so you feel like you are really there. Worth the asking price, especially if it's on sale.
At first I didn't enjoy TF2, but after playing a bit more I can see the good points. Although not really my cup of tea the game is free and has an active community. Worth a try at least.
This game is just a massive camp fest. Deleted.
