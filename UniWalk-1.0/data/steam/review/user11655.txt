A Very Short SummaryMetro 2033 is a post-apocalytpic first-person-shooter video-game based on the novel written by Dmity Glukhovsky. The story follows a young man named Artyom as he travels through the dark and dangerous tunnels of the Moscow Metro while fighting for his life against mutants and bandits.Whether it is the darkness of the tight tunnels or the open space of the destroyed surface above, I simply love the atmosphere, I mean, it's similar to every other post-apocalyptic game that I've played, but this one just seems different somehow. Plus, tiny features such as cracks on the gas mask and the heavy breathing of the protagonist makes it even better. In my opinion, the only downside(s) of the video-game is the voice-acting - I'm assuming that they were trying to steer away from the stereotypical Russian accent or it's just me and my knowledge of Russian accents, but let's just ignore that. The frame-rate isn't the best either, there are times when it would dramatically drop then randomly rise again - I don't know about everyone else, but then again, maybe it's just me.All in all, I think it's an excellent game and to conclude this short review, I give it a 4.5/5.
-Ah, Team Fortress 2, why are you so addicting?- is what I say to myself all day - everyday. This excellent game is addicting and                           I                              mean addicting.I-'ve spent over 2000 hours on this game and I have no idea how I feel about that... but enough of random blab.Let-'s begin with... What is TF2? TF2 is a popular multi-player based hat simulator (ha ha, definitely an -original- joke), no story mode, no single player - unless you include practice mode and being on an empty server (which is unlikely depending on your location and the time you-'re on) - the community consists of hat-crazed people, weapon-quality crazed people and Gibus [crazed] wearers.In other words, the community is crazy. Crazy but fun, that is.Don-'t let the cartoony styled graphics drive you away from the game because they are actually quite nice and fit well with its 9 unique classes.So why should you get it, you ask? (Even if you didn-'t)IT-'S FREE TO PLAY! SO WHY NOT? Experience the game for yourself because you don-'t have to pay a single cent and if you highly enjoy the game, then you have the option to buy it and become involved in the crazy community of hat trading.Therefore, sit yourself down, get the game and waste many hours of your life on it - like the majority of us because I am certain that you will enjoy those wasted hours. I sure did. I think. Maybe. I still don-'t know how I feel. Anyhoo, I give a 5/5 for this fun-filled game. (Keep in mind that it can also be rage inducing).
Have the urge to kick some zombie butt? Don-'t wanna be a loner in a zombie-filled world? Well then, Left 4 Dead 2 is the game for you. The concept of the game is pretty basic - join forces with three other players and beat up some zombies with a frying pan, or if you-'re tired of hearing the screams of dying infected - be the infected AND HEAR THE SCREAMS OF THE SURVIVORS INSTEAD. HA HA!Basically, if you get bored of playing as the survivors, the game gives you the option to fight against other players as 8 different special infected ranging from long-tongued Smokers and crying Witches to acidic Spitters and -my vomit brings all the zombies to the yard- Boomers, while some have their advantages and disadvantages, they are still very fun to play (sometimes). All I have to say is that L4D2 is one of my favourite games to play - especially with friends - and I want to emphasise the ESPECIALLY. Don-'t get me wrong, playing with random players is still pretty fun, but can be off-putting if they-'re too good and immediately overpower other players, including me (which happens quite a lot, but hey, what can I say? I-'m no pro at L4D2).Overall, I really enjoy this game and give this zombie-shooter a 5/5!
