While I missed having a choice of male or female protagonist like so many of the other -choices- games, I found this to be one of the most absorbing, with a wonderfully realised story and often quite heartwrenching set of choices , I wouldn-'t hesitate to recommend this story to anyone that enjoys these type of choose your path games.I-'ve played through once so far, which took about 4 hours, unlocking roughly a third of the available points, though I think I avoided some early possible deaths and poor outcomes so it could be a somewhat shorter game for others. I look forward to a few more playthoughs when I have time, and especially look forward to enjoying some of the darker story lines that seem to be possible.
World of Tanks styled space dogfighting game. Use of bots to fill out MP matches ensures short wait times for PvP. Interesting mix of ship sizes and roles. PvE missions offer some variety. I found the UI a little lacking in enemy detection/direction and found it easy to lose enemy ships or locate their incoming direction (though this could be inexperience with the game). No controller support I could find, but a minor gripe, as mouse/keyboard is fine.
Interestingly, I think this is a very effective Rorschach test of a game. Gender is unasigned, and the story allows for a fair amount of interpetation, so I played as a closeted lesbian best friend who didn-'t make a move on her (presumed straight) friend in high school, then went to engineering school, then got drunk and hooked up with her old best friend, ruining that friendship and another budding romance. The ending was especially poignant in this scenario, and unlike the -beta/friendzone- experience others felt, it felt heartbreaking for both characters, rather than being one sided.Great little indy title, that really shows the strength of gaming as an artistic medium through it-'s ability to involve and allow choices in narrative, even when there are relatively few moving pieces.
