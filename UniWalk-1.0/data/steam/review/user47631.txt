Well the game was[/u] good. And then they gone and done messed up with this stupid update, turning the game into a crappy pay 2 win [Pay2Day]. Not only have they made it possible to boost guns if you buy them, they've turned the entire game into an economy, similar to CS:GO and TF2. Not only does this detract from the game it makes the game less about excellent gameplay, team-spirited heists and challenging missions, and more about some skins wish truthfully look quite crap. Ordinarily I would recommend this game to anyone, and I have on several occasions, but now you gone and done messed up. Devs have gotten far too greedy, first with 30 freakin DLC's and now with bloody micro transactions inserted in the game. Not only have the DLC's progressively gotten worse and made the game less about cohesion and more about $$$, we have micro-transactions for greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can get more cash in their pockets. Well you can f*k right off
