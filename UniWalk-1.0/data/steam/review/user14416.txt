This is my first review. So about this game i sum up that it is pretty nice looking with gameplay.(the skill, the character and the robot). Dam i like the A.I robot so much But there are 2 problem with this game:         +first i encounter a case where my team got like 3-5 are newcomer while the other team is full golden 3 bar, the result for this round is pretty much got wrekt by other team, i suggestion developer should add a screamble vote and also absoulutely a votekick(well the game is still on early access but those function is a must-have in a game where balance is not absolutely and afk(away from keyboard) can be found).         + the 2nd problem is the game feel like another.....call of duty,you know instead of going for teamwork, support each others, but most of the time i feel like i just run and shoot people(i know, i know it is still on early access)Others than those 2 problem i found the game is quite nice. I hope dev will continue update on this game and complete it so i can delete this review
the game is fun with your friend. i Bought this one when it come out and start to get boring because noone else can play with. Now it is f2p, with more player, new game mechanics, looking great but the thing is the game is buggy as hell...for some part. Like i try to choose this monster but the game decide for itself and change the monster i want(the same goes with hunter). Another one when player quit or afk an A.I will replace them(the thing is A.I is really dumb last time i check) and when player quit, no player will join the game to replace it. The last one is the most annoying despite the 1st, like when you found some buddy in your match, the round end, the game switch to new game which will force me to leave the game and auto finding new player. TR please fix ( I know it is still on Beta Stage but at least make the game seem to be -playable-),P/s: Please bring back the mode Player vs A.I
