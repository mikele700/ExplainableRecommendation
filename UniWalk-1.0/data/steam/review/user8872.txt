I could never get into Dwarf Fortress because of the interface & because I don't have as much time on my hands as I'd like. Gnomoria has enough content for a filthy casual like me to be able to pick up & tinker with, without squinting at a ton of ASCII screens or fiddling with mods to enhance the graphics.The Gnomoria art style could be considered basic, but I like the look of it and it does the job.Being time-light, I need a game I can pick up & play straight off, and you can do that to a certain extent in Gnomoria but your little kingdom won't last long. It really could do with a tutorial mode, but the game is Early Access, and as the devs are patching and adding content it would probably make a tutorial a bit of a pain to implement. Maybe some popup gameplay tips could be implemented instead?TL;DR - Simplified version of Dwarf Fortress. If you ike the idea of that, take a punt.I give it 4 out of 5 yak skulls.
