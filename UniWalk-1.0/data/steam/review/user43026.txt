a game priced at $7 when it's easily $30 or more fantastic game with around 30 hours of a campaign with great laughs all roundhighly highly recommended
great game but quite short, buy it on a good sale
really fun quick game to play on the side, not worth 15 bucks but buy it on a good sale
just do it in one sitting with a friend
