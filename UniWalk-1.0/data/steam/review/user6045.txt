Counter-Strike: Global OffensiveA great FPS game which keeps on getting bigger evry year. The guns, the sounds and the game modes are impecable, but there is only one problem; hackers. I ran into four of them in one day, but no matter what, I will still keep playing this game, its just that you need to upgrade the anti-cheat. Overall, its a game which is always worth coming back to.Rating: 8.6/10
One of the best FPS games I have ever played.PROS + +No Hackers+A large range of weapons to choose fromCONS- -Nothing!I have heard the USA servers have shut down, but does that mean the Australia servers are shut down? Im reinstalling this on my new PC to find out! If they are shutdown, I'd just like to say this game shall be remembered by all of us FPS fans.
A perfect game that is set in the original Counter-Strike world with many more diffrent weapons, skins and maps! This is one great game!
