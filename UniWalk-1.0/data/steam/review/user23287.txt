This game gave me lizard skin armour and made me feel like snow white with the pretty little birdies. Good game would play again.
This game is redonkulously hard. It's not fun just starting the game with the hill and your friends get shot straight away because they just wanted to charge an be heroes while they crawl to you afterwards wanting to get healed but instead I put them out of thier miseries with my pistol for 2 reasons is that I wanted to be greedy and as for the other it was to just teach them a lesson. I'd rather play cod.
I started on the boat, got out then realised I couldn't live in the marrowind world anymore and drowned myself in the water.
