Through all the times of playing the DayZ mod, the standalone does NOT dissapoint, i'm so happy with how it turned out and you can loot so much!, so many interactive features, and possiblities, more loot areas, more clothes and customisation! so good aye?
Pretty fun game tbh, needs more content, but i haven't played much so i can't exactly talk. maybe spice it up a bit? make it more enticing, and more exciting to gain levels, because getting 1 perk and not actually really noticing a difference when you level up is a bit of a shame, and maybe a better UI interface for items, and being able to actually see items on you, not actually just editing the sprites manually! really fun thought:) i've been enjoying it
