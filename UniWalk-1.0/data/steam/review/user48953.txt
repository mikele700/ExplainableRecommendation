don't waste your time on this. heavily pay to win. the pve is boring and repetitive. the pvp isn't balanced due to overpowered classes as well as dumb game mechanics and a lot of unfixed bugs. it may be fun at first but it eventually becomes very stale. it was a good game a few years ago. it is a terrible game now.
