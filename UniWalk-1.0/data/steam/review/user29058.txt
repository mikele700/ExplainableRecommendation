If anyone played the 'brototype' for Broforce and are wondering whether or not to pay for the steam version... I highly reccommend it! Broforce is all the balling action you did for free with 5x more stuff, theres online, 3 new co-op modes and an improved and expanded campaign.And new Bros!Buy it now, trade stuff for it or sell your family for $15. Do whatever you can to get this game!
