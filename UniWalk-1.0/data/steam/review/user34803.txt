This is a good game for people who like first-person shooters if your lucky then you could even make steam money.there are alot of things to do and my favourite thing to do in CSGO is Casual or Competitive the ranking system can be weird but very complex and well done. there is a large variety of different guns and tons of different skins for those guns but some of the skins are over priced.
