I stumbled upon this game a while ago thinking -hey this looks pretty cool- Maybe I-'ll buy it. I was like wow, there are gun mods, magic, superguns. It looked really good.So I bought it and I have to say it is great roguelike game. Even if I had lost, I wanted to come back and see what new gun combinations I would get and what new guns I would discover! Lots of different enemies to face and hard bosses. A lot of projectiles everywhere from bullets to fire to rainbows! Deathmatch against AI is fun and stil challenging too!This game is still in Early Access so I can-'t wait to see what new things it will bring to this game!
Great Game!I have played through this game twice and enjoyed the multiple ending of the stories. I still need to do the Night Driver run but am enjoying the game very much! Mechazord fights were fun and later on got pretty hard but enjoyed it but getting towards the end it started to get a bit boring pressing buttons. I enjoyed -chromatizing- into rangers and overall a great game. I also enjoyed the main menu soundtrack and think you did a great job on this game. Keep up the good Behold Studios on this game and others too! (also have played Knights of Pen and Paper on my Phone)
