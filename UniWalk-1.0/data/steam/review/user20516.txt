Damn good CO-OP i must say.
This game is so horrible, good thing it was free
Very good game, i love the co-op with my friends and it provides a nice challenge, also i can run it with minimal lag on my crappy laptop so it's good for even crappy computers
This is a fun game with so much to do i could spend hours just thinking of new ways to complete tasks you really have to think outside the box in this game 4 stars sounds about right
