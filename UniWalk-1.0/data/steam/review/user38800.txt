A very entertaining sandbox game, perfect for anyone wanting to mod or create cool things with the Half-Life objects or just ♥♥♥♥ around.However, I highly recommend you get CS:S, TF2 and maybe the two Half-Life 2 Episodes ot get the most out of it, since many servers will use stuff from the above, especially CS:S weapons. Even if you don't, though, it's still very fun to play. Get it nao!
