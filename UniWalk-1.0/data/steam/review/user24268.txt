I liked it alot but the only problem is that there should be more of a backstory saying why you picked this job and how the Machines were made.But overall i give it a 8/10 Just needing more of a back story
well with all dlc this game is awes wait for it ome AWESOME
Awesome game just needs more updates and needs multiplayer for it to be 10/10 but for now i rate it 7/10
This is  the Best Game the the nice people and the awesome builds you can make makes it perfect.There is only one downside the hackers and bullies even though they affect the game if you enjoy them it makes the game 10/10Thanks all the Steam workshop Creators you helped by making it awesomeTotal i give it is 10/10 Keep it up guys
