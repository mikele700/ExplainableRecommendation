dow is one of the best rts  i have played only one real problem with this game is that my cursor seems to be invisable so i cant play good does anyone know how to fix this problem
this review is on 117.5hrs of play timei do love this game for many reason1. many servers have nice players (con of this is some will act nice then stab you in the back)2. i havnt really had a problem with the big tribes (con of this is i really want to go raid big tribes but most people trade together and some even have events for other players to join)3. many servers are awesome. My fav server is arkwarfare due to it only having 2 factions that do raids each weekend (cons  we cant raid certain areas to help make it fair)5. traps traps and traps + birds (cons to this and also a pro to this is to feed the trolls and every game needs trolls)6.guns (cons to this is that many guns are very expensive also there isnt enough dakka)7.DINOS BLOODY DINOS plus other BLOODY CREATURES WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT(cons more then that)8.YOU CAN BUILD ON SOME DINOS AND CREATURES AND SOON YOU CAN BUILD ON A FLYING ONE(cons still not enough)9. A BRONTO WITH TURRETS ON ITS BACK IS THAT ENOUGH (cons a little more)10. RAFTS WITH TURRETS ON THEM (cons not a dino)11. DRAGONS, KING KONGS, GIANT GIANT GIANT GIANT BLOODY SPIDER (cons only tamable in survival of the fittest)12. DODOREX FOR HALLOWEEN (cons NOT ENOUGH OF DODOREX)13. BUGGYS (cons BUGGY IS BUGGY)14.tamable dinos (cons BLOODY PAIN IN DAH BUTT)15.UPDATES SO MANY UPDATES(cons dont expect optimization updates till all dah dinos are added)
i love the gameplay and all that but the problem is that i cant seem to find anyone on this game and the ammount of dlcs (im posting this after 10 min and only found 1 player)
