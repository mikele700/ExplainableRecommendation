Pretty ♥♥♥♥ing Cool. Each class can use every type of weapon, NO WEAPON RESTRICTIONS! Imagine being able to whack people with sticks as a thief. Or using akimbo daggers as a mage. Pretty cool right ? Also, it's not one of those crappy and overused click on an enemy once and watch ur character do the work. NO! It is not like that. There is still some level grinding in the game though, but it isn't that essential. So far it's a 9.5/10 for me.
The Pay2Win level of this game is just........ It can be played casually and without investing any money in it but then you would be at a huge disadvantage due to the fact that you have weapons that barely match theirs.I honestly tried to get to the max level....... But every time they updated the level cap would just increase, and the fact that you  rank up too slowly without the exp multiplier that the Premium players get just forced me to play this game for hours on end.I eventually stopped at rank 100+ The max rank is probably 235+ by now.The game's matchmaking system is purely unbalanced. If you're a bronze threat player....You basically get treated like dirt and get matched up against goldies, and also.... The backup that you get usually doesn't match the power that the opposition has, unless of course you roll with a clan that's filled with 150+ ranked silvers and goldies.But then again, there are some actually decent people that actually have skill in playing this, it's just a bit sad that the community is just......... But still, I would recommend it with friends, and also don't take this game too seriously
