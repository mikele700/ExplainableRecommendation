Hilarious game i could play it forever
Weapon balance is terrible, tripwire need to fix that. It feels like op weapons for demolitionist for example such as the rpg are underpowered and useless. The game is a lot harder then the original killing floor, I think Tripwire need to dile down the difficulty a little bit. I often find that with normal clots they are running at the speed of gorefasts which shouldn't be happening, please fix that tripwire. Not just with the clot but every zed. I like how tripwire made it so you could achive up to level 25 for each perk, it is a great way to make sure the player always is occupied and always has something to do rather then spend a tonne of time completing crazy challenges to level up your perks in the original killing floor. The weapons i feel are too expensive. I often have to wait until wave 4 to actually purchase the weapon that I want because my dosh is going up so slowly and by the time I actually purchase the weapon I want, if I'm playing a short game I'm already at the boss round and didn't get a chance to use it much. Please make the weapons cheaper. I also like how tripwire keeps adding new maps such as black forest and farmhouse, and a new perk gunslinger is very interesting and I would definately recoomend trying it. The return of the patriarch is also a fantastic thing, something killing floor fans will be very excited about. Overall it still incorperates the satisfying killing floor feeling of just simply killing and is a good game however I do feel like these problems I mentioned should be fixed.
This game is literally so much fun!!!! There is soooooo much stuff to do and its great when playing with friends. I could play this game everyday of my life. Can't wait for Killing Floor 2!!!!!!
I wouldn't recommend this game its full of try hards
Love this game so much fun and a lot of stuff to do
