Here is my experience of the game.I start the game up, once I get to the main menu i see select character and head there immediately, fight with the strage controls of the game due to it thinking i have an xbox controller plugged in, once I was done looking at the 4 selectable characters, of which the choice seems to be entirely cosmetic or they just dont tell you what each character does, i looked for the options menu, which i couldnt find. I decided to just join a match, 2 games where running, each playing the LOBBY gamemode, with 1 player each and -1 ping, my game froze for an odd minute or so then when i tried to join one of these games i was greeted by a black screen, five minutes later and still nothing, i closed the game and gave it another shot and nothing changed. and third time is not the charm, tried hosting a game and this time i was left to some lovely art and nothing more.This is not a game that should be purchasable, i personally got it in a humble bundle so I'm not too upset, but this game is just nothing, im sure maybe the combat is fairly redeeming, but the game is t incomplete to let you access the combat, and indie multiplayer only games are always a terrible investment and never relaly a good buy, because there is never anybody palying which will make the game unplayable, literally unplayable
Fantasic variety of characters from reindeer knights to snipers this quick and crazy fighter is unlike any other.Just watch out for the bee boss...
Pros:Fantastic feel and good gunplayRewards skill and accuracyCons:No party system at all, doesn't even put you on the same team as your friends when you join the same game
Such a beautiful game
