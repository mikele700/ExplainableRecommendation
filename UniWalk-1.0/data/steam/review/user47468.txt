this game... this game is beautiful. i cannot express my feelings well enough, to describe what i felt when playing this game.  i laughed, i cried, laughed and cried alot more. the soundtrack was amazing and it made the game a tearjerker. never have i ever felt such a connection to the characters in this story than any other game. 10 out of 10 this is a beautiful game that everyone should play
