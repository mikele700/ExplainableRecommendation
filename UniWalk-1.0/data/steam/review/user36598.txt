This DLC is great! The DeLorean is very detailed, god job Psyonix!But.... one more thing......Shouldn't Psyonix add the wheels in Back to The Future Part 3?The DLC is not really recommended, but if you are a Back to The Future Fan, it's worth it!
11/10 Would play again. Although some people who work at Valve really need to check before buffing or nerfing.*cough* Phlogistinator *cough* but still, it's not pay to win, very balanced game, except for some weapons, ehem, the phlog.
