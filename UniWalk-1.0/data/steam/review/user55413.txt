Starbound is a fantastic game the music, the bosses, NPC and the exploration in the game are just great. I was playing before the colonies update came out it still was a good game that is why i am recommending this game.
I did love the game it was great but the devs raised the min specs you needed to play the game.sorry to say but the game has became a s**t hole of a gameR.I.P SE
