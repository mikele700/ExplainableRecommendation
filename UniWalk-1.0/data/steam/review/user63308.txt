The game has a lot of problems, and I am going to list a few of them. Character facing the wrong side. ( This is probably a bug ) No tutorial. Difficulties playing with keyboard. ( Some of the movements that you may want to learn ( located in WAZA ),   requires a controller to execute but fret not, there is a way to learn all the movements ) If you double tap your d key, it will dash forward. However, tapping excessively may cause it to continuously dash. Occasionally, whenever I am in the menu ( in game menu, not the title screen menu ), my game may go into spasm mode, denying me from saving the game to selecting what I am going to train next.Is there a saving grace for this game? Yes there is, make such amendments to the file, kmslot1 ( not going to go into full detail since there is guide for this ), and max out your stats. However, there is still a low - moderate probability of you getting your ♥♥♥ beat by the AI.
This game reminds me of Final Fantasy XII and Final Fantasy X ( the Final Fantasy franchise that I played ). Also, do not use the DLC Characters particularly Peashy and Plutia, while progressing to chapter 2, if you intend on playing the game as it is meant to be. Otherwise, go ahead. I will not include a pros and cons. Instead I will replace with things you should expect. Overall, if you enjoy watching the anime and manga, chances are, you are going to enjoy the game.Things to expect : Fan Services Moe Some monster models are reused Stupendously Huge Chest VS Flat Chest Farming for Plans ( These plans are basically items, such as weapons, outfits and so on ) Leveling of characters, partner ranks
