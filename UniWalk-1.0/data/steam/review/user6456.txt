The creations are ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic 10/10 would make a ♥♥♥♥ again.
I really enjoy this game, It's super fun! My fave weapon is probably the smartlocks. The only thing bad for me is, with the new update I can't play it at all, it just comes up with an error message.
Yeah pretty fun I guess.
I legitimately don't understand why people think this game is so good. I'll see you in hell for posting this.
Was pretty P2W but atleast they stopped shoving the option to buy stuff in your face.
