Sick game but not optimised fully yet. Lookign forward to more updates.
This is one of those must play games. If you like Mass Effect 2's graphic style and colour scheme, you'll like this, and even if you like Mass Effect 1/2 in general you'll most likely enjoy this. It's super fun playing stealth. Plus, you can stab civilians on the street with your arm blades! What more could you want?
Great game. Gravity gun for the win.
If you are interested in WWII, and want realism then this is definitely the game for you. I suck at it though.
