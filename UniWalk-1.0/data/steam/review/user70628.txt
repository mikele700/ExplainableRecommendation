Portal is a fun but challenging game with loads of levels.The game has quite good graphics and is a awesome sci-fi strategy game.Even though portal 2 is out already, portal 1 is just as fun and exciting.The game is based on a person who is a test subject in a gigantic lab with robots and the portal gun which creates portals.This game is only single player but still fun.I do recommend this game for all sci-fi strategy lovers.
