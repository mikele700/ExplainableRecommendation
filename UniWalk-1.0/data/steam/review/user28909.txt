I've owned this game for less than two days and have played 10 hours already, on my first playthrough it took me an hour, on my second playthrough it took me 9 minutes, and after that i spent 8 - 9 hours just messing around in the side missions and trying to speed run the main one. I do not regret buying this game at all, in fact it is probably my favourite game this year, I own my fair share of games on steam, over 200, yet it is very rare that one of these games will be played for more than 2 - 3 hours, what i'm trying to say is that i have definitely spent more money on less gameplay, if you are sure that this is the kind of game you enjoy, BUY IT NOW, it is well worth it, i'm not even half way through all the content, if you dislike stealth games, i would proceed with caution, there isn't much story here, though for sale price i'd say its worth the leap of faith as it's controls are stellar, especially compared to previous metal gears, the controls are fluid, the graphics are incredible, the port is nearly perfect, yet the content will last you anywhere between 5 minutes to 50 hours. In conclusion i'd give this game an 8.5/10 objectively speaking, but personally i'd go as far as a 9.5, this is exactly what i wanted and i knew what i was getting walking in, which is a short yet solid stealth game with tons of replayability.tl;drMETAL GEAR FANS - NO BRAINERSTEALTH FANS - GREATNON STEALTH FANS - KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTOI RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE
one of the most stylish, incredible and fun spectacle fighters i've ever laid my eyes on, from the soundtrack to the gameplay to even the dialogue (in a campy, fun way) this game is flawless, one of my favourite games of all time as a matter of fact, for anyone who likes slicing up cyborgs to heavy rock music this is a no brainer, and to anyone who enjoys action games in general, please give this a try, for its current sale price of $6 it is amazing and for the full price of $30 it is just as good. 10/10
incredible optimisation for a game that looks this good, ran incredibly on medium on my laptop which has a quad core amd processor at 1.5ghz and 8gb of ram, so any reasonable computer should be able to run this game at a playable framerate. the story is amazing and hooks you right from the start, as well as having an unintrusive AI partner that can be incredibly useful at times and is very interesting as a character. The respawn system restarts you in a safe area close to the fighting and keeps the enemies you have already killed dead and gives some health back to those you haven't, this is both good and bad as it stopped me from getting frustrated but also kept the difficulty reasonably low. The gunplay in this game isn't all that good but it is bearable and very much functional, you'll find most combat is in the way of your progression in the story as opposed to fun which can be annoying at times but 60% of the time you can run right past the enemies and into the next area. This game may seem like a first person shooter but the shooting is definitely not it's strong point, this game is a first person story driven adventure and it is incredibly fun and interesting, it runs beautifully and looks incredible while doing so. story: 9.5/10gameplay: 8/10difficulty: 7.5/10 (although a harder mode is unlockable)design: 9/10graphics/art style: 9.5/10optimisation: 9/10overall: 9/10great game, must buy (although if you are looking for a long experience, this one is completeable in 8 - 14 hours depending on how much you explore. i personally prefer games that aren't 20 hours long)
