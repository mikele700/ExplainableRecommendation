It takes ages to get on a server and the maps are ment for the same team to win every time and is very annoying. So overall it takes a long time to even get on the server and then its just boring and frustrating
It is an amazing game that gets a little bit repetitive.7/10
I never knew i needed this until now. This just made my day
A fun arcade style game that is best played with friends10/10
Amazing songs and even better gameplay, this is the reason i love games.
It's Duke at his finest!
Waited so long to get this and just recently bought it. Let me say it is definitely worth your money.
The music alone is reason enough to play it, but yhe real fun is murdering your patients in horrible ways!
Somehow managing to be fun and boring, this is an amazing, story based game.
A game that is boring and over expensive. 2/10
