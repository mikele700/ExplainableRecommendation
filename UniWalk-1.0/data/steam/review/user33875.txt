I honestly never knew that a goat could explode a car, sending it flying into someones house landing on a treadmill and sending if flying back outside into a fence. This game also serves as an educational purpose too. 10/10
As good as the dark decent? It has a different feel but a great story, full of must see events that will give you the hunger to play more. The dark decent and A machine for pigs are both great in it's horror ways, but A machine for pigs is a must play for scares, story and experience.
This is what gaming has come too. Cleaning blood, picking up rubbish and disposing body parts. This game tried something different and actually did a fantastic job in my opinion. Worth getting but not to try out but to have an enjoyable space station janitor experience.
A game that will show you the true meaning of horror up close.
