Pros:Vibrant modding community (before a few days ago)Cons:Base game is terribleHave to pay for mods
With over a thousand hours, and most of the DLCs, I would have wholeheartedly recommended this game to anyone.However with the release of Crimefest 2015, Overkill now has broken all modding, and added paid weapon skins that improve your weapon-'s stats. I cannot in good conscience recommend such a game.Hell, even the -Overkill Approved- Hoxhud mod has been disabled.
