I absolutely love it! All my favorite Superheroes in a MOBA game! AND IT HAS SOME COMEDY IN IT! LIKE EVERY COMICBOOK HERO GAME SHOULD!!!BUT...If you live in australia this game is nearly unplayable due to extremely high latency from the servers being soooo far away!If the makers of this game release an Asian, or even better an Ocianic server i can see myself playing hours and hours of this game and even throwing some of my money for useless things like costumes... :) So due to the aweful server locations i cannot reccomend this game to anyone in the Ocianic part of Earth. Chuck us a server then you'll get all the recommendations!!!!
(9/10)Really enjoyable platformer game with my favorite voice actor, voicing the main character! It also has a great sound track. Unfortunatly no one seems plays online multiplayer so unless you have friends with this game, you cant play some of it.
Great game, if you have time for it...
one word,AMAZING
this is a great strategy game would recomend it to anyone
THIS GAME IS AWSOME ANY TRUE PIE FOLLOWER WOULD SEE THAT
