This game killed my social life and the mods hauled it to the granite crematorium.
I's freaking rad and the ingame graphics are wonderful. Not great latency for Aussie players though, even on the closest servers.
Simple, endlessly replayable, catchy music, this has all the hallmarks of a classic.A few bugs, but it's frequently updated so they're quickly caught.9/10 stars.
