Don't get me wrong, this game is really nice and for the price I recommend that you pick it up ONLY if u like an atmospheric walking Sim (in a good way) the game is beautiful design wise, I love the pixel art graphics and the story is genuinely quite interesting however the game is bland, boring and lacks depth in gameplay. The puzzles are ridiculously simple and you find yourself having to backtrack way too much, I mostly found myself walking around aimlessly, I feel as though if there was more objective it would have made a better game. I don't really fancy horror experiences too much however this game does it nicely and if you like horror and walking simulators pick this up however for me it felt as though it lacked things and could have been more.Basically the game looks nice and the story is quite good but it is boring, tedious and repetitive.
If this game is less than a dollar perhaps its worth 20 minutes of your time but for the price is just a bunch of nothing, The sounds are generic the combat is tedious and I spent my entire time running across the top empty on ammo and mindlessly collecting items to sell.Aesthetically, the game looks like it could have been an awesome 8-bit zombie game but it falls short of what it could have been.Basically it looks nice but the gameplay is boring and tedious and not worth a great amount of time, not even the local co-op was fun.
This is a game done right.Everything from pricing to gameplay is just stunning. The whole idea of this game was to make it feel like an arcade machine (remember those) and the developers have nailed that. The price tag is perfect and the game itslef feels finihed and polished.Overall this game is absoloutly worth it and a must play for arcade machine gamers.10/10
This Game is Glorious, Fantastic, Perfect, Badass and I need to say no more.Just Go Buy this game, its marvelous and its worth every cent.
Hammerwatch is an insanely fun hack and slash RPG adventure that is both extremly challenging but fair, set in a fantasy retro style pixel art environment. Play by yourself or grab a couple friends in this epic dungeon crawler that has a particular retro feel to it.If you miss the days of good old gauntlet on the NES then you will love this game.I highly recommend this game to anyone who has a couple hours to kill with some friends in an epic hack and slash adventure/8/10 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
Gunman Clive is an absolout brilliant gameIt took me back to the days of old style platformersIm gonna be honest alot of swear words were said and I did rage quite 2 times but apart from that, this game is marvelous and fantastic.I loved the western themed soundtrack and the artsyle of the game was beatiful (emphasis on beatiful)Overall I give this game 8/10 and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good old Fashion challenging platformer, such as MegamanThe only downside of this game is that is doesnt have controller support and I hope to see it added In the future maybe.
