♥♥♥♥ing amazing, second time i bought this game, both for pc and xbox 360 !!!
Drift Streets Japan is not the best car game i have played in a long shot. Yes its the only game like this on steam, and yes the drift physics are decent. But the game isn't perfect. Sure you many say for $6 its pretty cheap, and it is. But is it worth buying?To answer that in short : Yes, i think it is. I bought the game when it first came out, and back then lets be honest the game was missing ALOT, but after a week or so after release, the game has been updated quite a few times, always adding new and improved things. Such as manual transmission, more cars, a better interior, and much more. Yes, of course it could use alot of work, with the many bugs, and being able to use a controller, but if you look past that, and see that is has a chance to become something great, it makes you wonder why you shouldn't buy it. I do have high hopes for this game, as it has already come so far, and i do believe the dev's have some idea as to what they want to add.In short, i think Drift Streets Japan is great game to pick up. Yes, it has bugs and glitches, but what game doesn't? and what game on steam allows to buy drift like this game does? NOTHING.Hense why i recommend this game.
Worst damn game ive played.
I used to love this game, but they ♥♥♥♥ed us up, because they reset my level, stats and even took away all my inventory items that i spent money on.
