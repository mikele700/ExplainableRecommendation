Short Answer: Amazing Factory Game. GO get it!Description/ Long answer thingyProbably one of the coolest games I have ever played, It just drops you in and you can either figure things out yourself by playing in a -Freeplay- mode. Or you can learn the game at your own pace in the campaign. The game is a resource managment game (Like the game Minecraft, although in this one you make automated factories) You collect resources then you build up to make it all automated. It will get more and more confusing the more you build up and expand your automated factory. In the freeplay mode your goal is to get a -Rocket Silo- and go back to outerspace. (You-'re a robot that fell into a world from outer space, and the world is filled with native biters that attack you as your factory grows) If I were to rate this game I would rate it 10/10 because this game is simply amazing. If you have $20 go and get this game! Or wait for a sale if you dont think the price is right.  So. Go get this game, you will love it. BE WARNED! It is very addicting. VERY. ADDICTING.
Very EPIC game! So many planets, and places to go ^_^. you guys did a GOOD job!
Side note thing: I think this game has a really good idea. I think the game itself is amazing too. I have no idea why people hate this. Every problem they said they had has never happened to me. I do think $20 for this game might be a little too much though. I think it would do better if it was atleast maybe $10-$15? I wont stop supporting these devs (No matter how much hate they get) UNLESS, this game utterly fails. Then id have no reason to support this game if it utterly fails.Anyway.Castle Story is a Resource Management,Survivalish game. You build castles and protect your castle along with a crystal that can summon warriors, archers, and workers. There are 2 different modes right now (Sandbox, and Survival) There is also a tutorial you can take too. Which I would reccomend. Pros: +Great idea         +Characters move just fine for me         +Nice musicCons: -A bit buggy with building (It is Early Access)         -Devs are a bit slow (but I dont mind)                                                                                     Thats all I have to say for now, This is all my opinion.
Just...call the ambulance for me already dangit...my life..its sucked in forever untill ambulance come......help.
