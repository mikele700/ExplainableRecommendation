This game is downright amazing, I loved it when I got it 2 years ago and still love it to this day, it's an example of what most RPG's should be made of and have to make it a great and fun game. For example, the exploration in this game is spectacular and makes you wandering for a while and always finding something new to do but the soundtracks and DLC's is what makes it awesome, the DLC's I'd recommend ALOT! As they are filled with great content to keep you playing and interested as well as new shouts and such. Yeah, sure this game can get buggy and crashy but face it, it's a Bethesda game and it's supposed to be that way for such a big open-world game like this. Soundtracks were beautiful and animations and graphics are slendid, gameplay was enjoyable and exciting especially if you mix between playstyles, the stories and factions are quite cool too. So yeah, 10/10 for me.Definately recommend.
