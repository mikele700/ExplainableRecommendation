Life is Strange is an utterly beautiful game and it's only the first episode out of five! I may have made some choices I didn't like, but hey just roll back the clock and try the other option. By the end I was very confident with the choices I made and can't wait to see how those take affect in episode 2 :) Honestly I have never looked more forward to playing a game then this one. This is a game to remember. DONTNOD Entertainment, you've won me over. Big time.
