i'll start by saying that iv'e played many a puzzle game and am a self-titled veteran of the point and click genre. This game is an excellent example of the two, with a very nicely executed yet simple formula present in its levels; screw around with enviroment, find items via the affore mentioned screw around with the enviroment, combine items/ screw around with items, play short often skipable mini-game, rinse and repeate (the interface can feel a tad clunky). but the graphics do let it down, i felt like i was playing a game with an ENB preset made by a blind, semi-brain dead, jelly fish. but worse than the grapghics was the voice acting, it felt like somebody had kidnapped a random guy off the street, handed him a script, then pointed a loaded shotgun at his balls. but aside from its mostly ignorable flaws, it is a very good game worth devoting a few minutes and a few dollars
really good for relaxing and being creative
