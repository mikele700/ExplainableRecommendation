Well all i really have to say about this game as a beginning base player is that it works.  I have never picked up a guitar in my life, but the bass has always interested me, so i bought the game, bought the cord, and bought a nice Ibanz SDGR Four String.  The first few seconds of the game was me learning a tutorial on how to pluck strings, and now im playing Knights Of Cydonia nearly perfectly, and i only have 10 hours logged into the game.  Rock on Rocksmith.11/10, seriously. Buy the game you butt.
Ever since this game was announced, i was psyched to see what it could offer.  The trailer came out and i swear i had an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ due to the amazing looking graphics and the elephant riding thing made me go batshit crazy for the game.  When the game came out i had already preordered the game and bought the season pass.  The game was amazing and the story was fluent and interesting.  The graphics were as they were in the trailer, completely ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.  If anybody has $60 then i highly reccomend that you buy this amazing ♥♥♥♥ing game.
