Okay so I'm a noob at Don't Starve in general, but here goes my first impressions:Day 1 Attempt 1: Woke up on a small island with few resources. Saw some crabs walking around on the beach and decided to build a few traps. I caught a crab and was about to light a fire to cook it when I realized I'd depleted all my grass on making the traps and died alone and cold in the dark.Day 1 Attempt 2: I spawned a similarly small island this time, and was a bit more prepared. I gathered all the wood and grass on the island and went down to the beach. This time I set aside some grass for the fire, and dropped it on the ground and went about hunting crabs. While I was hunting it got real windy, and I noticed my grass blowing swiftly across the bay away from me. I gave chase but it reached the water before I could catch up. I died alone and cold in the dark again.Day 1 Attempt 3: I'm not screwing it up this time! I had a fire going by dark and enough food for a few days. This was gonna be easy...Day 5 Attempt 3: I've made further than I thought possible. I've set up a base in a beach biome, got all the tools and even have a small boat with a sail. This is awesome! I also rather cunningly used a pitchfork to take some swamp biome to my own base and grow swamp trees for an unlimited supply of wood! Eat that Bear Grylls...Day 9 Attempt 3: I feel so great at this point. I killed some spiders and built a net to catch some fireflies! Now I have a lantern on my boat! My swamp trees have fully grown has well and my wood harvesting has begun. On the second tree a yellow snake dropped out and bit me once. I died a slow toxic death.F**K THIS F**KING PIECE OF S**T10/10 Would die in every way except starving again.
Me and about 4 friends decided to buy CS:GO when it was on sale. After 30 hours of competative matchmaking, only one of them hasn't blocked me. 10/10 would throw match again.
