You spawn in total darkness, look around to find some type of light to go to, you hear a click behind your head, and turn around slowly, a bunch of guys welcoming you into this world with a loud gunshot, as you realise you are not hit you look to the group while the one with the gun points behind you, you turn around and a walker that was about to have you for lunch is now lunch for the ground.THANKS GUYS!
