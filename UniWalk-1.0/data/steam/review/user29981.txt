In my first 64 hours of Besiege I have had a metric wood ton of fun:DIts a great game if you like janky physics and beautifully hilarious glitches if you know what I mean.  And by that I mean 39 cannons on one block I mean well its kinda an airplane but is super laggy and glitchy. Its some top level stuff:DI think yall should pick this up:D
