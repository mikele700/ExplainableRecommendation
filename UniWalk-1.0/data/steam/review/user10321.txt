Playing this game, esp in 3v3 or 4v4, you will quickly discover that the true war is where team is (team and opponents all treat you like the ball).10/10 would play bumper cars again
This is essentially Hitler having a go at remaking TF2 into his own style with dinosaurs
Game in a nutshell: Where was that chest/cage again?
Perhaps it could be improved by adding a fast forward button so you don't have to see the horrible cube spawn animation all the time and see if you actually did the puzzle correctly. Probably half the time you spend playing this game is watching the cubes do their thing than actually solving puzzles. 1/3. For those people curious on how i have 0/0 hrs is cuz i returned it
