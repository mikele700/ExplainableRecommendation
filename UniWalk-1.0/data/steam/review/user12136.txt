Same old, same old, but still had me hooked. If a game keeps you interested for over 50+ hours, it has  done what you payed money for. The singleplayer is not that notable, run and gun simple minded plot, but the multiplayer is where it excels. A good variety of guns and other customisation features to keep it varied. Sadly it is still P2P multiplayer, which means lag and hackers. Zombies is amazing, if the game goes on sale, buy it just for zombies. It it absoultly fantasic. A wave based survival mode, shooting zombies, upgrading weapons, interesting maps, power ups and easter eggs are what makes this game great. There are the normal COD problems, no learning guns, pick up and play with ease and simple map design are some of the problems but they are outweighed by good things that make this game worth buying. If you are a COD pro or noob, it is a staple COD to own.
Good, fun game in the BioShock series. I feel, however, it does not live up to the franchise name, the story is not innovative at all; find the girl, shoot bad guys, win. The gameplay is very repetitive and the story feels like it is purposely dragged out for too long. Visuals are very nice indeed, but the story was not interesting at all. Only buy the game if you want a short -gallery shooter-, with a mildly interesting plot and boring characters. Sadly I cannot recommed this game, I want too, but when a singleplayer game cannot form an interesting plot, it falls at its core and everything else falls with it.
