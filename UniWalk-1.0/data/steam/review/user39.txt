a fun game that gets ridiculously hard on harder difficulties, suits any music you choose to play or just the in game music.ive played most of my hours in this game when my net drops out (hence the hours) and have been playing since it was in beta. not sold on the daily challenge but the new station is an interesting consept. overall... love the game, 8.5/10, would reccomend to fast thinkers.
