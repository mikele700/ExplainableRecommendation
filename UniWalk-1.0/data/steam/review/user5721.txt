♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥-A guy whos mad about his base getting raided by my squad.Unturned has grown over the past years and im proud that its grown so much.It has become one of my favourite games and made me quit TF2(horrible update).You dont need a beast PC to run this game.It runs fine on a potato.The community is nice and thats very rare.Well,you're gonna get screamed by a bunch of kids with full military gear.Some are nice,some are just complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.I really do recommend this game.Nelson listens to the community and brings daily updates.And its a F2P game guys.What else do you want?
KAMIKAZE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Great game.Outstanding graphics.10/10
