Once you get past the first time account setup and the 15+ minutes of waiting to enter the server for the first time Trove prooves to be a unique game both in gameplay and in the art style. The colourful 3D pixel graphics add a very bright and inviting nature to the world and the extremely easy to understand tutorial makes playing Trove for the first time very enjoyable, not to mention a community which is one of the most inviting I have ever experienced. If you can get past the waiting times to enter the game Trove proves to be a very enjoyable experience being both relaxing and challenging at the same time. Also definitely not pay to win/be OP with the best comparison to the game store being Tera.Edit: at this point in time the queues are crazy, yesterday it was a 25 minute wait and today it was 36 minutes, I'll be coming back once they get better servers. Still a good game though, highly recommend for final year students as you will get a lot of study done during wait times.
The Magic Circle is one of those games that takes you completely by surprise with the sheer amount of time and effort that has been put in to a comparatively short game. At first glace The Magic Circle looks simple and lighthearted but as you delve deeper you find a complex and emotional game where every time you replay it you find new things and new ways to solve the puzzles you are presented with. I would highly recommend this game and it is completely worth the price even if you just play it once. 10/10
This is quite possibly the most fun game I have ever played!! From the briliant taunts to the thousands of weapon combinations this game will keep you occupied for hours on end.
