Sir, You Are Being Hunted is a very -pretty- game, with a mix of thrill, horror and humour. Best of all it-'s really cheap for a game of its type, so if you have a few spare bucks, definatly buy this game, it wont let you down.
Too much graphics.
All i can say is DEFINATLY RECOMMEND now let me get back to beating this giant frog up with my mortar.
