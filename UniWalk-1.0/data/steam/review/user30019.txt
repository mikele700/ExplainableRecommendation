This guys starting magic power is a... i have no idea what you call them but there is a large one at the black smith, (on the map) ok (you can go there by the map) well you have a smaller one that you spawn in for 2 or 3 seconds and it hits the mosters/guys in frount of you with its tongue and ita ♥♥♥ can hit people behind you (if they're close).
