Marvel may have domination over netflix and moviesbut ♥♥♥♥ me the day they make a good game
Dark Souls, an infamous game of death and learning. I sure havent finished it, but I really enjoy it, the death dosent feel like a punishment but a learning expirence. Dark Souls is harsh, unforgiving and deeply rewarding, even after several rage quits, yelling and screaming. Dark souls has given me an expirence ill never forget.
Intrested where this game will go, loved the first episode, go buy it, before someone ruins it for you
this game is pretty gey
Fallout 3 in my opinion was better than skyrim, there was something that was present in the Fallout universe, survival, and thats what makes Fallout 4, better than Fallout 3 and Skyrim. Its progression, its characters, its weapons, almost everything about it makes it a worthwile game, buy this game, you'll get countless hours of fun and a great expirence
crash central
great fun to be had, really great idea...could buff the monster at stage one, I find the monster dies to quickly in some matchesfind a alpha code or pre-order for this great gem.
