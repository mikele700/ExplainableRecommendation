Brawlhalla is a great free to play fightig game. All characters can be unlocked through playing the game and although some maps and characters are unbalanced, the majority of them are fine. I enjoy this in both matchmaking and with friends.I think that when it is polished and is finally released, it will be an amazing game.Would KO by throwing horn again.
