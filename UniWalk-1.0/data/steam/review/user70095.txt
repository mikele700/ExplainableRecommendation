8/10 Overall a good game, thought there should be more additions for weapons, items and abilities. Verily this stands out among those crappy -F2P games- that turns out to be -P2W games-. I love on how crisp the graphic is even thought this seems to be a rather cartoon-ish game, also the community so far (except few bandits out there, especially those with Timberwolves) is a satisfactory.Keep up the work, Nel!
Team Fortress 2 is absolutely addicting and accuracy-craving game. Cartoon-ish graphic + OP handling = Good game.
Great game indeed.
Of all eroges, this is the best waifu simulator, and it isn't even an eroge!
Obliviously obvious positive remark.9/11 would crash planes on gm_bigcity
10/10 Probably the best, if not, the most perfect games on its kind since 1999. Though the community is still the same, with you know, those constant swearing and yelling when one found out that their teammates cant even play competitives, of course alongside other FPS community members which is not a new stuff we-'d encounter.For the noobs out there (including myself as well) though, beware, as i-'ve write here, you all should learn how to shoot and aim properly in Deathmatches and Casual matches, before going on and honing your skills in Competitive. If one simply does not learn, then prepare for the -clutches-. Also look out for chickens.Damn someone should remake the -cs_rio- map for CS:GO.
