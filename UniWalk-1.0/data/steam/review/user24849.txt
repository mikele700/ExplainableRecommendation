this game is not really worth getting until it has more content and smoother gameplay. 6/10
8 minutes is all you need
10/10 Great game its set in ww1 whitch is a change from all of the ww2 games. in this one you need to really use trenchs and cover to move up to take objectives or defend them. well worth the money
an amazing game with such a big variety. you will never be bored playing this if you ever are witch i doubt just download a few addons and your game will feel like new again 10/10
