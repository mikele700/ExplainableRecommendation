This game somehow rivals DayZ to the point where most of the features are smoother and work far greater than the game its based on. I really enjoy the building mechanics and I definitely enjoy the gun play especially the peeking. Multiuplayer is awesome even though I have played far more singleplayer. I recommend this game to anyone, its a real gem and like I said it rivals games like DayZ.
I don't understand how I even play the game. The music nearly gave me epilepsy and the community only spam crap in chat. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!
