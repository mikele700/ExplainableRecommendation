firstly, reading recomendations or not you should download this game because it is only 500mb! and free!the multiplayer is definetely something that needs fixing but thats no problem since they are fixing and updating this game constantly. i absolutely love games like this because there is two sides- wanting creativity or wanting a fight with either zombie or human, an adult that loves blood or a kid that cant play bloody games. i love how you can change the rating on this by turning off blood, so anybody is welcome to play. over all- amazing!
