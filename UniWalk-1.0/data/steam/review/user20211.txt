A masterpiece. I have no idea how they packed such replayability into a linear, story based game but Sega did, and gave us THE best platformer ever.
A perfect celebration of all things Sonic- my only criticism is how little control is afforded by the character's crazy acceleration relative to Adventure 2.
Play Sk.Get visited by Escort first night.Escort writes your name in will.Get lynched.Great few minutes, would be escorted again.
This is the Toast Game that came before I am Bread.Gameplay was inarguably fantastic, the graphics were nice and retro, though the music got pretty annoying and the resolution was mobile resolution. All in all, buy if you want to play it 2-3 times and ignore it after, that's what I did.
This game is great.Bold statement, I know but this game is literally better than Skyrim, as it is far more focused whereas Skyrim is general-purpose Fantasy Simulator. Oh, and you can possess people. Can't do that in Skyrim now, can you?
The BEST simulator ever. Nowhere else can you shove prisoners into tiny cramped spaces, take everything they own, feed them food WORSE than gruel and then spray them with a firehose when they try to burn the prison down!Rate 11/10
Completed in 17 mins... so short LOL
Urinating on fires to stop explosions has never been so fun! In this retro-styled point and click game, your objective is to stop something from exploding within a twenty second time limit by kicking, punching, breaking, drinking and peeing! Overall, a very funny game that was impossible to put down until I'd finished it.5 / 5 STARS
Doing this to get a badge.Still a good game though.
