so Good!!
great game!!one of the best first person tower defense i have played
One of the greatest games I have found which is free to play yet still keeps the modern advanced war fighter in keen site. This game is fast paced and hectic, well worth your time to play.

Battlefield 2 is not the best modern shooter out there but it has most if not all of the basic stuff that you need for a game like this. I find that the game is good but compared to other games around the same time period its ok but all in all it is a good game!
