This is a relatively short game.  I finished it (earned all hidden achievements, though they aren-'t hard to obtain) in less than 10 hours.  That said, this game is beatiful.  The artwork isn-'t realistic, but the devs aren-'t aiming for that.  The characters are given an animated, -cartoon-y- sort of appearance, and that fits great with the rest of the environment.  The music is perfect for the game as well.  Be warned: it-'s not a survival game, and it-'s not an open-world game.  You are given a very limited number of choices to make, which all ultimately seem to lead to the same ending (trying to avoid spoilers here).  But I did -buy in- to this game 100% with immersion and atmosphere.  I bought it on sale, but in retrospect, would have happily paid $20 for it.  
If you-'re into civilization-building (note the lack of a -Sid Meier- or capital C in that phrase) game where you-'re essentially given a few families and a handful of resources and expected to make them thrive, then this game is for you.  This isn-'t an AoE-type game, or even a Civilization-type game, insofar as there are no competing factions who will attack you.  This is simply a population-focused survival game, and it-'s a pretty good one at that.  I-'m addicted.
