After the recent patch RoboCraft has become quite similar to a MOBA. Now while some of the community has disliked this I feel this will help it in the long run. The new gameplay mode does take longer. However, it does provide new opportunities for interesting gameplay. As well as becoming longer the devs have added a shield around the base that heals you and goes down after the opponents have control over all the newly added towers.These new game mechanics have really added to the strategy of the game. No longer will your opponents rush at you, trying to take your base early. Instead, they will try to take towers as you fend them off and try to take towers of your own.One of my favorite moments in this game was when I was the last surviving member of my team and the enemy was attacking my base. Using the new shield to my advantage I (and a large amount of drifting and strafing) I was able to destroy the attackers and with the overclocking I had gained led a successful charge on the enemy base after we had taken all the towers.Overall the game is very fun and I would recommend picking it up.
