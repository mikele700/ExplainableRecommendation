OMFG I <3 THIS GAME I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERY1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
super fun just wish i could make mods without running into problems, but thats just me and my modding failure other then that grab a torch and an axe and prepare for a good time with friends cause this is a really fun game and i recommend playing even if your a loner with no friends cause you can make friends and not starve on a random server so...yeah
step 1. grab friendsstep 2. start a game and invite your friendsstep 3. laugh at the chaosget this game and play with friends its worth the money
THIS IS ABSOLUTLY BULL! my game keeps on going black screen after i click to start just to go to the menu! unless theres a fix im not changing this review
i didnt think this would be as scary as it was. its not as bad as amnesia if you r new to it but this actually will make you jump and is entertaining to play so i recomend that for those looking for a jump
you couldnt ask for a better free to play game there are so many users playin everyday and youll just wanna play all day
