When i first played Half Life, i was amazed at the graphical power (at the time) and sometimes would spend like 5 minutes looking at a random zambie that i killed, this game IS MAKING ME DO IT AGAIN!!! WOOP! (love you devs for remaking one of my most fav games of all time :D)
Wow, just wow. if you are gonna get this game, watch a LP of it.you may just like it.
It-'s very....Civ V, of course when Civ V was first released it was rubbish, then DLCs were released and it got AWESOME!.now that Civ Beyond Earth has it-'s first major DLC, it-'s gotten ALOT BETTER.Conclusion: It-'s a good game, just remember that no game when it first comes out is -all that-.
All im gonna say is this...Gods and Kings is to Civilization V as Rising Tide is to Civilization Beyond Earth, exactly what the game needs (still a but pricey tho, i would wait for a sale before you get it)
This game, oh this game. Somehow the devs have made a game MORE feature complete in EARLY ACCESS, then many full games. I LOVE IT!
Have you played Pandemic 2? Well if you have, then you will know EXACTLY how fun this game is.You have to infect the WHOLE world and like Pandemic 2 it can be very difficult at first, but as you get into the game then it gets VERY fun watching whole countries fall to a little bug.Overall VERY FUN.
Uber has Good Intentions, with very Poor Execution.
Love the new DLC. AWESOME characters and new rings! Well done Devs!
Uber has Good Intentions, with very Poor Execution. also TITANS!!!1!
Cars + Explosions + Lotsa DAKKA (WH reference right there) = AWESOMENESS GALORE!
