DOTA 2 a fairly recent moba from what I have been told.Pros:Good graphics Good serversFun Gameplayhandful of good people to play withgreat heroes and great play style.cons:Terrible community rages at you when you die once and when they die once they blame lag.Overpowered heroes that valve refuses to nerf but instead buffs up these characters.Tutorial terrible.All up this game is fun to play and i will continue to play it and i give it 4/5 stars.
Team Fortress 2 is a good free to play game and it is also a different sort of first person shooter with blood,guts and gore.If i wereto rate tf2 out of 10 i would  rate it 8.5/10
