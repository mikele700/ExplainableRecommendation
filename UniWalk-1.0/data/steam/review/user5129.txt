An interesting FPS game with loads of weapons that differ from the old cs:s. Highly recommended.
Well, I really enjoy this game. Honestly, I cannot understand why I uninstalled it, BUT, I think it is an EXCELLENT game for any of you CALL OF DOOTZ fans, I should know. I played CoD alot, then I played this and I was amazed. Then again, not many people are fans of valve and CoD. It's understandable but my personal rating is...Well...20/10 ^-^ Brilliant game. Absolutely brilliant.
Gmod is an amazing game, and I highly recommend it to anyone who can afford it. My most favourite gamemode on it is trouble in terrorist town, but your favourite is up to you.
