MOTHER EFFIN SPACE NINJAS WITH MAGIC
Arreseted a murderer. Denied a crossdresser.Helped out the Arstozkan's equivilant to the illuminati.Accepted $10 bribes.Shut down a human-trafficking ring.And told Jorji to get a proper passport FOR THE 4TH FREAKING TEAM.All in days work for a border-checkpoint inspector.GLORY TO ARSTOZKA.
In the first 30 minutes I threw a giant mech, jumped on missles, and cut a giant robot in half with a sword.Yeah.Fun gameplay, stupid story, kickass soundtrack and all-round-badassery *No previous knowledge of other -Metal Gear Titles- required to understand the story of this game
