Great game, cars, rockets, and a ball, what could go wrong?
One of the best deathmatch games of all time!
THE best racing game
This is a great game and I love the minimalistic and modern style. But, the game is very short (I completed it in seven hours of gameplay).
On the surface this game seems quite simple, though it has a lot of playability. I have had loads of fun with this game and it still continues to grow, highly recommended.
Fabulous game, excellent port, well worth the wait.
