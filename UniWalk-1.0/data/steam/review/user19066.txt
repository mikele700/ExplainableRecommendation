Enjoying this a bit, still in alpha but a fun magic fps.Reminds me of a sort of Quake mixed with Magic, cant wait to see the full product. :)
Great game, really enjoying it.Good to play solo or even with friends.
Really enjoy this game. Have had loads of fun.Struggling recently to find people to play with, but the community has been great.
A game you can play on your laptop and even have parts you can do on your mobile such as crafting which is cool.Easy to jump in and play solo for a bit level up or two and then log out easilyEasy to play - just follow the pixie dust - although its good to take it off so you can just explore on your own. The only bad point I have come across at the moment is with the companions and horse as without grinding for hours and hours on end they only other way I can think of to upgrade them is to pay - even though I already paid at the start and found out after all my money had gone. - Note though if you buy a companion you dont need to pay to level them past 20
Great to help learn the rules from scratch, and runs alot smoother than Planeswalkers.Plus I am liking the story as well.Well done guys, great improvement over past ones.
I like it, for the fact I can choose PVE, PVP or even just head out and cruise.Took me awhile to work out which Faction I liked, but its all good.I recommend to give it a go
