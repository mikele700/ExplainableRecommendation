with a decent tutorial and a huge learning curve dota 2 is an amazing game from stacking camps to teamfighting there is all of these complex elements to dota. All of the heros have their strenghts and weaknesses this only works because you have access to every single hero in the game from the original package. Since this game is free to play you should expect some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t free to play model but no this is a very good one all you have to pay for is cosmetics and tickets for pro games even though the stuff is a bit overpriced considering this could've been a $100 game i accept this. dota 2 is a game you could sink 1000 hours into it and still have more to do i give it my personal 10/10. if you whine about the community there is nothing valve can do about that unfortunately hence i didn't talk about it much getting a stack of 5 going is the ideal way to play this game.
