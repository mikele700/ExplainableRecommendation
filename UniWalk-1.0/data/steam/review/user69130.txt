Even now this game is still one of the best RPG's of all time. If you liked Mass Effect or Dragon Age then you'll love this. Graphics are kind of dated and it lacks voice acting, but the combat system is stilll extremely fun and the story and characters are high quality and remain interesting to this day. Defnitely the best Star Wars game of all time. If you're on the fence about buying it, I strongly reccomend you take the risk and get it.
