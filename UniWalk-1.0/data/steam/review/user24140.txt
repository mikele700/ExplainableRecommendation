A fun game. Garry's Mod contains alot of content and can be extremely fun if you understand how to use everything. Noobs will often find this game extremely hard but can probably be helped by youtube. You've got a lot of gamemodes such as Trouble in Terrorist town, a game mode consisting of a couple of traitors and a lot of innocents. The traitors shall work as a team to kill the detectives and innocents. The innocents however do not know who the traitors are meaning that they could be killing anyone. Then you've got Stop It Slender, a game in which several player's set out to find a bunch of pages. They need to collect these pages before the Slender Man kills them. Sandbox, Sandbox is well Sandbox. Pretty much just go around and build awesome structures. As In everyday life and in everyday gaming you should always be expecting a loser to scam or trick you. Well that's the review, I might have said some bad things in this game but this game is definantly worth buying. $10.00 for a game that allows you to do well, everything? Yep depa dy dep!  7.5/10
