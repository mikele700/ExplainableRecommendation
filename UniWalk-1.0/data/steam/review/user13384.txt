This game was one of my genuine favourites, and it still would be if people still played it. There was a peak when you could get a full server within a few seconds, now you will be lucky to get a game at all, I mean REALLY lucky, I envy you! If only this game got more attention. Still I get on now and then and play organised games with friends but it would be great if the community got back together.
Episode 1's cliffhanger made me buy all 5. ♥♥♥♥ing perfect!PERFECT!PERFECT!PERFECT!PERFECT!PERFECT!PERFECT!PERFECT!PERFECT!WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!!! ^_^
This game is absolutely amazing, I wish I paid the full price for it because I feel I ripped off the developers when I paid $0.02 for a sturdy, quality, AMAZING, spectacular game. They should ask for more money too and how do I ride the horses? I can't beleive that I've finally found a game as beautiful as this; I bought it for all of my friends and they love it so much too. I bought it for my crush and now I have seven girlfriends. Like wow, why didn't I buy this sooner. Xoxo, much love from Hobbet360
90% of people today cannot pass the first level of the original Mario game withough dying at least once, if you are of the 10% of people who can, this game is for you. There is quite a massive learning curve to this game, but once you realise how your muscles work it all comes together! You punch with your pecs and you bend with your abs... :DEDIT: ♥♥♥♥'s intense!
