Zombie Army Trilogy is a major upgrade when dealing with the zombie onslaughts, with a matrix-styled slow motion, you can really get a deep satisfaction from a headshot. Granted the visuals are outstanding and I can not wait until my friends join me seeing that while enjoying a game solo is made so much better when it is a shared experience. The game gives you a wide variety of weapons to use against the zombies and of course like in shaun of the dead you can melee by kicking the snot of them.  It would be great if the score was displayed so that bragging rights to the most kills would be easily shown but in my experience playing the campaign so far upon death is when you see how many you kill. You may be surprised at how bloodthirsty you get whilst playing this game!What are waiting for? Get this game and hunt some zombies
