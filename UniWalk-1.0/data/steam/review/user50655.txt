Planetside has a lot of problems, but there's one thing that it does better than anything else - warfare on a massive scale. In no other game can you expect to play with and against hundreds of players. In battlefield, the biggest size you can get is 32v32, a size which is exceeded on a daily basis on every server. If you want to see what it's like when you cram 150 people into an area less than 100m x 100m, you might as well download it. It's only 10gb. The worst thing that can happen is you don't like it. I've got 2 pieces of advice for you if you do decide to play:1. Join an outfit, even if it's some ♥♥♥♥ tier zergfit. You'll learn how to play more easily if you've got a group to follow. Post on /r/planetside if you want some advice as to outfits2. Look up wrel on youtube. He has a bunch of vids that are really useful to new players. You'll learn a lot of the secrets to the game off people like him. You will get farmed at first, but half the fun is the learning curve
