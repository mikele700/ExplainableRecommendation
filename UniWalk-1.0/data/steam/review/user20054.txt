I would be -Flat Out- trying to think of a good thing to say about this game. ;)If you want a racing game that is pretty ♥♥♥♥ with horrible 90s inspired -punk- music, then get this one, I definately got my $1.25 worth of entertainment from this.
Hey wow this game is really fun and the art style is really growing on me! You guys should totally buy it if you don't have it already!!!
This game is ball bustingly hard, but in a good way.
This game is horrible. I'm only wasting my time writing this so you don't waste your time playing it.
It's just damn good.
It does what it says on the tin, you shoot zombies. Sometimes they shoot back.Probably worth 50 cents, I've played better flash games. Get ready to get stuck on ♥♥♥♥ and reset just when your about to beat the last boss, WACKY!!!At least the horrible english on the CONGRATULATION! screen is funny.
This game feels like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ job simulator 2014, you are looking after a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ children for 9 hours and the only reason you keep turning up is because you feel obligated to finish.
