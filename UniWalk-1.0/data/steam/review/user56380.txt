♥ ♥ ♥ Overall ♥ ♥ ♥Fairly good game to play with friends using the Join feature, very envolving gameplay when you try to level up and complete dungeons to aquire more loot, appart from the long queues I definitely recommend it.☺☺☺ Pros ☺☺☺-> Private open world exploration with friends in Clubs feature.-> 11 Classes.-> Item rewards in Dungeons & Lairs equilibrated with death penalty.☹ ☹ ☹ Cons ☹ ☹ ☹-> In this version usually 30+ Minute queue.-> Low character customization ( Just face ).
