This contains everything i could ever ask for in a Choose your own adventure game.Simply: I love it.The story is original and it never lacks for excitement. I would recommend this game.
It only took me a few minutes to see what Door Kickers is really capable of, the top-down Tactical shooter developed by Killzone Games really got me quite excited as soon as i saw it. With alot of the Tactic games i play, this one takes the cake.The controls are simple, easy-to-use, and quite addictive, i definitely recommend.
This game was truly astonishing, never have I seen a game that i'd adore more than this.The graphics are great. The gameplay is great. The Lore is Great, and the Developers are great.The only thing I dislike about this game was how short it was. Let's hope we get a sequel.
The graphical aspect of this game may be slightly outdated, but if you can get past that, i'd highly recommend the Survivalists.
The Game is amazing, i don't know where to start.It's engaging, Original, and i can play it for Hours on-end.10/10 Would definitely recommend, but It's a shame Shark-Punch isn't well known.
Great mechanics and story, the deviation from the Zombies and Military genre really adds a new aspect of originality.I am happy to see a developer putting effort into their work,and it's inspiring to note that Wolfire had created this game in Seven Days!10/10 - Iz gud
