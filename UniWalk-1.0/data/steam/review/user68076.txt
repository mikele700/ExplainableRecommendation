This game is a very good starter to play if you want to get into the Tom Clancy's series. My friends and I downloaded this to give it a try, and all that I can say is that I was very impressed for a free shooter game. 8/10 would recommend.
This game gave me an educational insight into the average everyday life of a normal goat. I feel that the developers really nailed the realism and life-likeness. 10/10
I recieved Nuclear Throne in a Humble Monthly bundle, and it is by far the game that has recieved the most playtime from the bundle. Nuclear Throne is a Rogue-lite twin stick shooter with an interesting progression system within your runs. Your selected mutant will be able to accumulate different mutations after each stage if you have collected enough radiation drops from enemies. There is a large variety of guns which I doubt I've done more than merely scratch the surface of. The core gameplay loop is very enjoyable and I will continue to put hours into this gem. I do however have a few gripes with the video choices within the game. The framerate is capped at 30. I have heard that this is a problem with gamemaker studio, not necassarily the devs though. Apparently when you create a project you have to explicitly choose a framerate for it to run at and later on requires a tonne of work to change. Perhaps the blame may lie with the devs on that one but frankly it's not a big issue for me becuase of the existing graphical quality of the game and it's not in first person. Also the game is played in a 4:3 window within a 16:9 interface. I think this is an odd design choice but hey- It hasn't affected the gameplay for me. I would also love a story mode for this game, it doesn't have to be 30 hour campign or anything but I think it would enhance the experience for me. I will ot however hold this against the devs.Overall - 9/10I would highly recommend this game to any of my friends and the few video oddities are overseeable. You are getting great value in this game.
