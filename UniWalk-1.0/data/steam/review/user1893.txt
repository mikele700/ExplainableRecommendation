-this is how you died- WOW, thanks game for destroying my self confidence AND making me ♥♥♥♥ my self...11/10 Would make a sandwich again
Just get napoleonic. You shoot people and miss a lot, and versus' friends, you either dominate or get dominated... And then kill your friends in reality. Ahh yes, MnB. Totally not flawed melee, totally not flawed ranged.
Unplayable For Australians. You Teleport Everywhere And When You Do Get So Lucky To Get A Kill Good Luck Going Anywhere else with the camera zoomed in WAY to close. I Hate ThirdPersonShooters Anyway but COME ON. At least have the camera aat a distance so you can see what your shooting or see what your slashing. maybe the player is half way transparent while shooting. until then NOPE  NO BUY!
