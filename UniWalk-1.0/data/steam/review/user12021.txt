I have played dayz for over 1000 hours and i have had heaps of cool times and there are downsides that are annoiying but when you buy the game you accept that the game is in alpha and is going to be for a while but the game has got alot of content and there is a huge map to explore and there are glitches but i think this game has alot of potential and will be a big success when its finished so give it a chance.
Awesome game amazing graphics not the best story line but good fun and challenging
I have played through the game of firewatch and it is definately a game that is worth playing it is a awesome story you never want to stop until its finished and it is beautiful to play and it does deserve some of what people are saying like how the ending is bad and rushed but i think that as a whole it is an expirience that everyone needs to play
