Half Life 2 is still a fantastic game. The gameplay, the graphics, the voice acting, the physics engine. All these things combine to give you a thrilling experience; you need this in your steam library.
10/10 would become a toilet again.
Hat Simulator 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016.In seriousness though, Team Fortress 2 is a fantastic FPS. Everything is balanced, there are many classes and weapons to choose from and the game is an absolute blast. Don't forget the hat collecting too though.
An under-the-radar game. Alien Swarm is a F2P co-op top down shooter and guess what? There are ZERO micro-transactions and it's also made using the Source engine so it runs really well. You can play with 4 classes but there are 8 characters all with different stats. There are plenty of difficulty options and that gives the game quite some replayability, you can turn friendly fire on, you can increase the number of aliens and there are plenty more options. You should definitely give this game a try with 3 other friends.
Hotline Miami is truly an indie gem. The gameplay is fun and frantic, the soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard, and the story? Well... Thats a whole other subject.
