 What I Like + Hand Drawn Graphics are unique + Voice Acting and Sound Effects+ Makes Snake fun again+ Gameplay+ Missions+ Jokes are good  What I Don't Like - Jokes can get repetitive- The game is really short- The is no resolution customization  Final Score  NotGTAV is a good game but it has some issues that need to resloved  BUT  you should probably buy this game because all profits made goes to charity
