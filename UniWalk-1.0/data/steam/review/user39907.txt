Just no. Not fun to play as a shooter and lacking as a moba.
DONT GET THIS GAME UNLESS IT GOES F2P.The game says it has a fair business model, that its grinding experience is easier. Early on you get 250 coins per challenge but you soon realise that this is only temporary. You will realise that green decks stomp pub matches and their costs to play the cards are utter BS in comparison to the others. You pay 25$ for early access and then on top of that if you want all the cards in the current game you have to ay an extra 50$. Very Dissapointing, Don't get sucked in with this games trailer etc.
deeeep
