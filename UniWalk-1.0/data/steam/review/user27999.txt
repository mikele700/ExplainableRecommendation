i will eventually hang myself from this game
Awesome game. i had the game on disc before i got it on steam and i played at least 300 hours and that should of told you that i love the game and with mods just makes it a lot more awesome
now i know what it's like to be close with nature
I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE THIS BECAUSE I CANT STOP
awesome game my favorite aspect to the game is the music all of 'em are good. lots of DLC's are cool too but the only bad thing is there is a lot of updates which is bad for me cause my internet isn't that good so it takes a while but other then that its a amazing game and you should buy it ok mate?
couldn't continue eyes bled too much, funny music though...
epic you should buy it
needs an update
kkk ♥♥♥♥
this game changed my life... forever...
