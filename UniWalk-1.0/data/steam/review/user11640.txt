Game/Social experience is amazing and the VR works so well and i've been looking at this game for a while and im so happy it came to steam, now my only problem is that there isn't a toggle mouse button so it looks like you'll have to hold down right mouse button to look around :P, but aside from that it works extremely well and I would highly recomend the game (even tho it's free)
Walking down a beach and seeing a light house, walking up to it and looking up to see the massive scale of this light house, scale, thats what makes this game so enjoyable is the scale as i found this rock pool and i look up and see the georgeous blue sky with these rocks around it just looks so dam good. Now beware this is a walking sim but that doesnt make it bad as when I get home I like to relax so it's nice to come home to a plesant view and yes I am using VR but it isn't the HTC VIVE or the Oculus Rift, insted it is my SAMSUNG Galaxy S7 and the Viewmaster VR (Getting SAMSUNG Gear VR) I am also using an app call trinus VR. Now I can hapily say that this game is great to calm down and it's only 0.99c so you know sell a CSGO Skin or a Steam card to get this game.
Enjoyable and very fun multiplayer game and +1 for the humor, gotta love Claptrap
Lovin the music
It's a really cool and fun game, the price may be high but for someone looking for a fun and big open world game its would be a good reccomendation for me
