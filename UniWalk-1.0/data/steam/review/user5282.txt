Terrible experience with -Games for Windows Live-.
...
Not as fun as it could be. The weapon switch delay is frustrating, even if it is -fair-. Weapon feel is off, hitboxes seem wrong.The way tooltips open partially offscreen. The grappling hooks are enticing, but crippled. Some of the boss fights are stiff, frustrating, grindy. The difficulty curve is too steep in places. Tech progression is scarce.
Definitely worth investing some learning & practice time.
Good, stress-free fun. It-'s nice to play a game so kinetic, rather than -who-'s got the biggest numbers-. Just needs an elastic grappling gun.
Great fun! Turn the mouse sensitivity way up.
Love the non-euclidean geometry!
