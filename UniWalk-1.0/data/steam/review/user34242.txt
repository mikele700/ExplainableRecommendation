Dirty Bomb is a fast paced, competitive fps shooter that is balanced and is definitely NOT a tf2 clone. Apparently people say that this game scans your whole computer and stuff like that but I don't actually care. The game fun (even though my team lost 10 times in a row). This game has currency but it doesn't force you to buy it.Pros:+ FREE+ fun+ balanced (kinda) gameplay+ not pay to win+ good graphicsCons:- grinding, grinding, grinding....- not much content- phantoms everywhere- it takes days for me to update the game (80-100 mb/s internet speed + 1gb update = bad)- my laptop can't handle it well (RUNS SLOW FOR ME)Suggestion:= how about a singleplayer training mode or something (besides the tutorial)= how about instead of loadout cards, use weapon cards and perk cards instead. Having a customizable loadout would be nice.
Oh look! The game has 1000 rooms now! Finally!SPOILERS!!!*plays room 800-899* WHAT THE F*** IS THAT?!! AN OLD MAN? is he gone? *comes out of hiding place* NO HE'S NOT!!!!

In this game, I can do things I can't do in real life.In this game, I can do a back-flip that can decapitate my enemy's headI can rip off the limbs of my enemiesI can deliver a kick that will break your leg into twoI can grab my opponent with my legs and punch his head offI can even breakdance with only my hands and feet touching the groundbut there is one thing I can never do in this game.never EVER...make me walk for more than two steps.10/10 would flop over again
Hats, Conga Lines, Baloonicorns, and explosions. What else do you want?10/10
