Very fun game to play with friends as long as you have a good connection. the game is still in development so I understand it has a few bugs but they make the game even more funny sometimes. I would definitly recomend this game to people who enjoy laughing
this is one of the best open world dino games around in my opinion. the graphics are amazing, its great on multiplayer andtheirs no limit to what you want to do and this is only the first versions. you all should get this game and take it for a spin.
this game can be a fail, but it can be rediculiosly fun sometimes
