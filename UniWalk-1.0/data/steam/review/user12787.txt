Payday 2 logic::Always brings a broken drill to mission, especially the world-'s largest bank.:spots a guard while being stealthy - yells -♥♥♥♥!- outloud.:Drills a safe for 3 minutes only to find useless piece of paper.:Who puts medals and certificates in secure safes?:Kills one civillian, pays $48,000 - kills thousands of cops who are just doing their job, -Nice one-:Attachments can cause more than guns.:Able to carry high grade armor, a lightmachine gun and big saw at the same time - can only carry 1 keycard.:takes a bullet to the head -Im fine.- - Gets kicked by guy -Im down!-:Kills hundreds of cops - Stays in jail for 4 minutes then released with weapons and gear and mask:Can only use gun when mask is on.Overall 10/10 for sensible logic.
In a game where anyone can report you for killing em.Where all reports say your a hacker, RDM-er (even if they were the traitor) or just say you're a noob for killing em.10/10Will be reported again for no reason no h8
Would be the worst game if it werent for my W key and Mouse 1 Button.3/Half Life 3
Perfect game for Perfectionists.People expect you to get kills, MVP and clutch rounds.People and friends always comment on your screw-ups even if these screw-ups almost happen every match.People will kick, neglect, diss you if you are always at the bottom of the leaderboards.People will pressure, destroy your personality and will deny your existance.10/10 Bring me back to COD pls.
