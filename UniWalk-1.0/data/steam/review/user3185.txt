I really enjoyed this gamebut, I rage quited due to the difficulty.Edited 4 years later where I thought -You know what, I-'ll give this game another ago, I had some good fun with it before I quit- So I reinstalled the game, launched it and excitedly waited to play. But wait, Uplay was being an irritable, useless cuntmunch piece of software that refused to work, meaning the game was not unplayable, but unaccesable. YOU LITERALLY CAN-'T MAKE IT TO LAUNCHING THE GAME UPLAY IS THAT SHITHOUSE. LIKE REALLY, I MEAN THE GAME ISN-'T BROKEN, THE LAUNCHER IS AND THAT IS JUST ♥♥♥♥ING DEPRESSING. But yeah, ♥♥♥♥ Uplay amirite?
