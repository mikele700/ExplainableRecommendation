THE HYPE TRAIN HAS ARRIVED.Welcome to DayZ,This is by far my favourite game above all others. It is so unique, and no game matches it on its scale, and sheer survival element. (Maybe rust comes close)BUY IT!
The worlds most Realistic Miltarian shooter is back.ArmA 3 is the pinnacle of Military simulation, and fun in my opinion too. There are so many fun gamemodes on Multiplayer, with many dedicated servers to be found. The Singleplayer shows the full potential of the game, with scenarios which allow people to make their own missions and share them on steam workshop, and also the fantastic campaign called -Survival-.ArmA 3 is a great game for casual and serious gamers.
Great survival element, and great base building. Not too much like DayZ.
