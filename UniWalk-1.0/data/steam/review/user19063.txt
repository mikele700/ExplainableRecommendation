Plain and Simple:  Money Vacumm with Enough Bugs to start a career in Entomology.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'm used to F2P MMO's that have Payment options but not to this level.You pay for majority of the Items within this game; Some of the Dragons, or simple clothing items that provoke your interest towards the game are Member Exclusives or to expensive for the tiny amount of Gems the game gives you. If you make a mistake within your character you have to pay to delete it, Items that have appeal are Slapped down on a price that a F2P cannot get.I played it twice and met advertisements around every corner, Even in the shop, needed to buy supplies to expand within the game such as Bait or Seeds for your farms, The gameplay is just something you Must experience to believe it, -Crash Sim 2014: Dragon Edition.- Oh I almost forgot, You have to be a member To name your character or Dragon, Else you Become VIKING_346IJ2418, Same with the Dragons.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                              I liked the movies, I read the books, I played the game, I left in a hurry, Never again.
A perfect reminder that behind every hero with a boomstick, there's someone close behind crying inside at the amount of gore on the roof for them to reach with a flimsy Mop.10/10  would clean again
