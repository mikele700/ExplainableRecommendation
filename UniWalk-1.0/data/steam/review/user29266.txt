This game taught me Russian for the low, low price of my pride and self-esteem.If Your one for De_stroying People with the click of the right mouse button, Then this is one hell of a game for you. Time to pull out some next level strats.P.S - Do yourself a favour, and don't get stuck in the 'trench'. The 'Trench' being a place of unspeakable horrors, and weekly man-on-man oil wrestling competitions.
