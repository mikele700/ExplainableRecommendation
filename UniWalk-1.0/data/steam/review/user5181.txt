Beautiful visuals, gripping story, breath-taking soundtrack. Supergiant games does not disappoint with this stunning science fiction role-playing work of art. If you liked Bastion, Transistor should be your next purchase. Worth every cent.
Playing this game with Drunken was the single most painful experience in my life
Thighs so good.
Ante up, people. Let's see that lunch money.
Underbelly is good game!!!!!
Really great game, it-'s a more in-depth version of Trouble in Terrorist Town. Focuses alot more around mind-games and deception rather than -kill and hide the body-.The role selection thing is dumb, doesn-'t give me enough time to think of a stupid name.Is good tho
Response Hit:Planetary Aggression is a terrible game but you know what it's not vomit-inducing so I guess it's okay
i learnt that if you don't dodgeroll you're throwing the gamealso the game is good
This game is actually really cute and fun to play. I could've gone out for pizza but instead I played this game for 4 hours.I'm jealous of Shoji and his stupidly good hips. Screw you, Shoji. You're hot. d:3c
thank you for australian servers
