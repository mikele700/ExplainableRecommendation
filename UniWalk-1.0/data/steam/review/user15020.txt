10/10 quality game, an emotional rollercoaster that kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I laughed, I cried, I learned 42 new ways to season and cook a pork shoulder. Truly a new standard has been set that all future games will be held in comparison to.
Brilliant Game, as good as it looks. I have played for 40 hours and there are still features I haven't used, this game is A+++
42/6.2 - Well, its a Goat. Simulator, so yeah thats it
