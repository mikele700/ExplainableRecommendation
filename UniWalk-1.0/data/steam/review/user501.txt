Never made a review before so this probably won't be very good, but here goes...Fault Milestone is, at the moment, the best story I have ever read. From the visual masterworks to the beatifully composed audio, the deep character developement to a plot that constantly delivers a fantasticly complelling story. Every little thing is conected in a way that creates an atmosphere of a perfect story.I can't wait for the next chapter!
