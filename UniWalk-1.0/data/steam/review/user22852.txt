I don't get whats with people here, this is a good game, Microtransactions?, what about it you don't have to buy any drills or safes, you can get safes for free with a drill on some achievements so I dont have a problem there, its true that skins have an effect on the gun but still are you really gonna say no to an extra buff?So what if Overkill lied through their teeth about having no Microtransactions in Payday 2, thats just one lie, I mean look at other developers who lied -_-.If your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about Payday 2 having microtransactions, dont buy any of it or don't use the skins, its not gonna kill you is it?Overall I still think this is a good game, if you don't agree with me then I don't care.
Dis Game is Awsome best i've played recently.
