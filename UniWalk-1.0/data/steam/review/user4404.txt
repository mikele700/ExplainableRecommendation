I used to love this game, I really did.It was fresh and interesting but then DLC after DLC came out slowly making the previous content obsolete and the DLC isn-'t exactly cheap either. OVERKILL said at the very start -We-'ve made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!)-  Guess what?! On the 15/10/15 microtransactions have been added to the game... Skins for guns with stats tied to them to make it even more pay to win in a PvE game!? Absolutely ludicrous. They-'re milking the game for as much cash as they can and it-'s really disappointing. I hate to say it but I regret supporting this game with all the DLC I-'ve bought.
