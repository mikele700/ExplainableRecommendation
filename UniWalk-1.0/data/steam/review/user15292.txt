The game I have played most in my life,2fort never gets old.
Fun, but tough.

Snes Zelda style exploration  with Final Fantasy style combat,pleasing aesthetics, controls are adequate.  Analogue  movement would be appreciated... Second impression after further playtime This is actually a lot more playable and fun than I thought it would be.
Works really well online :)buy it.
STOMP!  STOMP!  STOMP!
Fun and free  :)
