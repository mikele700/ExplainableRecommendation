The immersive, open world is great, quests are awesome and the weapons have really good designs. there is so much to do in Skyrim that you could spend hundreds of hours just doing quests and not learning any of the skills, exploring, or maxing your character out. great game in general, although the combat mechanics could be better (its mainly just slash and hack away).
good, apart from the fact that all players want to screw you over and take your stuff. so if your gonna survive, play with a freind or else you have 0 chance
bad at first but quite good after you start to understand
AWESOME
