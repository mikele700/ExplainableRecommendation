♥♥♥♥ING BROKEN* SINCE NEW UPDATE....
If you were a fan of this game, and joined the community in the closed Alpha/Beta, and bought into it... Well Nexon just ♥♥♥♥ed you over.. The free gp that you were suppose to get on ''open beta'' release..., Haha think again... Introduction the the case system... If you got to lvl 10+ on the rank system.. Well the cases they introduced into the open beta and the gp that you obtain upon ranking up, you don't get..... Well, looks like ill still be playing Combat Arms this year..
Gave me a ♥♥♥♥ing Virus - ♥♥♥♥ you Glyph,
This game is RUBBISHFirst launch game, servers are down... Fine with that. (Week Later)Second launch, Character creation failed - Due to bug (Week later)Third launch crashes.....Fourth launch - Oh wait there wasn't, (Uninstalled) My opinion Def's not worth $20....
