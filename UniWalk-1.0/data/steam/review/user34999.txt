This was my favourite game.Then suddenly, microtransactions. MICROTRANSACTIONS!!!!THE DEVS EVEN SAID THEY WOULDN'T ADD MICROTRANSACTIONS.
After 15 minutes of playing I felt my brain oozing out of my ears. You should get it! It's cheap, and you (probably) won't forget it!
I tried to enjoy this game, I really did.I'm usually a fan of chaotic games like this, and I really enjoyed those moments.However.Where this game lacks, is it's platforming. The bosses, the swarms of enemies, the bullets everywhere, I can handle.But the PLATFORMINGOh jeez. I can't ♥♥♥♥ing cope with it. It might just be me, but I couldn't STAND it. The movement mechanics dont work well enough for the platforming expectations it proposes. I died more as a result of losing most of my health trying to jump across a platform while dodging thousands of enemies than from the bosses or the enemies themselves. The amount of times I've done the full triple jump thingy and either flown straight towards an enemy, gone a centimetre in the wrong direction, or spazzed out in the air whilst getting beaten on by a boss, I thought I was going to tear out my hair. It just became too frustrating.That being said, it's a decent game and I recommend getting it. It's not very expensive and worth trying. I'm just generally bad at platforming.(I highly recommend using a controller, that's the only way I could finish the game)
