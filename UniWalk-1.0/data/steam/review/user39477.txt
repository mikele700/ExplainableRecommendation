* I have not once ever felt bored with this game. * The gameplay is perfect. * This is a game design work of art.* It's a game that makes you think both metophorically and laterally.* You will be amazed how much they fit in such a small space.* The puzzle aspect comes from both solving the puzzles and finding the puzzles.
This game is absolutely beautiful.It's also one of those times where turning the sound off is an actual crime.
