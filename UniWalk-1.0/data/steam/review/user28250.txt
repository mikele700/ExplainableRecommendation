The graphic requirement is quiet high....my poor Geforce GTX 560 is spinning its life away....No matter! I just bought a GTX 980 just for the sake of this game, if this graphics card cant handle it, I'll just smash my computer.
Stop whinging you bunch of primary school kids. Its 16 bucks game which was converted from PS3, what are you all complaining about? You want the best experience, go get a console. I'm just glad that I get to save 500 bucks not get getting a consle and get to FF on PC. So yea, u are paying a fraction you morons.
