i must say this is a great game, the storyline, the enemies, the weapons....just overall epicif you dont already have this game, you should buy it now, or when the steam summer sale is on.i stopped playing this because i got up to a specific part where i was like 'f*** it im not playing this'i got back to it and I LITERALLY WAS LIKE 'HOLY SH** THIS IS AMAZING'when your in combat, its pretty fun, Mutants around every corner, trying to swing deadly attacks at you while you shoot them with an AK-47, then you run out of ammo, but then you dont panic, because you have a shotgun that blasts their faces off in one shotshooting humans is a bit less scary, you just have to watch out you dont get seen, otherwise your in deep sh**i should probibly rap up this reviewyou should totally get this game, its worth 60 bucks
IF U LIKE COUNTER STRIKE SOURCE OR TF2, U SHOULD GET THIS GAME!!NOW!!!!!!
