it sucks.
best game eversalty little nostalgia cultists can visit the trash-can any time~
A walking simulator about how making walking simulators makes you look like a nutjob and also that there's no such thing as valid validation.
Oh, its funny... you'll laugh...That won't last though.
This game is certainly worth the asking price of one dollar.Interesting concept that I'd have love to have seen taken further, I was suprised just how difficult and inefficient guns are to use and operate in real high stress situations... Would love to see something like a horror game with the same mechanics.
