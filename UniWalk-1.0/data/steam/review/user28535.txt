Excellent game. Beautiful scenery and engine. Amazing survival aspects. I absolutely love this game but the only factors holding me back from marrying it is the amount of bugs/glitches and inactivity after you have donet he usual build your house, hunt for food etc. Im sure players would like to see more objectives or actions introduced to the game, but this is reasonable considering this is only the 3rd alpha patch. None the less, beautiful game.
Best game I've ever played. Endless gameplay.
