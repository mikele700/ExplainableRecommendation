Hands down the best RTS game. Thousands of hours wasted in my youth setting up precision attacks with air, land and sea units. Not to mention creating defensive bases that no AI could ever breach, even when you had ten players on a 64x64 map all allied against you.What C&C and Starcraft failed to deliver, TA has covered.About time this came to Steam.
Fantastic game, great concept, easy to play and fun to build robots to battle with.
Good WW2 flight sim. Graphics are dated and in need of update.Good game for those who are interested in flight sims.
The best ARMA to date. Does need more weapons and vehicles.
Was a great concept, pre DayZ.But pay to win, no way.
Great Time Waster. Awesome if you can grab it cheap, (sub $5) and allows a lot of replayability.Not short of bugs, but still fun.
Fantastic FPS. Good pace, not to fast like COD but still requires teamwork to succeed.Great for any WW2 or shooter fan.
