Great horror game, can get a little repetitive so a new fresh set of maps is ideal.The level up system is trash, i've never been so confused between 2 addons, offerings, and perk system.Major downfall is the match-making system, you can be thrown against a level 39 killer with 3 of the 4 survivors a level 1.
I bought Shadow of Mordar (SoM) as pre-release trailers reminded me of my favorite game of all time, SkyrimThe game started out promising, the story (ofcourse), plot, initial cut scene and background, this later was dissolved by what seemed to be a frustrating gameplay of mouse-bashing. I can almost guarantee, my wireless mouse battery had taken a major hit since SoM. The re spawn rate of the Uruks and their captains is phenomenal.There was a city which i literally cleared out, only to witness before I exited 50% of the Uruks have resurfaced, on the way out of the city, more seem to be re-spawning and heading towards the city. There is no break, no relief, it-'s constant mouse-bashing with hardly any skill requirement. I understand we-'re in Mordar, but the gameplay was just stupid as you just spent the entire play mouse bashing Uruks.Mouse Movement was another failure, im not sure how this panned out on Consoles, but you can increase your sensitivity to 10000 and still get areas of movement where you need a 10ft mouse pad to cater, while other movement seemed to confirm the (hypothetical) 10000 sensor settingVarious -Power ups- were useless, one was that you can viciously stab an Uruk with a dagger causing the fleet to flee in terror. I attempted this in various scenarios only the group took one step back, then proceeded to attack as normal.This game had great potential, but also had many flaws which basically dragged it into the abyss of the avid gamer, 6/10 for me.
great game
