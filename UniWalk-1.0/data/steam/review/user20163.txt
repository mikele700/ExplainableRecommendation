Look at this manntastic game. it's a mann's game, for men. So stop playing your baby games and mann up!!! Get a hat! Grow a Mustache! Make weapons! cap a point! Get rich! and stop idle-ing!!! Now go. Trip over a milestone.
The best part of this game is when there are so many projectiless that you cant see the ground. EMBRACE THE CHAOS!!!
I'm not sure how most people play, but when i do, i grow an extra set of eyes, gain telekinesses, shift into maximum overload and start checking 50 things a second, highlighting disrepancies like there's no tomorow, checking all the pages of the rule book twice just incase I missed something important, then BOOM! TERRORIST! My job has stopped for today, my feet are freezing, my family's starving, and my son is sick. I don't know whether or not your final form works for you, but when you have a family with no food, you can either choose to work harder, by the book and for the glory of artstotska, or help criminals and and mysterious groups to earn some extra cash, but your choices will effect the people around you. Will you let your family die and fall behind, or will you stand strong and work hard for your family, freinds and beliefs. Life is tough out there, but are you tougher?
This game is an allround tactical action filled sandbox game, and could be more of a great game if more people joined in the fun and help this young app become a great game. get this now, and GO FLY SOME CHICKENS!!!
