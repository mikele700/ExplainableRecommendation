Although this game is quite short (I finished it in around an hour and a half) it has one of the best stories of any game I've played.As I played, I learned about the Greenbriar family, and I really started to care about them. I was happy when I learned of their successes, and sad when I learned of their failures.And the way the story is told, through discovering everyday items in an everyday (though very large) house, is very unique, and effective. I discovered the characters' likes, careers, and personalities through letters and personal items. I discovered the stories of all the characters, and all were very interesting. The main story was compelling, heart-wrenching, and ulimately very- No, wait. I shan't say how it ends. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves a good story, and a beautiful game. You could probably get more time out of this game than I did if you take more time to read everything, fully explore every single room, and take in the atmosphere of the game. The regular $20 price tag is a bit steep for the time that I got out of it, and the time that most players got out of it, but if this game is on sale for $10 or less, don't even hesitate - buy it.
