Short and sweet:Do not buy this early access hoping for any lasting entertainment with friends.In it's alpha state the developers have not made it easy for player interaction through the game.The map is 220square km's! There are no vehicles yet, hope you like running aimlessly finding one of the 39 other players.There are a lot of useless items often with useless descriptions on how to use them.You cannot spawn reliably with friends, you must find them often taking hours.Zombies are still buggy and walk through doors and combat ridiculous.This review is for the current alpha state and to give a perspective for players wanting to jump in expecting a zombie survival experience with friends.This review will be changed when core mechanics are solid.
