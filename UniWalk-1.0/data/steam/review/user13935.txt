Brilliant game! mind bending.
i've spent so many hours playing this game and ultimately, they feel wasted. Don't wast any money on it. Buy something that actually works. The bugs and performance issues make this a painful play.
this game makes my duck hard
Brilliant and touching game. Something a little different. Something for players who want something more than guns and violence.
