I'd rate this game about 10/10. I know it could have done better but y'know.
This game is good ♥♥♥♥ if you play it in 20 hour bursts at intervals of about 20 weeks. Much potential but lacking in a lot of things. Fun with friends and can be alright playing alone but a posse is recommended. Needs better ♥♥♥♥♥ loot spawns though, jesus.
