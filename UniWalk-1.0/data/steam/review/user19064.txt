Overall a pretty good game with a big community. Generally, the community is alright except the occasional person who did seemingly everything with your mum. There is a lot of tactical play and stratagy involved in this game. I would give it a 9/10.
I used to play the classic version of King Arthur's gold which was more straigtforward and didn't have many 'interesting things'. However in this new version, it is much better as you can make so many things and be creative with how you build stuff. Basically, the only limit is your imagination. And maybe your ping xD. But that doesn't matter too much. I would give it a 10/10
