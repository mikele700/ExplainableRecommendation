Stunning Game, i guess the one thing i've always loved about the ArmA series is the MASSIVE-t range of community mods. So many new gamemodes are developed every few months you can never get bored.  9/10 (DLC's bit stingy)-t Stay Spooky-t
Absolutely Amazing, GTX 770, I7 4770 and 16 gb ram,  90-110 FPS without Vysnc on high settings. Runs amazingly. Alot more control then Console version.  9/10 (Online has some Errors). Excellent Release Rockstar.
