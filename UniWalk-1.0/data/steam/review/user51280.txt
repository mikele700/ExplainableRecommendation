An action-packed game that will certainly send chills through your spine at least once during the gameplay. If the main storyline wasn't horrifying enough for you, you can withness the events that happened prior to it in the Whistleblower DLC. The graphics in the game are excellent and the game is terrifying. However, the places to hide get repetitive as the game progresses because they look moreorless the same: lockers, under desks, etcetera.The encounters are filled with suspense and fear, although that fear becomes irritation and rage after a while. I believe this to be something that the game developers wanted. As time went by, you were just eager to leave the asylum and you began to play more recklessly and you felt like you knew the asylum, which is to your advantage. Overall, I think it's definitely worth playing because it was a very well built game. 9/10
