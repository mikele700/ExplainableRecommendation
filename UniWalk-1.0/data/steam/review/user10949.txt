Well. Where to start. Probably T or ct spawn. OVerall I can have fun playing this game. 700 hours (including the beta) taught me that even wehen you're playing with horrible people to make the most of it and have fun anyway.
I like good fun gamer time for me :)
Wow. This game had me on the edge. Tears and mead powered me through this. Absolutely stunning. I haven't cried this much since episode 6 of S3 of Vikings. The combat had me a bit overwhelmed so I put it on easy and that let me nejoy the game to the fullest. Simply incredible. Sk√•l.
