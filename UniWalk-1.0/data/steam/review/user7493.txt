Don't discourage this game just because there isn't much to do. Look at minecraft during alpha and compare it to what it is now. I definitely recommend this game and encourage others to support the dev team in building this game up and reaching beyond it's limits.
It's a really fun game and I easily got hooked on it (like I did with Minecraft :P) I was a bit skeptical when it first came out because of it's similarities with Minecraft but after several patches and updates, it feels almost nothing like minecraft.So yeah I highly recommend this game to people who love survival crafting horror games with a passion. There are some issues that does ♥♥♥♥ me off at times but you have to remember it's still in Alpha. I can see lots of potiential in this game and no doubt it will be a success in the near future.
Awesome and loads of fun, wished the game went on a little longer though. Love the guns and mods, love the creature designs and the challenges/side quests don't feel like an extra chore like most games.
