DLC with early access... your prioritys should be-Finish the ♥♥♥♥ing game-Then worry about DLC and other content once main content is finishedNOT-Start the game-Have constant updates and a good record then ruin it by making DLC because you decided to turn into a bunch of cash-grabbersSeriously guys wtf
Microtransactions ♥♥♥♥ing really???not cool overkill......
You go into this game having innocent intentions..... That dosent last long
