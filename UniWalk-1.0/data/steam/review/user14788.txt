This game brings back soooo many memories, it is one of my favourite games in the Oddworld universe and is still amazingly fun to play after so long! I strongly reccomend this game!
I am gonna say that this is a really ♥♥♥♥ game, but it isn't so much the game as much as the community. The people are toxic and the game may as well be a Sodium mine because they are all salty as ♥♥♥♥. The only thing I like about this game is destroying a fleet of people with an AWP.EDIT: Please leave me be, GabeN. First TF2 sucks me in, now this.
I can not reccomend this game enough to those who can get involved in a story and/or who simply like the shoot-em-up style of gameplay with a smidge of tactitioning (The Vigors etc.)Honestly, I had some expectations going into this due to the tremendous hype around it, but I can safely say that the hype was not ill-placed as the story is immensely interesting and gameplay is all-round smooth as can be.(Basically, if you like stories, you're gonna love this)Also, on a side-note, the DLC for this game is the first DLC for any game that I have actually considered worth the investment having completed it.There is endless possibilities for this universe and that is exciting.
10/10 would get a seizure again
no i dont recommend this -gaem-
