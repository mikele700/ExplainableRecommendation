I FOUND MY IN-DEPTH REVIEW! YAY!This is an amazing game. i highly reccomend it. it is full of entertaining cutscenes and intense third person shooter action. the mechanics of binary domain are absolutely stunning! each of the robots limbs have individual damage counters and the robots attack patters will change depending on the damage you do. for example: if you shoot a robots leg off it will start hopping around. if you shoot off both its arms it will run up to you and attemp to headbutt you and my personal favourite, if you shoot off a robots head it will start shooting at its allies! this is extremely useful in intense battles! you can pop up from behind cover, blast off a robots head and let the chaos unfold! one of the most entertaining parts of this game is the voice control. you can simply say something like; charge! and all of your teammates will jump out from behind cover and basically, spray n pray. it is quite entertaining to watch. but dont worry if you dont have a mic, you can turn off the voice commands in the settings menu. The storyline in Binary Domian is absolutely fantastic! i dont want to soil anything so i will leave it at that :P I highly reccomend you buy this game. i would however wait untill it is on sale as i completed it in around ten hours, and for $19 it a little on the expensive side.however this does not drain any of the fun from it!
