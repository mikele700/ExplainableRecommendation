I quite like Rust but it's definetly not perfect, Rust is basically DayZ, Minecraft and garry's mod combined into one game, for the most part it's pretty good but Rust is a bit Rusty at it's early stages (see what I did there) because as most of you know, Rust is still in early access which means developers are still working on the game and there's quite a lot of bugs (seriously there is) and it's the simple things like not getting into a server and not being able to craft items and other bugs and glitches that are really annoying, as it stands now, it's a solid game but I wanna see what happens for Rust in the future 20 bucks I think is a bit steep for what it is at the moment, but if you wanna give this game I try I say go ahead it gets an 8/10 rock holding cave men
Just.Get this game. Please. You'll thank me later. 10/10 screaming psycos
Chivalry is a great game and theres not much games like this around, I mean steam is over saturated with generic shooters that are not really unqiue in there own right, but chivalry studies the likes of the medievil times and the medievil times hasn't really been done in video games all that much,I mean you couldn't really count the elder scrolls games as medievil because there not there fantasy but back to chivalry, chivalry has some awesome gore splattering gameplay, some pretty good graphics and chivalry is just all around fun, if I could name some cons about chivalry it would be that In my opinon the price point is asking for a bit too much I mean you've got games like counter strike global offensive and garry's mod that's only 15 bucks and packs like a mind boglging amount of content, but Chivalry also has a bit of learning curve which is not a bad thing but it's just something to consider, Chivalry is an amazing game it's not perfect but it's a game you should definetly consider letting into your steam libary if you can find Chivalry on sale on steam definetly pick it up if you can you will not regret it (seriously you won't) it scores a 9/10 dismembered heads.
