This Is A Excellent Game,Gives Us The Opportunity Trade And It is uniquely good.With its hat simulator mechanic and item costing real money,this is a good game,however,valve still need to make the game cost slightly a little bit,maybe like 0.99 Cents is just enough.It is not like CSGO Which Cost Money And It Is Made By Valve But it has similar mechanics to this game thats why there is no f2p in CSGO.
Nothing
