Stardew Valley is a brilliant game, simple on the surface with its funny pixelart graphics and relaxing farm mechanics but delivers hours of fun and entertainment with the vast variety of new experiences, fishing with a fun mingame, foraging, farming, mining and making friends. I highly recommend this game to any fan of harvest moon, starbound or just a farming game in general.Also you can get high with a wizard in his tower!10/10
