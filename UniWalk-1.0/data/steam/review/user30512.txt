I got this game after watching many of the TearofGrace videos on it. It's hard, it's fun, and it will take up a fair amount of your time. The dlc for it (Afterbirth) is also pretty fun.
Had it on xbox for a while, but never got round to playing it. Steam sale comes around, pick it up. ♥♥♥♥. I think it might be better than 2...
It's good, not as good as Bl2, but is it worth 70 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars? No.I'm still recommending it though...
After playing DKS1 and 2, and digging into the lore, I can't view ANYTHING qithout making some stupid connection to Lordran or Drangleic.
