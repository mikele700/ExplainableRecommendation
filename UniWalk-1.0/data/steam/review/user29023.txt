One of the best Early Access games to come out. H1Z1 is Like Dayz but More in a Completed Status Still very Buggy but way more Play able but if you live any where besides Europe Or the Us Good luck on trying to find a server. i would say this is better than Dayz Better Controls  just better game in General I would recommend this to people with a Good Desk top or Laptop  as it may struggle with a Medium Range Laptop or Computer.
If you like Hard games this is the game for you
