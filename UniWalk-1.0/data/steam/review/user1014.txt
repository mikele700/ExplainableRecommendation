Papers PLZ, PLZ GIVE ME PAPERS. funny little game where you have to actually think about what your doing with every little thing like passports entry Tickets I.D's and the like you have to triple check everything. and it makes it pretty fun.
The base game isn't that hard but is still really cool to play, but to get a really good experience with Call of Pripyat you should get M.I.S.E.R.Y its a total overhaul of the entire game changing things Graphically aswell as gameplay wise, Misery adds a full feeling of every last bullet counts, every Dollar you have should not be wasted and if you wish to survive keep all of your gear in Top condition. Truly an amazing game that puts you to the test with every encounter. 11/10 would buy again.
when this game first came out i honestly did like it, but now after they keep on vomiting out DLC after DLC i realise how much of a shamble this game really is, graphically it did look nice but the gameplay was pretty standard and the Ai were worse then standard, does it really take a mastermind to make good Ai? cause seriously. DLC Quest legit aint got nothin on Payday 2 its kinda sad.
Good game if you like robbing banks, killing cops and randomly leveling up.
