Lovely to spend $142 aud to get the Season Pass and then to eagerly stay up all night while the game was downloading to eventually log on to play and can't even have a half decent game since the lag is crazy unless the settings are as low as possible where it looks like it was made in the 1990's. Thanks for the wasted $142 and motivating me to go and buy an Xbox 1. And no, my computer isn't ♥♥♥♥ and I can play most other games easily with out a trace of lag.
