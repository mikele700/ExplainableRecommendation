A must have. It is a first person game that can be played in any way you want. Stealth or go all out, its upto you. Enemies can be tricked and used. The abilities are very fun and can be used in many different ways to have fun through out each and every level. The level design was done well, where to reach a point, you can strategise and reach the point through a number of different options. Once there, you may play an assassin, but you don't have to kill anyone through out the game. The choice is up to you. Very good game to play multiple times, using multiple styles.
Very good turn based strategy game. Lots of funny moments. Games tend to go on for hours.
