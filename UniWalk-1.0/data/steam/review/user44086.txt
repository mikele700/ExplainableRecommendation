A hidden gem buried in the F2P section,though this game has been put on hold by the developers due to financial reasons,and is currently receiving no updates .This game's future remains unclear,and now is largely supported by its community who loves the game.This game is good,but has the potential to be much much better if it receives some polishing,like removing bugs and exploits,and reworking the shop and item system.It is a 3rd person fighting game,with its playstyle consists of dragon nest and street fighter crossover.Each character has its own unique combo,and pros and cons as well.A larger portion of the players are veterans at this game,so it may be frustrating for some newer players getting their asses handed to them,but once you read up some guides and get familiar with the game that is where the real fun starts.For those dragon nest and street fighter lovers this game is worth a shot,since it has elements from both games.As I said again,the game is currently receiving no updates meaning it might get stale for some players,but there are different characters to try out and master as well.Casual players are welcome as well,this game is really good at killing your boredom.
There shouldn't be any reason why this game isn't in your game library yet.
