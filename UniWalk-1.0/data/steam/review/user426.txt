Most amazing sandbox game EVER!Definitly get this game its a amazing ;)
I got this game expecting about an hour of joy, instead...instead it took over my life..What felt like a couple of minutes became 6 hours.Everything is Hexagon.
One of my Favourite games, keeps me coming back to play more, such immersive gameplay.11/10 would have high latency again.
Great combat, Great building,Great boss fights, Great game.
Can only use 2 races when playing online unless you own the other games...(Otherwise a fun game)
