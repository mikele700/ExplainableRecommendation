Garry's Mod is the best 'fart around' game out there. Most games only give you 100 or so hours of gameplay, Gmod is unlimited. Absolutly brilliant :D
Jolly good show chaps!
Cutting edge graphics with a slight cartoonish feel. First person perspective action game, I would recommend if you like 'Assassins Creed'. 9/10
One of the best zombie FPS games ever :)
