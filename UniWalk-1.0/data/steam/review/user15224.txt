Great game, great graphic style, great characters, great story, everything about it is great, as expected from TellTale, and the finale just leave you the needing for more. IÂ´ll anxiously wait for its second season.
really great story, characters, effects, backgrounds and choices that will judge your morality, totally deserves game of the year as its predecessor
