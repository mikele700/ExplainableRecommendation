This is a really fun game, but unfortunately, once you finally get the hang of it (and don't have three other plays to do co-op with), the game could be beaten rather quickly. Sure, there are these cute little challenges that you unlock afterwards, but they're just not the same.I recommend getting this game while it's really cheap, but honestly I don't think it's worth paying the full $14.99...it's just over so soon and leaves you wanting more!
Hilarious and cute game!Super Meat Boy is perfect for if you have little time,but still want to play something challenging.Tons of levels and characters!Also,there might or might not be a few game references! :D
