after waiting a long time after the console launch over a year im glad to say they got the game right. The story is a little bit short but gta online makes up for that. The game runs and looks great so i would recommend this game for sure.
this game is great fun!
great graphics easy to run does not take away from the original game
great game the attention to detail is amazing which we expect from scs. The game will always be getting better with new updates
