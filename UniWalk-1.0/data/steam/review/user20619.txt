Created a bunch of monks and converted an entire enemy army. 10/10
Really addicting game. Easy to run. Recommended for those who like music where each move you make depicts a beat.
♥♥♥♥ Uplay. Why should I have to use another service to play a game through steam? This is ♥♥♥♥ed. Get your ♥♥♥♥ together Ubisoft!
Really interesting. I like the old 80's style of it. Gives so many memories of when I used to load games from my floppy disk. Would be intriguing to see this game perform on an old DOS based computer.
Good. Buy it!
