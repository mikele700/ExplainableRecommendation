1/10... Steam has really low standards letting this game be released. The first game of 2015 i've played on steam is low. Atleast i'll appreciate other games much more this year. This game is more like a very early in development tech demo. I bet this game was made the night before released. Maybe the dlc will explain the gameplay. Just maybe. Anyway i'm a bit harsh 1.5/10 for a tech demo and 1/10 for a game.
