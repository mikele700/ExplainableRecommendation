PlanetSide 2 is far more polished than it has any right to be. The game contains three (soon to be four) vast battlefields, each capable of holding hundreds (if not thousands) of individual players, allowing infantry and vehicular warfare on a colossal scale.Described by many as Battlefield + Halo, this comparison is quite accurate, but PlanetSide 2 manages to dwarf both games in terms of scale and sheer ambition.Each of the six character classes and eight vehicles (five land, three air) each have their own large upgrade trees to complete, though the game encourages you to adopt a certain role over another, instead of being the jack of all trades. There are also a huge amount of weapons to collect, with no gun unfairly balanced. These weapons may be purchased with real money, but they may also be unlocked by simply playing the game.However, judging by my personal experience, leveling up seems quite slow (I have over 200 hours spent in-game, but I'm not even level 30 yet).Like most massively multiplayer games, PlanetSide 2 is best enjoyed with friends.TL;DR: Unless you have an atrocious download speed/cap, there is no excuse not to try PlanetSide 2.
