This is one of those games where there is no middle ground. You'll either love it to death or absolutely hate it. Honestly, ignore the thumb, because whether or not I'd recommend this game depends on the person. Some people will find endless hours of entertainment exploring the environments and finding creative ways to break the game, while for others, the novelty of goat ragdoll contortions will wear off within the first 20 minutes.My advice? There are ridiculous numbers of videos on YouTube of people playing this game. Watch a few, see if you think you might like it. If you do, then good luck and happy glitching!
