This is by far one of the crudest, most violent, most disturbing games I have ever seen or played...I love it! The freedom to explore and violate the townspeople is amazing, and I have never seen a game where there are so many benefits for such crude actions. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a person, watching them throw up, cutting off their head, and then playing soccer with it with a dog is so much fun, there is just no way I can see a game that can beat it. Although the graphics may be old, and some of the jokes may be out of date, this is an amazing game, one which everybody should own, even if it is as a guilty pleasure.
