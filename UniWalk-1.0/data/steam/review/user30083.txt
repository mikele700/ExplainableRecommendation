Awesome game, love the play style. one thing i would love to see in a future update is the ability to direct connect to a server via IP
gameplay was fun for like an hour, i dont like how the items you obtain are on a time limit, and also it is a tad glitchy
Much reccomend
Not a bad time killer, got sucked into it for a while
Free to play my ♥♥♥, this was a horrible waste of bandwith, unless you pay you will have one gun, only be able to hunt one type of animal, and not get anywhere, this game has potential and i hope the developers realise this and remove said paid elements of the game, its pitiful
