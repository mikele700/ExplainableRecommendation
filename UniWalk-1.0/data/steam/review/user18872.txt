Decent game (should be could Castaway Sim) but does get old quickly.8/10
Team Fortress 2 is one of the best free-to-play games ever. It is incredible how much entertainment I have actually got from this game. The classes are all fair and balance out easily. Although you can by things, none of it is, if you pay money you will win. Even with the default class weapons you can still achieve victory. TF2 is one of the best games out there, and hey, it's free-to-play, so give it a shot, it will be worthwhile.10/10
