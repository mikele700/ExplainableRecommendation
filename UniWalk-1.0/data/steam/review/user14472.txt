This game is best summarized as a pilgrimage. It's hard at first, but once you get used to it, it becomes all consuming. I got so invested in this game back when i only played on Xbox 360, that i ended sinking in 400 hours accross 6 or 7 characters. And when i finally finished the game, i felt so sad, knowing that i would never again enjoy a game as much as i did with Dark souls. It's just so perfect, challenging, but also VERY rewarding. I urge you to pick this gem up, and play through it atleast once. Although, believe me when i say you won't be able to stop.
IT'S THE GRINEER.
The only game where i can play as Darth vader on a quest to save Tamriel from Thomas the evil Tank engine. Helped along the way by my companion Naruto and my trusty steed, Tails the fox.
At long last the microtransactions are dead, once more Payday 2 is an excellent game.
Good game at it's core, decent shooting mechanics, with game modes and weapon skins that keep you playing. But it's ruined by it's horrible matchmaking system, and a community so braindead and toxic it may as ♥♥♥♥ing well by a huge sea of radioactive trash.
One of the best games i've ever played.
