This is a fun game that I enjoy playing, as you can see with my hours. It has a good story, characters and enemies. This is a good game to play with friends, the more friends you have playing the game with you, the harder the enemies are and the better loot you get. It has thousands of weapons and grenade mods, that you can choose from as you get further into the game. This game is about 30 hours long to complete the story if you are just wondering around, searching every area for epic loot. Overall, this game is great to play with friends, and has HEAPS of EPIC LOOT in every area.
I have played and finished the entire game including the secret final boss. This game was quite challenging in some respects, but after you figure out the algorithims of each Titan, you only need to find the right time to shoot your arrow or retract it and you have beaten the boss. I died about 290 times in this game, and almost gave up on playing the game anymore, but all you have to do is continue trying again and again, until you finally defeat the Titan. THIS GAME IS DARK SOULS+SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS together, if you rage-quit a lot I suggest that you don't buy this game.
