Sometimes after playing I close my eyes and think about what Ill do when I relaunch this game.Its mind blowing and brilliant!Addictive and very very time consuming.The Map is huge and sometimes you feel lost and worried your plans will crumble and youll be destroyed from all sides.. but be smart and you can accomplish VICTORY10/10
OH YEAH ITS A+++They did a much better job on the port. Well worth the 22$! The only problem I see is it doesnt support 21-9 :(
Great game only slightly ruined by all the timers.. timers on the map timers in play.. timers for everything..
Even in Alpha this game shows so much potential and even though the Alpha is very much an Alpha with a few game breaking bugs its well worth the purchase and time.. On retail I fully expect this game to be A++
Its Dark Souls 1 but in new areas.PVP is now intense and tons of variety!!!This game is NOTHING LIKE BLOODBORNE..because BLOODBORNE is just a lite souls gamesso this feels like a souls game9.5/10Near Perfection !
So addictive!! One of the most fun games on steam.. and its cross play with PS4 so its got heaps of aussies :) buy this !!
Its the greatest game since DS1 and its got all the DLC/Added Difficulty/New lighting/New enemy placements among otherthings..A++only a casual or a poser (fake fan) would not buy this..im buying 2 copies!!thanks from :)
Dont let the people who cant afford 20$ get you twisted..all these lil girls still play ARK to death even after they write a negative review.Game is probably the best EA game on steam and when it is finished I have no doubt in my mind itll be one of the best games.. how can I know this ? The game even in early stages commands respect.. Its brilliant.Constantly updates with free stuff almost monthly and for the die hard fans who can afford 20$ you can even buy a special desert map thats extra hard for a challenge.. completely optional though.Buy it and give it a go for yourself and ignore all the scum in the review section.
