ITS JUST ♥♥♥♥ING FUN
I think people are to harsh on this game. The community expected to much from a small game. It devilivered what it said was. A middle age surivial sandbox game with pvp elements. The community that still plays this game though scarse now loved roleplay and got extremly involved in the game. ANDS ITS PROBBALY THE FUNNIEST GAME OF ALL TIME!
