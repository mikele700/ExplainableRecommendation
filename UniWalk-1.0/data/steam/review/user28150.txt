Running down the street. Said hi to a passerby. He stuck the figure up at me. I shot him in the face. 10/10
Kinda like dayz, but without the bugs and with more stuff. And free.
The concept of this game is good, and for the low low price of free its worth looking into. HOWEVER. The repair costs in this game complely ruin any fun you might be having. Playing 10 games and earning 200 credits is no fun. Especialy when the next gun you want costs 4000 credits. Remove the repair system and the game is amazing.
Got a space ship. Space ship broke in half. Other half attacked the half I was in (with turrets). I died. 10/10.
Sooo good worth the 10 bucks!
