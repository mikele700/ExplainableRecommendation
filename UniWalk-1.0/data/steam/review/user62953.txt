10/10 would kuble wagon again.
Altough this is a mainsteam game and is now old (plus the graphics are not 10/10) i still think it is a fun game with a good story line and you can always play with your friends even though it is not like the gta v online its still good old fun.
This game, can be good at times, don-'t get me wrong. It can also be enjoyable, and playing with friends is great too, but there are some majour issues that need to be addressed. For example, for some reason (and not just me) when ever your ping starts to f*ck up, so does your fps, you can be running normally at ultra at 60fps on a 980 (like me) and then just randomly get fps drops that you think is just ping lag, before you realise, nope its your computer. I know somebody with a 980ti that also has the same problem. That-'s not the only problem, for some reason, i had these HUGE LIGHTS that were apearing out of no where, and almost making me blind. The PC Au servers, are also, terrible (at least there dedicated this time) but still bad, you can one round have the best ping, and then next, awful ping, and my internet isn-'t even that bad (and i have australian internet ahha). The games killing system and aiming could also be improved... *doesn-'t help that im not that good of an aim ahah* but still after playing CS:GO for example, i can be doing well in that, and finding that when i get killed its -oh okay, fair enough- and when i get a kill -well that was good- in BO3, its like when you get killed -OMG WHAT THE F*CK, HES HACKING OMG THATS SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T- and when you get a kill -no way i got that?- and thats just a few things to name. It-'s also very buggy, and you can tell that it has been rushed, either that or its just a bad console peasent to PC port. I had high hopes for this game, and im not impressed, at all. I did enjoy zombies though and found that enjoyable, and is most likely keeping me from refunding it, its just MP need-'s to be improved ALOT. Cheers
