After playing this all night, i have really enjoyed it. Even tho at first before i brought it; i thought it would be ♥♥♥♥. I was wrong :PPROS+ Dinosaurs+ Sprawling land that looks and feels absolutely huge+ Ease of Understanding (controls, objectives, etc)+ Simple Crafting (like minecraft)+ Early Access Perks (a cool saddle)+ Loot Boxes! + Taming and Mounts to ride almost anything+ Single Player+ PvE/PvP commands have been added for server hosting! < PvE the best!CONS- Optimization: Needs massive improvement i believe- Not being able to connect to servers/being kicked out of servers- Sound issues (music/sound not turning down properly even when adjusted) - Lag issues across the board. (Some experience it, some do not.)- Raptors (Not really a Con, they're just d*cks)I'm recommending it, but please keep in mind that this is a VERY Early Access game despite the fact that there is a lot about it that simply look
Fallout 4 s overall a great game! Fun and lovely company by those you find
