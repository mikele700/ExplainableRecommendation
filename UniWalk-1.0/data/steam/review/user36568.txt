from the creaters of the walking dead, i present to you, the wolf among us. a twisted an unhappy place where crimes are made in the town of the fables. Ecperience one of the most mind-bending, jaw-dropping twists you will see in all of gaming history...well, some of gaming history. SPOILERS: i really liked how bigby turns into his true form to fight all the bloody marys... its just like when neo fought all the agent smiths in the matrix. what i didnt really like is when i chose to lock the crooked man up it glitches my game and i start from the near begining where bigby fought the crooked man's crew, exept the guy who runs a strip club wasnt there. so i was really confused. but anyway i really recommend this game if you want twists and ♥♥♥♥ed up scenes.
this game is awesome,this game is ♥♥♥♥ed up and this game is so sad and depressing. if you want these types of games i would strongly reccomend youto buy it. its worth your money
