Addicting as hell. With so many game modes, and many more being made, this is a hard game to exit. DarkRP, TTT, Muder, Deathrun and more. So many gamemodes to keep you playing the game. Then the amazing workshop and addons, I had to move garry's mod to my D drive due to downloading so many addons. The sandbox is amazingly fun to play and I would recommend this game to anyone who likes multiplayer games. Even without internet the sandbox is increadbly fun to play with. Get this game if you haven't.
Why is this in my games list?
