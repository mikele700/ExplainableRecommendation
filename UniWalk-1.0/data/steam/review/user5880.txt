cant do anything its really horrible
its a great game just needs to be longer instead of 8 chapters i mean its great and the pro bending after the story is good just needs to be longer like they did with the other avatar games they where long and thats what this game needs to be longer i hope they bring out a DLC for it
Its A Good Game but its bloody stupid how you can reach the max lvl of 30 and yet other villians are over the lvl of 50 do i recommend this yes do i like the gameplay yes do i hate the lvl system yes do i love own hero/villian yes so i give it a Ken/10. the dlc's aint worth getting yes they maybe be good but serious 130 buck for every dlc on dc univerese honestly if the game is free so should be the dlc's
great game love the story to it and the fianl mission maybe tricky but is doable but still a great game
if you want a relaxing night well this is the game for you not much to do unless your a poker fan so you'll enjoy it have fun with this game i enjoy this game i give this game a rating or Ken/10
Love this game its really good got funny moments and funny and cool attacks from both player and computers i would recommenrd this to everyone
