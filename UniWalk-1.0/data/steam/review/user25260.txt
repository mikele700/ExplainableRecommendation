If the -2k GAMES- is gonna launch this, with paid access for $59.99 , I would rather think they would set-up some Multiplayers for this game. I mean, everyone can be a pro at playing this. Even after playing it, or even somebody called me to do something outside -- Well I-'d rather playing it 2x a day finishing it, wasting my damn 6 hours of playing it. I don-'t really want to make a refund to Steam / 2k Games community, because I would rather die if I don-'t have this, or got it refund from the first place! You see, I would really waste my damn time instead of doing something important. After that hours of finishing it, I was testing if I could play it from a Philippine-Made gamepad, but doesn-'t really work this year... And actually, if I didn-'t really bought this game at the first place, and sold it to TF2Outpost, what a waste of time, and got my future-me lazy. Not-but at least, I hope they will make a Multiplayer settings very - soon, and new DLC which I would like to call after-releasing new episode, the Burial at Sea Episode 2. I was expecting about it that, it could get cool after I-'ve played it. Anyways, thats -'bout it. May they release the new Multiplayer for playing, for the bright future!10 / 10, BRING BACK THE 3RD BIOSHOCK SERIES AS A G.O.T.Y (Game of the Year) OF 2014! Never ending of playing it, but happy to play it.(Updated since : 1 / 15 / 2014 (January 15, 2014)
