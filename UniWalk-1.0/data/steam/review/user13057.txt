If you are looking for a free fun to play horror game then you have found it.This Game has some of the best horror atmospheres that i have seen since the first amnesia game. Although in this game you are introduced to the monster quite early on. This game is also based on the creepy pasta character slender, if you didn-'t already figure that out, but this game changes it up so that he is not always behind you zipping around, but i won-'t spoil the actual mechanics because they are quite fun to play around with.Unfortunately this game does not handle well on weaker pc-'s so some people will not be able to see the marvel of the graphics, which in my opinion is some of the best i have ever seen in any horror game, second only to their original slender game- -Haunt: the Real Slender game-. Also this is a free game, yesFREE GAME!Although it is still in its alpha/beta form so it may not be on final release so I suggest you get it while you can. Also you are only able to play the first episode: 'Haunt-, but episode 2: 'Welcome Home-, to my understanding,, will be available for purchase (sort of like the walking dead game, where you pay for each episode) in the near future.So I am looking forward to buying all the parts but i have yet to finish the first episode because i keep dying from slender man or the various glitches in the game (keep in mind it is still in alpha/beta) such as falling thought the world.I recommend you try out this game whilst it is free to see if you like it, but in my opinion it has a great atmosphere that i think not many recent horror games have been able to achieve for quite some time and i really enjoy playing it.
