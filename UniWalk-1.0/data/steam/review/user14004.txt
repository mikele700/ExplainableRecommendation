Pros:Weapon drops -Balanced  -Variation   -CreativeBalanced overallFreeGreat community -Usually nice  -Help to update the game and add contentCharacters to cater for all play stylesConstant updatesMicro-trans dont make you win the game!And a but-tonne more stuff I could go thoughCons:Scammers within trading (obvious stuff)Toxic childrenAnnoying mic 'DJs'Final verdict:By far the best F2P on Steam, yet to find better or anything comparable, highly recommended. Anyone can pick it up and have a good time, even if your the worst player in the world and never touched a PC FPS. You can just join a casual server and people will often help. Very community based and constantly updates with new features and fixed old ones.9/11
Opinion of Each AspectGrading System- Based on a 10 point rating system.(10= Brilliant 7= Good, 5 = Average , 3 = Fine, 1 = Awful)Gameplay: 2/10Stability: 6/10Story: 2/10Controls: 3/10Graphics: 4/10Music: 6/10Sounds: 5/10Difficulty: 10/10Overall OpinionThis game is seriously ♥♥♥♥ed. Controls are ♥♥♥♥ed, camera is ♥♥♥♥ed, difficulty level is ♥♥♥♥ed. To be more specific. Controls: You click and your character moves there which would be fine in a situation where it doesn't have to be rediculously precise and your 'life' depends on it. Camera: Nice and easy to explain, wierd angle and makes the awkward controls even worse. The game is waaaaaay too hard, which doesnt help the awkward controls. I didnt even know there was a story besides at the start but I think there is?Overall Score3/10[h1Notes:[/h1](+ (Positives), = (Small Annoyances), - (Negatives))Nothing to say here, jjust not a very good game.

This is very clear by the fact it has a card game (nothing like triple triad) with cards you find from dead enemies, turn based fighting etc.The game has several fun mini games (Fishing mini game, bejewled rip off and more), amongst grinding out levels (which isnt really needed) and doing story missions which I didnt find very much interest in but I havent finished the game yet.Crystal Story has a nice sound track and art style. The music is soft but kinda nice, doesnt get too repeditive and is overall not too bad. The art has a cool style, nothing fancy or crazy but different and fair.Overall Score6/10[h1Notes:[/h1](+ (Positives), = (Small Annoyances), - (Negatives))+ Its fun, quick and cheap entertainment with little issues= Cheesy characters which are hard to take seriously- The art is great up close but the quality is terribly lowered when you are moving about dungeons etc in free movement mode
Pros:I dont actually know of any?Maybe it being cheap and gives a couple cards and such?Cons:Glitchy -Animations are clunky from time to time  -Zombies attack without animation   -Zombie attacks dont have to touch youGenuinly boringLack of progressionLack of rewarding and motivation to playBroken multiplayer...The list drags on.Final verdict:Not a good game, doesnt really matter since I got it in a cheap rubbish bundle for the trading cards.1/10
