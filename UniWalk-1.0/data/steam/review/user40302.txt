Build a stair case, Delete wrong piece, Whole thing crumbles.... 10/10
Has potential, I felt like I was playing Diablo, Has a good feel to it, looks beautiful and feels like it could really go somewhere.The good:Large areas to exploreSimple controlsVariety of enemiesThe bad:Massive FPS drops at random times ( down to 11 fps )Some areas can feel emptyChanging graphic settings can take a while and leave you with no textsThough the build we are given and I did expect bugs which I did stumble across, Itâ€™s nice for what it is though feels like it was released a bit early even for an early access game, I had gotten through everything fairly quickly and explored where I could, But as I previously stated, It has potential I can feel it.
