ME2 is possibly one of the best games i've played, i felt like i was in the game, making decisions that affected friends and foes. I would give it a 5 but it does have some glitches such as the Tuchunka Shop, i got stuck in the wall several times. But nonetheless, ill give it a 4.5
Wouldnt Really Recommend This Free To Play, It Restricts Character Customization And Limits What THe Player Can Do
