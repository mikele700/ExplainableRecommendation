Where do I begin?Terraria is an amazing game that always leaves you with something to do.This game never disappoints. Want to ride a unicorn while shooting out rainbows? Terraria can do that. Want to fight a giant eye belonging to a dark lord? Terraria can do that. Want to shoot a gun that is also a shark? Terraria can do that. Words cannot describe Terraria. Just get the bloody game already, it's awesome.
holla holla get dolla
Well, it's decent at least.At first glance this game looks like another one of those terrible simulators.But, it really isn't.Great graphics.Not completely broken.
Unusable. Not worth your time. It's a waste of space on your hard drive. Do not get this. Get Garry's Mod, it's better than this cancer.
Why do people like this?It's ♥♥♥♥ing garbage. Would've been fun in the early 1990's.
