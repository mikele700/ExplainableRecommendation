Giving this game to a strategy fanatic is like giving a drug addict crack cocain.
Extremely steep learning curve, much persistance is needed to become good. However if you push beyong that difficulty barrier, you really feel that this game was worth going through all that suffering and trial-and-error for an unbelievable feeling of accomplishment.
From the creators of Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaaac is one of the most interesting and unique Indie games on the market. Every play through is a blast and you will never have the same run twice as there are randomly generated rooms and floors to explore. However in some aspects the game's enjoyment is withered and incredibly frustrating within the first 10-20 hours of gameplay, and as a result you will die ALOT.One of the finest elements that refine the game is it's randomly generated level, this gives the player LOADS of replayability and intrigue in what might happen next time I play. With these randomly generated levels, the designers also placed over 20 bosses that get more and more challenging as you progress and strategies may need to be employed to bring them down. But it doesn't stop there, there are close to 100 items that you can collect which alters the game mechanics and even your characters appearance, and that's not even including DLC. With every game there are the negatives and we must discuss them, so what's wrong with this game? Well the first 10-20 hours will kick you in the ♥♥♥. You will die many, many times and if you don't learn from these mistakes and adapt to an enemies fighting capability you will keep getting your ♥♥♥ kicked. Also be prepared to open up a wiki because when you pickup an item for the first time, there is no telling what it will initially do. However if you can manage to have the patience to get over that first 10-20 hour hurdle, then the game will be a blast.Too long didn't read, let me summarise:                   **Positives**                                                                                                         +Randomly generated levels                                                                     +No two runs will be the same                                                                    +Tons of unique bosses items and enemies (also mini bosses)               +Comedic tone and references throughout game                    **Negatives**-Almost sadistic first 10-20 hours-No item descriptions/ blandly tells you item functions (WTF!?)-Almost unplayable without consulting the WikiThis game is undoughtably fun, don't let those negatives throw you off, this game deserves to be played. I payed $10 for this game, and Iv'e probably milked about 5 times it's value out of it. For $5 on Steam + $3 DLC (that you should only buy once you've completed the game several times) this game is a bargain and deserves your utmost attention.**9/10**
