Very nice for anyone who needs to keep up to date with current day technology or you just gets bored even good for an amicher just starting out and wants to know what a car mechanic does
Good game first time i have played when you get to be a hero in hell and kill the devil only to take his throne an excellent way to possibly end the series 2,3 & 4 are also worth the play everything from superpowers to flying with wings (gat out of hell) the 7 sins weapons are good to use esp the chair it also shoots rockets i have spent time just doing all the sides but all in all a little bit too short the main missions for my liking
Lots of fun i thought the septic truck missions were cool and the side missions were cool to get rid of the competition only thing that I didn't like was that when you upgraded a car once it got destroyed say good bye to it other than that i really enjoyed the game
beter than gta game series and alot more effort put into the manufacturing of the game and also has multiplayer campaign
