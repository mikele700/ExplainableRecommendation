I could virtually go on and on about the aesthetics of this game but for the sake of writing a review I'll review the Pros and Cons  ★ ~ ( ◡ ‿ ◡ ✿)Pros- Amazing soundtrack- Beautiful lighting and stunning graphics- You can stare at the sun and marvel in its virtual beauty without blinding yourself and/or gaining superpowers- The world resets every 24 hours, giving you a fresh new battlefield everytime you startor more things to crash yourself into- Intricate Level Editor, for those who are into that stuff- Controller support- Multiple unlockables such as ship modifications, enhancements, level items, etc.- Seamless gameplay- Leaderboards for the Asians competitive playersConsAs of now, I really can't find anything to complain about. I'll have to update this review eventually prior to the updates.tl;drIs this game really worth my time?  Yes, it is (well, at least, in my opinion anyway). Aside it being free from charge, I don't really see any harm in downloading Race The Sun just to give it a shot. Definitely a different and refreshing pick from the family of Indie games.
