This game is fantastic, yes there is a few performance issues bu8t in nearly 40 hours I have had only a signle crash and the game had autosaved that very turn. It does a great Job of being Enemy Unknowns sequel while also feeling delightfully fresh. I never get quite the same tingles beating regular story games as I have from the recent Xcom series.
I havnt actually played it yet and will update when I do, But im just blown away by the commitment that stardock has to its games and fans, I was starting to lose hope for a sequal to this series and then BAM dlc for the original??? Thankyou very much stardock, looking forward to a sequal somewhere down the line :)
