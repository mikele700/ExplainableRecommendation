Civilization 4 is the last to really the last edition that remains true to the traditional Civ formula. It adds the additional element of religions which creates an interesting gameplay as you try to convert other civilisations to the religion you found - so that you can make more money. It's also great that Leonary Nimoy has lent his voice for the technology and wonder achievements.
