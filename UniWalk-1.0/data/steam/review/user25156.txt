It was the most amazing experience ever!!! even for a free game it is amazing!!! I loved the atmosphere the AI and the story line it was one of the best games I have played. Only 1 problem: Just a little bit too short but I cannot wait until they make    ACT 2 (if they do) its gonna be a heap of fun, just dont get rid of any aspects of the game they are what make it unique. And I probably would have payed money for this game. (maybe if it were longer) Good luck one the 2nd and dont take too long I'm waiting
