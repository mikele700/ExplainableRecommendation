i would write a review, but it be filled with spoilers and the like, which is 90% of the game. just play it for yourself.
The game is very good, and test your abillities to see if you can move to the beat either with a dancepad or button presses, but i have one issue with the product, and thats when files corupt. when the file corrupts, its practically gone forever, and ive tried everything to fix it, but nothing has worked. it puts a damper on my gameplay experience when i know its going to be gone as soon as i load the game again. if that was a issue that was fixed, i would give it a better review, but it in the end, i still had fun playing.7.4/10 good to play, doubt i could beat it with the curent circumstances.
