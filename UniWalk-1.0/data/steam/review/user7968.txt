Globally banned without warning for accidently having Cheat Engine open when speeding up FTL and being invited to play ARMA 3. BattleEye needs some work. Otherwise, the game is very well optimized and good; even the single player campaign was well worth it.Just be careful with your key and make sure to close any potential blacklisted executables.
It's okay.
