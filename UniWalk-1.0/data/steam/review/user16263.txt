I recommend all third-person loving players to give this game a go and a couple of hours, it does take a while to get use to the game, but once you get started you really start to enjoy it, does have some connection problems but it-'s close to 0, and i have ran into a few hackers in the last couple of weeks, but the new -FairFight- anti-hacker software works very well.
