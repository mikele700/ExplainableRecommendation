Warning: You will waste your life away on this gam. This is easily my most played game in my library, with over 400 hours on record. An excellent team based, fps that is updated frequently with additional content, fixes, maps, weapons and more. An aditional warning though, if you buy this game, say goodbye to your wallet, YOU WILL SPEND ALL OF YOUR MONEY ON POINTLESS SKINS FOR YOUR GUNS WHICH DO NOT EFFECT GAMEPLAY WHATSOEVER. Do not say that you were not warned.
