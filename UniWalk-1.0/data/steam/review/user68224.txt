One does not simply have Steam without having TF2. 10/10
A great mature Noir mystery, set in New York - or Fabletown, as the various fairytale characters that live there call it. Some of Telltale's best work, and of course, they leave a cliffhanger at the end. Still hoping for a season two, Telltale.
