So. When i first stepped foot on starbound i though it was like terraria or minecraft but i was completely wrong i decided to pre order the game since i had extra money to spend as i wanted to get a new game. When i received starbound when it realesed i had no idea what i wast stepping into three years ago.When i started i was in shock, i had realised this isnt like the most games i had in my computer,if you fast forward a few years i was HOOKED  the always upadating gameplay made me happy,when i played the nightly version i was amazed new updates every day?!Man you devs mustve worked hard.Well let me just make this quick if you want to buy the game GO FOR IT! its something the majority would probably love...~Raptor, the starbound fan that should probably get outside more
