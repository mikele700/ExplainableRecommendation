One of the best horror games ive ever played, has you on edge the entire way through! 10/10
fun game, pretty ♥♥♥♥ed up but is awesome! 10/10 would bang!
Not as easy as people think it is, requires some skill and practise, really fun, lots of kill stealing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but overall great game, 10/10 would smite again!
my dream of becoming a super saiyan is true!! 10/10 would destroy eveyone as Beerus again because they stole my pudding!!!
