At first I couldn't really get the hang of this game and I stopped playing, I came back to it for another try not to long after and fell completly inlove with it, playing it day after day to make the world I wanted.The world really is your canvas.If you ever need a buddy to show you the ropes or just play it with I'll be more than glad to join you
