Welcome to a revolutionary FPS, with graphics that inspiried 2007 runescape, to rpg elements that had never been thought about before, this game has it all! Remember how half life 1 and 2 changed how we play fps. SS2 did that before they were released. Music is hip, and there are no quest markers = you have to find out what the ♥♥♥♥ you are doing, how to do it and how to get the ♥♥♥♥ back so you don't die. 9.9/10 IGN
