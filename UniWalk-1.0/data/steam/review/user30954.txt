This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing piece of art.
You know what really  -GRINDS MY GEARS-  No one playing a zombie survival game-'s survival mode.  Ok who gives a crippled arab ♥♥♥♥ing a horses mangled testicles ?  I DO Geniunely it isnt that bad.  Good gra♥♥♥♥♥s  Well balanced (sometimes)  A community that will listen to your pleas before killing you with the utmost -morality-  An Australian server  And the ability to  MENTALY ♥♥♥♥ OVER  every player. ButI ask why...Why does one of the best zombie survival games have more people playing its -Secondary- game mode...WellIt-'s probaly because the game is like an elephant.It-'s bigIt-'s slowIt-'s hard too keep enclosed It has big -ears- (you know what i mean)And it takes a massive ♥♥♥♥ on anyone following it for too longHave you heared the phrase -There-'s an elephant in the room-  Well that just slots in with this game so well. I havent played much ... yet.But i can already see a dinstinct pattern StartFind lootGet killed by Screaming road raging 12ie-'s And repeatUntill about your 10th - 15th timeThen you will notice this other game modeCalled - Battle Royal -This game is not a zombie survival gameIt is A zombie battle royal survival game.
Realy good to start off (lots of exploring ect) but once you progress too far it gets repeditive Pros-♥♥♥♥♥♥(s) in chat-Amazing Exploration-Satisfying loot drop system-Building (no MC 12vies)-People who make giant ♥♥♥♥♥ bases and place them infront of you-DungeonsCons-Laggy servers sometimes-Annoying payed stuff-Lack of common sense
Cons : not very polished, glitchy, not much to unlock Pros : great soundtrack, multiplayer, cool item ideas,  good boss fights Pretty much binding of isac for people who want to play with friends.
