I'd put this as one of the best PC fps games. Its straight to the point. Just shooting and killing, no campaign or stuff like that. For a 15$ game, the details has been gone through pretty well and the game mechanics are interesting. Although it does take practise to get good, and very satisfying when you rank up C:

Super smash 4 dayz dard
Who said its not playable on a macbook air? I play just fine with 30fps, lowest settings, lowest resolution. So low that i can barely read chat10/10 would sacrifice graphics to play again
