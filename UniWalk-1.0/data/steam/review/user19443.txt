I used to play this game hours on end. Unfortunately, when i came back, the community was dead, there were no players anywhere apart from the few newbies wandering through the starting area hoping to find a good game. I would only recommend this if you like grinding hours on end and spamming repeats to level through most of the game as well as completing raids with only a few party members and in most circumstances, by yourself.
