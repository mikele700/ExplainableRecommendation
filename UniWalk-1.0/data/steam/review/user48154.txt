GREAT game best MOBA you can get for free. If you have played league of legends it is like that but better. it takes alot of skill the graphics are good for a MOBA and the game feel is amazingit has made countless hours of fun this game is the best MOBA out there today expessially if you have friends to play with.I highly recommend this for new players to MOBA games and experienced players.
so fun, cant stop playing it
Great game but every time i play the game about 30 minutes- 1hr it crashes without a error message then it starts to load again but it doesnt load fully so i have to close it and re open it. it looses all my saves that i made and dosent give me my xp that i made. there is no point for me to play it as it does not work i thought it was a gonna be a great game and would spend lots of time on it but it doesnt work
