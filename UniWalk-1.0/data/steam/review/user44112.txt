This game is very enjoyable for a little sitdown in the afternoon, The puzzles are fun and some are a little hard but when you get them you feel good and that is a great feeling. It has some bugs and issues. The music in this game is amazing 10/10. i saw alot of people hating on the voice actor and i feel bad for him because i actually enjoyed his voice alot. The plot twist is amazing and the fast pased intence monents are fun, expecially the one where you only have 60 seconds to escape i loved that. all in all i really like the game and i admit its not living up to Portal2 but this game is still fun but would be better if you didnt have to purchase it, kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥. 7/10
