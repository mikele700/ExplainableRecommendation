A highly addictive game for the right reasons.My girlfriend and I often sit at the same blackjack table for funsies.
The game is good, it's not worth $60 AUD.You can lose hours without thinking about it whilst playing this game. What I value most is that you can play this and chill whilst listening to music.Long story short; Don't buy it today, wait until it's discounted.
