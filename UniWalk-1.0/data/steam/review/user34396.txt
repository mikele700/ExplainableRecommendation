Trine 2 is a beautiful game with charming characters. There are plenty of clever puzzles that can be solved multiple ways. The environment is detailed, colourful and makes the platforming a little more difficult when you get distracted by the pretty flowers in the background. I would recomend this game to anyone who is looking for a great puzzler with incredible locations and likeable characters.
