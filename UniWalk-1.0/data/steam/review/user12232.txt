In its current state, I can-'t recommend this game. I can play BF4 at ULTRA getting 50-60 FPS, but this game is unplayable with everything on low. Yes, I am impacted by the AMD glitches, and yes, I updated to beta drivers, it doesnt work. I can-'t even get past the first level because of how laggy it is. I dont care about NVIDIA waveworks, and hairworks, and gameworks, whatever. The game should work just as well on all systems, and its like Avalanche completely forgot AMD existed. The -Quality Assurance- manager is a bit of a joke considering how unplayable this game is. Do not buy it until it is fixed.
