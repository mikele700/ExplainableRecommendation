29/8/15Personally i think Starbound is excessive in a good way.It has a mass of different places to explore along with so many features and quest rivalling terreria.The main point is that there is still more to come and with so many features, every addition is welome to an already pretty completed game.
This game is one of the best Co-op zombie games that rivals Cod zombies. Instead of slow and tough zombies like most other zombie games, L4d2 gives you tonnes of fast and weak zombies with some special more powerful ones to mix things up. Its great to use the melee for the first time killing tonnes of zombies especially with your friends. Also unlike COD l4d 2 and 1 has that great feeling of euphoria when you either: complete a story part or find somthing good like pills or the M60.And the only reason people really have negative reviews is because of the professional types of player/players which, actually has decreased with more new players coming in and pros now only appearing in versus.10/10 NOW GET THE DAM GAME AND KILL THOSE DAM ZOMBIES
This is a testament to the fact that great mods and games come out of the half life series.Half life 2 may had some boring times (probably because it is a bit outdated) but in this game there were none. I do reccommend not having so many locked doors in the sequel. Also kudos to the ability to acess a computer.
The game is good no doubt. But im pretty sure the ability for Dy-no-mitte is broken.
Being able to jump into a perfectly stategised tower arrangement  is amazing along with the arsenal of weapons and perks that are both gamechangingly overpowered.
