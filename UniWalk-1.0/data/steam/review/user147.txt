Is this game actually Free to Play ? I don't think so. You can only hunt ONE animal in the game. The rest you have to buy... with REAL MONEY. How can this one is free to play? DON'T play this game, it doesn't even worth your time. Hell, you have to pay to play multiplayer!That being said, ♥♥♥♥ this game and the devs.
