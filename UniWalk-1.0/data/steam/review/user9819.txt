Campaign:The campaign mode is full of fun missions and secrets to be discovered, the story line is great, and the characters are amazingPros:It's a lengthy campaign, which will keep you entertained and coming back for moreThere are Hidden secrets to be found throgh out the game like swords and moltovs etcThe characters and storyline is exceptionally well, i enjoyed killing Menendez ;)ConsThere are not a whole lot of skins, as in good guys/ bad guys most of them are the sameMultiplayer:Multiplayer is very fun, unfortunately the very first game i played i was unfortunately bullied by other players, which is sad that the community is very disresepctful to other players, no one helped but they joined in. In other words if someone starts something with you while your online they will most likely gang up and join inPros:Fast paced shooting gameVery wide selection of guns and maps, dlcs etcCons:Community is appaling A few bugs/ erorrsHacked lobbies and HackersZombies:Zombies by far has been the wors experience for me, Over all zombies was my fav but unfortunately there was a Hacked lobby, like i said before, and he rigged my money, health and ammo, which sure it was fun to be able to use the mystery box over and over again and open all the doors on the DLC i used my money on >:( but later i got the blame and was unfortunately VAC banned when first of all this is not a steam game its a treyarch game, and second of all i was the victim yet i was banned and the hacker for some reason wasn't (LMAO) and still runs around to this day. No wonder steam got an F in supportPros:The best ever, dlc's maps, ray gun just amazingZombie bosses omlDlc's are well worth your moneyCons:Far too many hackersPing goes extremely high in lobbies sometimes, there needs to be a more local connection rather than connecting with people on the other side of the worldHackers manage to find simple map explloits which can then lead to even bigger map exploits.Over all my experience would be an ok game, i would give this 6.5/10
