~Personal Review~Pros:Crafting - Literaly everythingHouses - Build whatever you want from a wide selection of materials its awesome!Weapons - Many to choose from ranging from starter spears to rocket launchersLeveling - Increase base stats + Engram points that allow you to unlock certain building featuresDino - Lots of dinos + taming!Group exp - Gain more exp near tribe members! So there is an added bonus to play with friends!Cons:Houses - Building structures for houses are really expensive. Especially if you have a low gathering speed on the server properties, just trying to build a wall could take you maybe 5 minutes?Leveling - Since i play on an Unofficial server it was not long ago that i found out the unofficial servers have a lower experience rate, hence if you do play i suggest when making a server to raise up the expResource - Collecting resources take forever! as i said buildng a structure takes 5 minutes for 1 wall just by UPing the gathering speed to lets say 3x makes a world of a difference, though keep in mind its a little OP against trees.Dino Agro - Even though the game is designed to play alongside dino-'s I cannot stress at how much i hate certain dino-'s such as the spinosaur! its equivalent to a -creeper- in -minecraft- for me.Combat - Combat depending on how good your internet is or what server you-'re playing on, can either be okay, or SUPER LAGGY! though i am now playing on my friends server i don-'t experience combat fighting issues.Solo - The game is EXTREMELY boring playing by yourself. IMOFirst spawn - There is no tutorial on how to do things, so it is really confusing on how to learn to do anything, hence it is not very -noob- friendly, It took me a while to make anything lol.Interface - The interface to your inventory or crafting system can be improved, imo its very confusing for me, though you get used to it, it took a while and everything is scattered everywhere.TL;DRIf you want to play this game, make sure you:Host a serverPlay with friendsUP the EXP and Gathering RatesWatch a how to start off in ARK videoENJOY :D
Well, aside from the fact its a point click shoot game, since anybody can do it, thats why its challenging
