this game is awesome better then console because of my pc i always play maxed out its so realistic and i just cant name anything special its also an exact simulation of robbing only difference is that u can go further out when realy doing it :) XD
It's a fun game along with its mechanic's the physic's to break at times but it becomes comedy.
Compared to alot of thoughs sandbox and survival based games dont have any where near the features that this provides this beats rust no questions asked there are games like minecraft that can outrank this in some ways but it looks amazing good quality for the early access :)
