Huge ♥♥♥♥ing waste of time. I waited ovenight for this to dowload only to be ♥♥♥♥ed over by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ patcher that makes the game impossible to play. I turned to the forums and tried everything to get this peice of ♥♥♥♥ working but to no avail. My download speed varied from ~1100 mbps (yes, megabytes, i live in australia so i dont even know how the ♥♥♥♥ this is possible) to negative (yes, negative) 10 mbps. Its a real shame because im sure this is a fantastic game but it will remain unplayable until the patcher is fixed. 2 hours of trying to get this ♥♥♥♥ to work and 0 seconds of gameplay. I am extremley unimpressed with this service. I will fight for my refund.
