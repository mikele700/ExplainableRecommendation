should re-name it to CS:GO ♥♥♥♥ yourself, if you aren-'t immediately terrific then you will get destroyed and have to wait in anguish for the next round.All because your mate said -it-'s good- and you got it for seven bucks you expect fun, you expected wrong ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.9/10 ~ It-'s ok.
i think there might be a mistake, i mean i bought this game but there was no robots or portal gun or anything, there aren't even any puzzles, like how did IGN give this a 9.5/10?-69/911
This game will always be one of my favourites, its just the perfect game to play when you-'re staring at your steam library thinking -what game should i play?-.It has something for everyone, whether you-'d like to take it slow (heavy) or get right in there fast-paced, or just sit and burn stuff (pyro), you will enjoy this game, not just for its comedic undertones but for the diversity between the characters.9.5/10 - not enough hats  ~PSYCAT
