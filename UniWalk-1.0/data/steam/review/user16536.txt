this game (exuse my language) is ♥♥♥♥ing incredible. The gameplay is great and the gunplay is fun. The story is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing as most bioshock games with lots of twists and turns and you start to feel for the characters aspecialy when the plot starts to thicken. So i would recommend this game to anyone and even to someone who hasnt played bioshock before. SO WHAT ARE YOU READING THIS FOR....BUY IT ALREADY
