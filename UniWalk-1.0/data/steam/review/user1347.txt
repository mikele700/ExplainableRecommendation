Strangest genre I've ever played, but really cool.
Ever wanted to 1v1 a shark? Now's your chance!!!
Good campaign, I would put it up there with the original Fable and DA: Origins. Plenty of sidequests and lore to get caught up in, and a surprising ending. Worth a play for any fan of RPG's; just wait until its on sale.
Crashed and glitched on my computer. The settings didint allow for enough change to make it work on my pc.
Great fun, the graphics and missions are great for single player and multiplayer,
is epic
