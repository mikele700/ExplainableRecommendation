One of the best sci fi series to come out of gameing ever is mass effect. and Mass effect two in my opnion is the best one in the 3 games.
Basically it is Lara Croft before she was complete badass, curse destroying, treasure hunting women we know her as in the previouse games...Don't get me wrong she was still a badass in her own way in the game (escpecially later) and thats the hole point, it shows her growing as a person and becomming the Lara croft we all know and love. The graphics are buitifull if you have a PC that can handle it.Know are the controlls bulky likt the other tomb raider games? NO. No they are not and i have to say no matter what situation she's in the controlls are smooth and wonderfull compared to the other games. there are nit piks here and there but as a hole an AWESOME game definatly recomend buying it. its one for the steam account.
