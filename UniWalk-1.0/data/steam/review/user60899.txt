I love the game. It's really simple, but the sliders don't tell you what exactly what the percentage is, which is quite annoying. I think the sliders are a bit too transparent. But for every other aspect of the game, I loved it.
It's quite a fun game, but difficulty may get higher as you keep playing it. Great game so far! You can choose gamemodes. Just don't overfill your stations!9.5/10
This game is quite fun! Great graphics and achievements! Just remember to turn off explicit content if you want to. There's fun slides, you can fly to space (literally).9.5/10
