Thanks to mods this game seems like a hilariously bad fan-fiction
I hate this game. And it hates me backSo i guess thats fair.
Its all fun and games until a legandary prisoner with an 800 year sentence and over 20 convictions of murder arrives and kills everybody.
This game taught me how swear in 17 different languages 10/10
Nearly spent 2000 hours in this gameevery second is worth it
