Needs a bit of work and is overpriced but is still a hell of lot of fun, get it while its on sale and bring friends
if fast paced action is what you want look no further
great game dont know why its so unpopular but im only half way through.
Good follow up to the first game. Hoping for a 4th bioshock game thats closer to the first 2.
great game. need more people to play and Austrailan severs. but great game
guns, dino and Jetpacks what more do you want?
