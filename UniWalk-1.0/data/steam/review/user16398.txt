Cool game. It's hilarious while playing on singleplayer.
I'm so glad to see this game on Steam.
The graphics looks pretty good. I like the setting of the game.
Really cool mod. It's fun to play this with your friends.
This game rules! The graphics doesn't matter, the gameplay is.
Fantastic game, very addictive, the most fun you can have online. There's alot of game modes, maps, items and, most of all, HATS!
This game is great. The story is unique, amazing and, awesome!
Awesome game. Fun with co-op friends. It's challenging, alot of puzzles to solve, and over all smooth game play.
