Unturned to put it simple is an overload of multi player gold, with simple mindcraft inspired graphics, this Zombies survival sandbox is not only fun too play by yourself but even better with a group of friends. From cutting wood and mining stones to make a base for yourself, to exploring the nearby zombie infested towns and military bases to scavenge for the essentials to surive, this game has everything you would expect in a zombie survival game from the game mechanics (Having the need to constistently look for fresh food, water and keep yourself non-infected) to the ombience of the game it makes it a very enjoyable game too play.
Undoubtely one of the best First Person Shooting games i've played on PC. There are many different game modes which you can play and such a massive global community for this game. The in-game mechanics are very easy to learn and play with, the graphics both amazing and well detailed, I would reccomend Counter-Strike: Global Offence to anyone who is looking for such a multi-variety shooting game.
Stunning graphics that make the game have a satisfying atmosphere. The level system in this game works well as well as the character design. Vast spread open world with many quests to take part in and friendly PVE areas with friends. 8/10
Dead Island, it's everything you'd expect an multiplayer zombie hack and slash game too be, with it's amazing graphics and well written story line, the only negative thing you can say about the game is that Newzealands with Australian accent's just DONT WORK. The Cheesy dialogue is enough to make anyone break out in laughter and the gaming mechanics is overall a walk in the park.
