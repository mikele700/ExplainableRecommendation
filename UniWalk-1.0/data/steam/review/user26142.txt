I love a good space strategy game but this didn't reel me in like I thought it would. It's very Sid Meier-esk with its tech tree and diplomacy, and I found dealing with other races to be quite rigid and predictable. It's a bit of a slogh with keeping up food, production and tech, unfortunately there's no innovation with how that played out. I tried to play very tech and diplomacy heavy (i'm a lover, not a fighter) but had to fight out a few unwarrented battles which wasn't that exciting.Overall, it's okay. Smooth graphics, soundtrack was nice, a few quirky tidbits but nothing really keeping me there. I'd wait for a sale to get this one, it's a good time waster.
Very much still an alpha build. I really hope that this improves before it's full release. I would be much happier with a graphics rehaul of RTC3 than what they have tried to do with RCTW. Please make it better and listen to our feedback.
Fun, but not worth the full pricetag. Wait til it's on sale.
Since buying this game, I haven't had the desire to go out and find a man to fill the empty, lonely void in my life. Finding a man would only get in the way of playing more Fallout 4.
If you loved Sim Tower then this is for you. A little bit more in depth than the original title however I cant see much repeat gameplay happening unless they expand on it. It's nice that it's open to modding however.
Really addictive for something so morbid.
