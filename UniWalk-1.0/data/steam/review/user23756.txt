All i can say, is that this needs co-op. So i sit down with a friend and say -Okay, lets go kill this stupid boss.- Like really.. Hopefully they make a number 2 {they may be already} and make it co-op. You can only make this game better by being able to run around with a friend chopping things with a sword that with rediculous traits.
One and all, gather round for all new jaw dropping game that has been out for a few years now. This game pretty much puts everything you want to try into one. May if be making a giant ♥♥♥ catapult or a flying car. This is where you try it.
I once dream't of chopping a zombies head off with a katana.. Well this game made that happen. There is also plenty of mods on this game that you could try out, giving you more zombies to go agaisnt and more difficulty options. I may only have 92hrs but this game is bloody great.. Watch out zambies, here i come :P
One of the best story lines and one of the best evil guys ever in this game right here. Really, got play this game and you be surprised at how much youll love it. That is if you like shooting random bandits and saving people for Raks. :D
Awesome game. Fun if you just wanna watch people run around with no head. Already got me kinda hooked other then the only way to customize your character is to buy coins with money :/ Other then that, good weapons only take 1 or 2 battles to be able to build. So go on, build some stupid weapon that will have the other guy rolling his eyes at you when you kill him.
