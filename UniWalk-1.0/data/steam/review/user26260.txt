I enjoyed this game so much that i played it for six hours straight, so I just finished the game and its 3:30 am where I am and I went to lay down and go to sleep but the game's ending made me keep thinking of other possible outcomes and I just couldn't sleep and so I decided to write a review for the maker's of this game and give them props for making this game and releasing it for free to, if the game studio responsible for this game ever releases extra content for this game expect me to be there purchasing it because I love this game. 10/10 definetely play this if you have the time.
