This is one of those games. if you like aircraft and tanks in an Arcade/Realistic/Simulater enviroment then this is your game. there is much variety in vehicles you can choose to Fly/Drive which will keep you entertained for hours on end like my self xPalthough this game does have some major flaws for one the match maker for instance there are vehicles facing eachother in combat where they should not be eg. 8.0 BR (Battle Rating) meteor F mk3 verses a 9.0 BR MiG-17. One aircraft is capable of going over 1127km/h ie the MiG and the other rips its wings at just over 850km/h  obvious to most (except the developers) these two aircraft should not face eachother because of the major speed difference but they do. this is just one of many aircraft and tanks that have this problemalso not all vehicles perform up to their historical counterpart. a best part of 60% of vehicles are under performing and the rest are either just near it or are over performingonce these small problems above are worked out and are fixed this will be one bloody good game until then there are many other games that can give you an exact historical representation on aircraft and tanks this is not one of thembut its still bloody fun anyway!
great game for teamwork for when you are playing with friends in competition matches, great fast pace gameplay
