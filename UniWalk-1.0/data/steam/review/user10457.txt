The developers continue to set the bar on character and story driven gaming. The world is as incredible as always, the game still a joy to play. Nothing this year has come even close to the Witcher 3 + DLC
Reccommended? Maybe - really nice design and art style, good concepts but quite poorly executed. Some fundamental control and camera issues and decisions made early on can result in a very difficult time towards the end of the game (inability to level up or get perks). Hope they do better next time around....
Took me a while to get into it but a good engaging game with lots of alternative approaches to any given situation. Impressive effort and certainly worth a play if your into old school rpgs.
Great game, one of the few of late that is actually deserving of your time and is really fun to play. Nice to see it well optimised for the PC also.
One of the best games I have ever played. Not often games like this come along.
