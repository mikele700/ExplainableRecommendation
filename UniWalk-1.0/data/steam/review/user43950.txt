Circuits in it's basic form is a puzzle game, put the correct piece in the correct spot and see if everything looks right. However, what it does differently is every piece of the puzzle is a short piece of music, which you need to put into the correct position to recreate the whole score for the level. You might think this is quite simplistic, but if you are not a very musically driven person like me, it may be somewhat difficult to differ which piece goes where, due to some of them sounding very similar. The game slowly introduces different mechanics like layers, looping and switches, which increases the difficulty if you don't listen carefully.All in all this simplistic game is a very cheap gem on the steam store that forces you to listen to be able to solve the puzzle instead of staring and observing like many other games but can still be quite challenging and time consuming, although time is not wasted when you finally get to hear the masterpiece you put together.
