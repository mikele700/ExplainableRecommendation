Dishonored is a great game, and I would truly recommend it. The story is quite enthralling, (however not quite explained completely) and the amount you are able to achieve through this character is very good. The controls can be quite slow at some points, but overall, the controls have a good layout. The abilities you will gain over the period of this game is amazing, with each being necessary for any playthroughs you do. Which brings me to another point. The fact you have a control over the way you complete the game, allows you to have a sense of freedom moving through the multiple areas,whether you go big and loud or quiet and sneaky is completely up to you, as is the way you do that. In conclusion, Dishonored is a great single player game, with well thought out abilities, controls, gameplay, and a deep and somewhat dark storyline. The only cons are the slight lag in movements and that the game may get a bit repetitive if you get stuck at certain points, although, the changing in scenery mainly avoids this problem.Dishonored is truly a great game.
