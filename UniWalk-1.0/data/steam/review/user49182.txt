Only an hour into the game and a quite intense post apocalyptic experience. Quite the good purchase. Definitely better when bought in the metro franchise pack though.
Just like a normal fallout game ONLY COWBOY
Seriously I loved playing as an octopus disguised as a father, definitely enhanced the experience by 2. Nobody suspected a thing.
EVERYBODY HAVE FUN TONIGHT! Seriously though great game can last for ever if you play it right
