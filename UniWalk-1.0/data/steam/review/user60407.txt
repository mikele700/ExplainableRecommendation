I enjoyed this game a fair deal, although not much other then a try hard dayz if you like minecraft and dayz this is for you otherwise find something else.
Game wont even start.
It's like a dog, a dog you love very much, that one day starts to uncontrollably poo everywhere. You love that dog. That dog is your dog. You can't put the dog down. Therefore you live with the dog. Continue to play with the dog. Clean the dog and feed it. The dog is this game.
Best $10 i've ever spent.
Buggy as hell but pretty decent.
A great game with not just building highly volitile cars but with more mods than diseases on mexicans!10/10
I good game that has a lot of promise to it pulling in the player from his seat to a great land where all is possible for the young... dovahkin.
