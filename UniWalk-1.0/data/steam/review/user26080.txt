A good zombie style coop shooter that doesn't take itself too seriously but can still draw you into its world.
Good TV show adaptation and has that classic Paper Mario feel. It does drag out a little towards the end and some of the QTE's are death for your keyboad.If you like the show its worth a look.
You only have to watch video's from the pro's to know that this game can go from a FFA cluster ♥♥♥♥ to a Team Deathmatch where each precise shot is made to look like a form of art.
Though this is a great game, it feels more like a greatest hits rather than a remake or new game. It does feel a little shorter than the original game and can be completed rather quickly. So in some ways if you don't mind older graphics I'd say maybe check out Painkiller Black Edition first. But if you would rather something more up-to-date and have never played the series before, than it's worth a try.The gameplay is still great, killing hundreds of demons with a heavy metal soundtrack to keep you pumped.The voice acting and story are still typically B-Grade (though if you're playing this game for a deep emotionally driven story and brillant voice acting than kidding yourself).Basically if you're a CoD/ Battlefield fan you'll hate this, but if you love that 80's action hero style of Duke Nukem or Serious Sam this is the game to get.
