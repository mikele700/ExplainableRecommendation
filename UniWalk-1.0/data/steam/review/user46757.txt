This game it very weird,funny and extremly fun i have enjoyed every minute that i have played this game. the only thing that i do not like is that the campain is too short.
great fun a very diffrent but awesome it will keep you entertained for hours
This game is amazing highly recommend anyone that has played this on the consoles to get it on the pc because it is heaps better. it runs better, there are new gamemodes and many new things that make it heaps better!BUY IT!
i dont recomend this game at the moment because of alot of reasons i think you are better of waiting until it is out of early access.
One of the best games i have ever played! highly recomend it. I have completed the campain and i am still playing it.but a bit buggy at times.
I highly recomend this game if you love off-roading it is great fun and really addictive.
who ever likes motosport should get this game
