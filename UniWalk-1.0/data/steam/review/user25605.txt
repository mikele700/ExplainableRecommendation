I'm not sure what it is but it felt so rushed, so untied and not very well polished as a game. The mechanics were a bit... meh and the whole story was ♥♥♥♥♥! I wouldn't pay more than $20 for this... and I did!! Gross. Want my money back tbh...If you want to play a sneak game with an amazing gameplay and story played Dishonoured. Not this!
I love it!! :D
