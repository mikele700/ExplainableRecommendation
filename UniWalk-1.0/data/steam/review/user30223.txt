As someone who lives and breathes ID Software-'s formula and games since the very first iteration of DOOM back in 1993 this game is truly an amazing modernization of the franchise. Everything you could ever want and more. I solemnly believe that when I say that as the handful of people who complain and whine this ain-'t the original formula well then they should just go do just that and play the original 2 games.Legit it has everything to the core: gore, no reload, arena type areas, hordes of demons and now we have a ton of info on the story and background of DOOM and DOOMGUY, I-'m excited to play this over and over again along with Snap Map where I-'m sure a ton of people will create lots of cool retro or new level content.In summary: A lot of people are complaining about why the developers have done this and that but you all need to remember if Bethesda hadn-'t taken ID under their wing we wouldn-'t of had another DOOM game for a very, VERY long time. There are a ton of reasons that come to mind some that I-'m sure I can-'t come up with where the devs can and can-'t do with the game that won-'t sit well with the final draft, this is the best possible outcome. ID was struggling enough to re-create and win fans back into the franchise and as well appeal to a new audience into a game play style long forgotten as they had to scrap their first take on -DOOM 4- to start work on this so remember kids this is the long hard worked efforts of those who really wanted to bring back what we all loved and cherished back 20 years ago and they have done justice to the original titles.
