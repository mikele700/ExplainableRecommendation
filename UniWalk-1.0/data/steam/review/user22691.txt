Of all 3 of the orginal Stalker Games.. This one has just that something.. It may lack the some of the atmosphere of the first game, but it makes up for it with freedom. The faction wars, and your ability to face them in any manner you wish, is amazing.
These 3 games are the greatest things in history
I wake up in the morning about Six A.M.And play some TF2
