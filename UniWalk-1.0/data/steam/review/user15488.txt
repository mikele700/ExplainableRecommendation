great game. good cliche story. definitly reccomend it.
This game is amazing. Just did one play through and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Me and my friend are forever remembered in the stars and it is always there for me to check. It is lovely to see a game pursue the idea of every play through meaning something, but not have it possibly ruin your gameplay in the future.
Best Game on my games list. Thats 132 games people.
This game is very enjoyable. Get it i say :)
