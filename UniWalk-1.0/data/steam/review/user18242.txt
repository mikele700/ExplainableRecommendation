Seeing as I've put over 2 hours into this nightmare of a game, I find myself fit to describe how frustrating it is TO GET ANY SORT OF INS. I have replayed this game multiple times, especially chapter 4, trying to find an option which would advance the story past, 'I feel weird because of last year.' Destiny just didn't let me be happy, so I soon fell into depression because of how relatable this game is to my life. Thanks Kyle Seeley for making a Friend zone simulator...
This is a great game. Terraria and Minecraft are both left outside the starship while Starbound zooms off at light speed into new lands. Yes, I have played both Terraria and Minecraft, but I had never had so much with a game like Starbound. The characters are very relatable and quirky, and the new ideas put into this game are brilliant. Tutorials also actually tell you which is what and what is which. Even though I have only played a dozen or so hours, I already love Starbound. Even though this is a beta, it seems very well done.Starbound shall live on!!
