This game is one of the best FPS games around, you can customize your hats or play the game (only achivement idle servers) with other people (max on Valve servers 24, others, 32). Once you get good at TF2  will be able to trade with others for , weps, metal, hats and many more. This game has a lot of updates that make it feel fresh and new (End of the Line was -the best- update) for players who have been playing the game since 2007 (or later, cant remember when it came out). You could also get into comp, if you win you could get a medal (trust me its better than it sounds) or you could just not win and play other fun gamemodes like, surf (Boom Boom), MvM (FOR THE LOLZ), cp_hydro (what is that?) or just some Valve server (always a guy with hats on, i can never kill skrubs without being sniped). So there you have it one of the best (plz keep updating), most fun (unless you get rekt), FPS balenced (Disable Team Balance) games.P.S - Dont play pyro in Mann Up MvM with zero tours (you will get kicked)
