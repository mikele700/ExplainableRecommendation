So First up some specs so you cant claim I am running on a poor PCi7 1790kGTX 980ti32GB DDR3 RAM The game wont even Launch for me, Insta crashes after clicking play from the launcher and a lot of reports of random crashes too. buy at your own risk, If there isnt a patch in 24 hours fixing it I will be Requesting a Refund
After playing for a few hours, i have enjoyed the limited ammout of combat i have been allowed. So far the quest line is just doing small, meaningless jobs for people such as collecting wood or delivering lunch to some bloke. I really hope the gameplay improves with some more time because so far it has been pretty boring
So far, this game has amazing potential so far, and even though it is still an ALPHA game, has few gliches and it hasn't yet crashed. However it is in desperate need of a save feature ASAP. Its a bit anoying when you spend a long time building an awesome fort, just to lose it when you have to be taken away from the game. I also like the graphics setting for laptops, not that i will use it I like the effort put in to have it run on lower end systems. The only major issue is the motion blur. Even set to low it is WAY over the top. That needs fixing. Other then that rhis is a great game and i recomend it to any player of survival games.
