I will preface this review by stating that this is not a bad game. It is NOT a bad game. In fact, this game is amazing, and if you have never played Heroes before this game is my suggestion as to where you should start the journey. The reason for my down vote is simply because I paid $17 for nostalgia and that's pretty much it. Granted the graphics are better, but they weren't ever truly terrible for what the game was, and I feel overall not much else was done for it. It does not include all content which only adds to further disappointment and unless you're playing against people of your skill level, multiplayer is a joke (if it even works). The only solution I can see to correct this problem is to release the other 50% of the game (yes, the additional content accounted for pretty much 50% of the game) for free to those who have currently purchased the game and to add the random map generation.Whilst I still enjoy playing the game it's disappointing to know how unfinished this rerelease is, especially when it is an obvious cash-grab rereleasing a game for today's desktops.
