Like Swords? Like Bows? Like sandwiches? Like LOTS of wepons? Like lots of chacters to unlock? Got battle block thether?If you do you get cool stuff. Well thats the basics you go on the main quest play funny minigames with friends and see funny things. I really like the game and recomend it to anyone that likes a co-op, adventure, knight/creature game.
Great Game
