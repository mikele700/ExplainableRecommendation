War thunder is a great game when you feel like blowing s**t up or when you feel like playing a World War shoot 'em up. I've been playing this game for quite a while now (mostly without steam) and i can easily name the pros and cons of this game.Pros:  -Great Gameplay  -Great Graphics  -Lots of Planes to unlock  -In-Depth researchCons:  -Lots of Grinding  -The Matchmaking can be f***ed up sometimes
This is a great game for people who like action packed. After a while it can get a bit repetitive. This game is actually quite hard and that's probably one of the main reasons i play it. i'd rate it 8/10PS- played a level, mini boss appeared, got pwned 10/10 would get pwned again LoL
