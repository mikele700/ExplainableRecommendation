Before you even think about spending any money, check the update history. Or check the forums on the website. The game is no longer in development and you are just throwing your money away. This was a fun game, though was / is flooded with microtransactions (that aren't so micro). So play until you hit level 5 (or whatever level cap they introduced to bleed the last drops of money before the game was discarded by Ubi) and then uninstall. If you really want to throw money away, go feed it to some ducks or something.
