Awesome! Such a beautiful survival game :) but I now have a fear of the ocean :P
was loving it but it crashed!?
I love this game so hard...
I really loved this game, I felt connected to the characters and the banter they threw back and fourth but finished it within 6 hours which was disapointing. I want more. Game was too short for the price.
Awesome Game!
