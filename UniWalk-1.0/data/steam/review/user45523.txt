It works fine.That is until you find an ammo crate full of hats, a nearby truck full of hats, a locker with a gun you can't pick up, 5 hackers gunning you down from across the map, and a rifle with no bullets.On the up-side, uninstalling it works perfectly.
Here's a video I did on it:https://youtu.be/8713Tjh4KfU?list=PLYoRcETHLyMUs5Xdpu5jusjWyykQhm7D_I like it; overall gameplay elements like luck and ability cards add to the standard turn-based strategy elements of the game. The 'essential character' makes every situation a do-or-die situation since I just started again with the 'Ironman' modifier on.Story-wise it's repetitive, although most games like this (X-Com for example) suffer from repitition- then again, what game doesn't? To break that up, you've got prospecting, mini-stories, a whole range of things going - but that can be a little distracting.
*BEFORE YOU CONTINUE*I've been in Games Dev for a while now, so everything in this review comes from an industry-grade perspective. I'll try to be as objective as I can, so you can decide for yourself whether or not it's worth it.If a classic top-down RPG is your goal, by all means, get this. It has all you need to get started - the default build even comes with a main AND pause menu!So, let's play pros and cons:Pros:- Simple to navigate UI- A LOT of pre made stuff to make prototyping quickly- Documentation for the programmers- Reasonable price (when I bought it)- People make stuff for this game in Workshop- Some cool stuff in the workshopCons:- It's easy to tell when someone has made a game with this program- Most of the community made graphics conform to the grid of RPG Maker - making most of the stuff look 'generic'- Want to make a turn-based strategy? Best you find something else.- learnerFirendly = preMadeCode ? No : Yes (programmers will understand this); - Documentation isn't as in-depth as some of the meatier engines out there- People make stuff for this game in Workshop- Pre-made events make it easier, but what if you wanted to make a game in a different engine?TL;DRGood for top-down RPGs, not so much for other games - but not impossible
**This is subject to change as updates come through**Forsaken Fortress Strategy; where do I start?It's still in EA, so I'll go easy on it, but for the kind of genre it's going into, I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down. Sorry Photon Arena, but that's how it is. Here's why:Pros:- Interesting survivor mechanics- Solid design and most things have a logical flow to them- Diverse enough game modes (unlike most other games of this type)Cons:- No tutorial game mode (or tooltips in-game). Sorry community guide writers (you guys are awesome), but a game like this should have one by default- Help section doesn't actually help much; the descriptions are quite bare; and there's missing content- Building functionality essentials are 'missing'; by that I mean, they aren't in the help section- Neutral NPCs appear as enemies on the map- Very repetitive events- I can hear the zombies, but I can't see them...in the day time**If you're one of 'those' people (and I can understand why)**- Made in Unity 3D <--- Not a con in my books (even though I am a UE person)I'm not asking for someone to hold my hand here, but there is a difference between hand-holding, and giving players a handy-dandy, well-written reference.
I don't really remember how I got this game.I'm going to assume it was gifted to me...or maybe I got it cheap...maybe, I don't know.So, seeing as I miraculously own this game, I thought 'Ok, might as well try it out, huh?'. I like zombie games since I see them as a form of stress relief (teaching = high stress). But this adds to my stress levels - the exact opposite of what I wanted.Pros:It's a top-down shooter (Don't see too many of those nowadays)ZombiesSorta-kinda worksYou can uninstall it with no problemsCons:Too many to list down
