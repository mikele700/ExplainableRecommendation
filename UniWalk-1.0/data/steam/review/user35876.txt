A great mix of slow, tension building approaches and exciting gunplay. 10/10, my gmae of the year.
This game is really good. It puts you in place of a ruler and lets you build a civilisation from scratch. It's a great experiece and can even be educational.9/10 ps very addictive approach with caution
Very fun. Survival FPS with a horror twist. Great mod.
