Great game lots of fun, It is difficult at first but once you et the hang of it you're all set
Although a lot of people have had issues with this game, on my PC I had little to no bugs or crashes. The story and visuals are amazing and I highly recomend this game to a fan of the Arkham Games and even to people who have never played any of them. Overall I highly recomend this game as the storytelling is amazing and the gameplay and visuals are even better
Batman Arkam City, where do I begin this game has so much to offer. This game contains tons of collectables and things to explore. The story is emmersive and amazing I thourgholy enjoyed this game and recommend it to all.
This game is very fun and will keep you entertained for a long while as you figure out how to make the perfect games
Great game it is much better and entertain than the first Portal
A great game, apart from the very obvious ending if you have played the other two before the other games
Great game to use your imagination and let it run wild
