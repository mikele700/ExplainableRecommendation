Excellent game, the combat system is wide and varied, challenging but rarely frustrating, The enviroments are rich and well developed and a surprisingly rich plot with lots of character development which is lacking in a lot of other WRPGs. So refreshing to see a WRPG where the narrative is treated with as much care as the gameplay and enviroment. A guranteed crowd pleaser.
Best MMO I have played to date, and I have played quite a few, Guild Wars 1 & 2, World of Warcraft (Subbed) few others the were F2P but nothing has kept me in for 280hours. Actually there isn't a single game I have played that long, don't really know what it is but the combat is great, the powers are great and so are the instances. Even though the raids and alerts are always the same they are always fun to do, especially in a fun group. One downside is though that people always look for high CR players, literally if you're 1 below 99 or 100 they won't accept you into the group, the raids and alerts you can do but you wont be allowed to because of your lower Combat Rating.However if you manage to get into a good league you should be all set as they will have members that will be doing the raids with you and will want to help you out.
Batman's trip to the asylum has hardly any flaws. The controls fit perfectly and the missions will entertain you every second you play this game. Buy it, play it, love it.
