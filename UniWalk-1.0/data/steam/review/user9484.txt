Amazing storyline. This game will question your outlook on life. I dont think anyone could have predicted how well this game turned out.
Good game overall but it is only a tempory game. The problem isn't the amount of stuff n the game, it is that the game is basically over once you have a farm and water.
The Counter-Strike franchise has always been and will continue to be one of Steam's best franchises. I enjoy Global Offensive much more than Source and honestly the game is super addictive. I can't really go into detail of why I love it cause theres too much to talk about.9/10 Favourite Game on Steam currently
