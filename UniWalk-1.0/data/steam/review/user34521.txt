Don't Starve is one of the best games I have played, a great and fun game in both single and multi-player (DST). It does eventually get boring, but that is after one gets to day 200 (I play offline, so the hours don't record), but getting to that stage is immensely difficult, and the games cost is far less than the entertainment you will get playing it. Overall, buy it and play it, as you will likely enjoy it.
