Nice Game Ever
I tried not to cry.
Nice Doge. Wait...It's a pug.
This game makes my hand pains for click shift all the time.
I would say this is a great whatever people will say that OVERKILL are just a greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but well,some of dlc are not worth it buy it at your own risk.
If you got a probleme that bother just grab this game and chill out with virtual sea and environment of the beach!
Awesome Game
