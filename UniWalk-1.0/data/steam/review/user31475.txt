Although this game is only an hour or two long depending on how quickly you rush through it, I feel that Its been done so beautifuly and brought me back to Freebirds earlier game 'To the Moon', which still remains to be one of my favourite steam games. The music still gets me every time and from the start, I felt the feels start to hit me hard.
This is an extremely fun and light-hearted game.
