OMG so addicting and so good.
Awesome game so much fun
not to easy find a non custom game
Awesome very good because of its custom zombies that add so many customizations of weapons maps perks zombies and more
absolute trash
Fallout 4 is a must have for anyone who has played Fallout 3 or New vegas.The game has a new amazing crafting system with the guns, melee weapons and armor. Although there arent to many guns in the game.While writing this review i have around 30+ hours on the game and have finished the main story which in my opinion was pretty short. before going out and exploring i recommend doing a few main quests first and then start the exploring.
A pretty amazing game, the graphics are amazing and the atmosphere just makes my weiner grow more then 3 cm :D 10/10 3==D3=====D
Amazingly fun game. The online mode is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ though, really laggy and frames drop even when playing with my friend down the road from me.

Great game especially with friends but oceanic servers disappear off the list sometimes
