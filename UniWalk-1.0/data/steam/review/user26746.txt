Although many many people have been having game breaking problems with this game, I have not and I can honestly say that this is the best game in the series for what I have played so far. The gameplay is pure batman fun and the story is one of those mystery within a mystery that I especially love. Although I have experienced SOME frame drops during the game, it's usually when I'm in the batmobile and crashing through a bunch of stuff and making lots of debris. I have had some other odd frame drops but they only last half a second and aren't game breaking.Here are my pc specs if you are on the fence about if you can run the game:CPU: AMD FX-8350 GPU: Gigabyte Geforce GTX 970 G1 GamingRAM: 16gbOS: Windows 7 Home premium 64bitI seriously recommend you play this game if you are a fan of the series, maybe wait till the bug fixing patch comes out or play it on a XBONE or PS4 but this game is seriously good.
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings..... WOW, This game is like the Lord of the Rings game I've always wanted. The way the story flows and how the RPG elements mix in with the action of third person slashing and magic using is amazing! I surely can't wait till The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt comes out, if it is improved in any way from this game, it will be amazing!
