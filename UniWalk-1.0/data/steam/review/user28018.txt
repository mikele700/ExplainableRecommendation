Just bought this game a couple days ago, after what I've seen, here's what I have to say,PROS:-Nice graphics that still hold up today in my eyes-Nice radio stations with good music-The immersion is fantastic, Liberty City feels alive, it really does feel like a smaller version of NYC-The driving engine is rad, it feels nice with each car having its own feel and weight to it-Fantastic characters, they all feel like real people, none of them are stereotypicalCONS:-No motorcycles (but this doesn't really matter because this was the first 3D GTA game)-Our main character Claude does not say a single word, this leaves SO much room for character development, not even in GTA SA does Claude say word (but it does tell us he owned a service station in San Fierro and he used to live in San Andreas and ran away to Liberty City wiht Catalina)-The car's damage, it seems like they can be up in flames within seconds-getting out of a vehicle on it's side, sometimes i am still stuck in the vehicle (vans and trucks), the vehicle sets ablaze and Claude is stuck -If you buy this on steam you will see that all the cars are dark, I had to download a different .exe filethat's about it though a part from some annoyances I love the game! 7.5/10
this game does not give you enough tools to do anything, it's just an uninspired minecraft zombie survival
NOW THIS is how you do a retro game, tight controls and a hard but fun challenge
