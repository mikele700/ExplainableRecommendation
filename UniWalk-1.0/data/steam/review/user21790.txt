Saint-'s Row IV is definetly one of the better games I-'ve played; with witty and comedic dialogue, various missions, and lots of activities and fun objectives packed into this game. I must say, the super-powerd gameplay is also extremely fun to use and is a welcome change to the franchise in my opinion. As well as all the fun packed into this game, there are SO many refrences and easter eggs, and parodies in the story and the side quests. This game also includes co-op, which when played with friends, is always a fun time. All the weapons and vehicles are unique, making them fun to use and customize.The map however, is sometimes bland and plain but when you are busy speeding and gliding around the city, it doesn-'t matter much. Now, the customization. Character cuztomization is EXTREMELY detailed with so many options to make you boss truly yours and have fun with. The weapon customization is a nice touch given that they are already so fun to use. Weapon customization also allows you to change the way it looks, the stlye it shoots, and sound effects too.The game-'s graphics are just fine if you don-'t really care about it and it looks good enough for me. The game can also run on a low-spec pc which was good news to me because my pc runs games like crap and sometimes games are buggy but luckily, it runs fine for me and should run well for you too.So, given the fact that I-'ve already completed gives me a right to say how amazing and fun it is. I-'m very excited for the newest installation to the series: Gat Out Of Hell which is another standalone action packe super powered Saint-'s Row I am ver excited for.Overall, I give it a 10/10 In my opinion based on my experience.A video review of Saint-'s Row IV will be up on my channell -Dat Wolf- very soon.Go check it out later and Maybe Subscribe! :DThanks for reading!
