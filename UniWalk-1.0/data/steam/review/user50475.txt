Definitely one of my all time favourite games, don't pay attention to my short play time as i first had it on my ps3 and pretty much did everything there was to do in it and have recently bought it on steam, along with all the new dlc and addons. I'd first like to say that even though the game looks a bit cartoony and odd, as soon as I started playing I fell in love with the cartoon look and style of the game. There are hours upon hours of hilarious and engaging content with more exciting adventures to be had with each new dlc that 2k games releases. As you progress through the game you earn skill points which go towards your character's strengths and abilities that can be changed to suit the way you play the game. If you liked the original Borderlands you'll love this and even if you did not, BL2 has a heap of improvements.There are (now) 6 different protaganists to choose from which can create a whole new aspect to the game and completely changes the way you play the game. With a fulfilling main quest, and an almost endless amount of sidequests and minigames, Borderlands 2 will leave you begging for more time to play.
This game is just pure fun.So many things that you and your car can do, so many custom maps and cars, the music adds to the feel of the game and creates the chill atmosphere.Graphics are sweet as and the adventure mode level design is perfect.tl:dr 8/8 would bang.
