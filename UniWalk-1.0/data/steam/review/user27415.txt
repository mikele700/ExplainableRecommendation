Took me a while to actually get the hang of it (mostly from lack of trying), but now I actually really enjoy this game!Definately worth adding to your Steam Library
Seriously one of the best games I have bought, non-repetitive and great co-op.. Just like any other Unreal Engine run game it is very fun and addictive to play
