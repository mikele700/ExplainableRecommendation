At first when I played this game I had an immediate flurry of thoughts relating the game to Call of Duty 6, but soon as I grew into and adapted to the games mechanics, I found myself appreciating the game a lot more as there have been glorious updates and reworks to maps I used to play in Cs: Source. Fun game, addictive, reward systems are good, buy/trade market is appropriate and overall solid game. Definantly worth a buy.
Easy to play blockade game, runs smoothely in game and servers aren't overly laggy. Having more than one game mode is excellent making this game rather entertainable. This game at alpha is already 10/10 GIVE ME MOAR!!
