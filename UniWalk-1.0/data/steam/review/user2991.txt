Wow! This game has serious potential! DayZ has to be one of the best games I have ever played. DayZ has the simple concept of surviving. You are dumped into a post apocalyptic world infested with zombies. This may sound simple, however, it is something that I just love. The DayZ worlds (yes there has been several different worlds created for DayZ) are just beautiful. They are massive and have an eerie stillness to it that makes you so immersed into the gameplay, thinking that you are actually in a zombie inhabited world fighting for survival. The fact of being in a world with other real players is amazing. Think this to yourself: how will you interact with them? Other players makes surviving a lot harder. This is the true difficulty of the game. What makes this game really interesting is that it is your choice. You choose what to do. You can choose to help people or kill everyone you meet. Ofcourse, with the game being in alpha, the are heaps of glitches... heaps. Zombies can attack you though walls, your cars can flip and shopping marts can be filled with floating loot! These are only some of the glitches to name. But these downsides hardly affect the game. Once you play it, you will understand.  DayZ is very versatile. Many mods for this mod have already been created which are great to suit your own playing style. If you like trading and building bases, DayZ Epoch is for you. If you like your game to be more difficult, DayZ 2017 will suit you. I really like DayZ. Hopefully these glitches and other faults will be fixed as it can make the game discouraging to play. This game is already a big hit now, and what awaits for it in the future is going to be grand. DayZ has yet to be one of the best games ever.
