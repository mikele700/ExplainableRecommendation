Ok so first time playing and i kill mom i'm just to good i guess.......
I don't own this game why can I review................................................................................
Used a radioactive rod as staff and started taking damage10/10 would kill myself again.
I don't know how i got so into this but yeah i got over the top about it...... ehh its not the best but for a free to play game its pretty fun.
0.8 hours in and i see bear ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ him self.10/10 would watch bear ♥♥♥♥ again!Just saying buy this game and watch Gaben wipe his ♥♥♥ with your money we all want that.
If people haven't played this buy it now and for people who have bought it never played it who are you?
If you haven't played this game yet go buy it right now. Its like the best dungeon crawler ♥♥♥♥ up the carrots simulator of 2014.
