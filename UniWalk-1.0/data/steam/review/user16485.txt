i thought to myself ♥♥♥♥ ye lets fix greece a super power year later broke and turkey pulling down my pants 10/10 would go broke again
this game is a good game it's fun and all but the COMMUNITY oh god the community it's just so bad. if your new or do ONE just ONE little thing wrong out comes the hate ray and fires it all over the place BAM NOOB BAM UNINSTALL BAM KILLYOURSHELF. i try to like the game only because it's fun and thats with friends. if  you dont have friends who play this game dont get it if you have a freidn who is good at this game sure play with him have the time of your life but dont play without friends if your new. yes some people will be nice tell you what your doing wrong but thats the same chance as unboxing something good and then they leave and your stuck with everyone else.

♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME GOT BANNED CAUSE TWO OF MY TEAM WANTED TO DE RANK SO THEY RAN INTO ME WHEN EVER I SHOT.......
well i started my life in a humble little town. i looted and was doing my own thing till i fell off a lader and broke my legs... soon i had  a friend come and shoot me. then spent the next hour trying to found one another. after that we found an air field and looted like crazy. then i was put in charg of finding our way back to the beach. i had no clue XD but i got us their!!. then we found some new guys handcuffed them and drained them of 90% of their blood and from that day  on me and my friends patrol the roads looking for people to -Donate some blood-. when draining people of blood gets boring we make a cripple army and leave them to kill one another. dayz do what you want kill who you want drain who you want but get killed by the ladders DONT TRUST LADDER THEY ARE DEATH ON A WALL
