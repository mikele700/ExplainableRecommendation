This game is rather unique.It is brutal and it is scary at times.If you have ever thought that you'd be a survivour in the Z apocalypse? Play this game and see how long you will live. This game tests you and at points it comes down to luck. If you like survival games or Z apocalypse games? Play this game, get it, support it, love it. The only negative I have for this game is the lack of possible Co-op multiplayer. It is really difficult to set this up and there are limited AU servers as well, making it difficult to play with friends currently. Buy this game, and support it.
