Played a few hours. It's not bad.
Hackers abundant. Despite this however it is a stellar game with almost limitless potenial. THE most polished Alpha i've ever had the pleasure of playing, this game is only going to get better. Goty 201X mark my words.
This is the definitive Dark Souls II Edition. Basically, it-'s -Prepare to Die-, but for Dark Souls II . . .except better!Seriously. If you-'re on the fence? Get it.
