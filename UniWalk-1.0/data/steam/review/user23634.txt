great game played it a couple of times at friends houses. but i've only got mac computers at home. Hoping they release a mac version soon, been waiting for two years now. personally i would recommend it to others, its good fun to create your own innovative space stations and ships. i've been watching all the new content be released, such as the planets and spiders (npc's). getting jealous now. Thanks.
