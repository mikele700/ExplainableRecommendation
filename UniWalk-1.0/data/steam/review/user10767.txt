This game made a huge impact on my life when i was a kid and made me love action games like i play today. I remember as a child i would constantly get up to beat bloody palace mode, this game would never get old due to it's intense gameplay!
It's been a while since i added a game to one of my favorite games of all time, but this game, THIS GAME! It may be dark and scary but IT'S SO AWESOME, im buying the soundtrack too cause the music is so awesome and i want to support this guy!HAIL TOBY FOX!
