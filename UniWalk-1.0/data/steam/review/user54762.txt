Woops GTA V's ♥♥♥, you should get Just Cause 2, then get this AMAZING mulitplayer mod. I have played approx. 54 hours of JC2, and it is totally amazing. I have lots of new online friends now, and most of them are the Developers - Philphax and Trix and Woet!!! They are the best online game developers that I have seen in quite a while, so if you have JC2, and are considering getting this mod, GET IT IMMEDIATELY.
If you dont have it, you have to get it because it is AMAZING!!!!
