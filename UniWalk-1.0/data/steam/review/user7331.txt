Payday 2 is easily one of the best multiplayer experiences I ever had. I wouldn't call it the most polished game, considering the single player aspect of it isn't the best, due to the friendly AI's inablility to do much, except shoot and move around. With friends or without, multiplayer gameplay is insanely addictive and amusing. However, stealth is a bit finicky, bugs are quite rampant, and the community can be quite undesirable.
As a God Eater Burst (PSP) and God Eater 2 (JP PSP) player, I have to say that this PC port is actually really solid albeit the wonky keyboard controls. I strongly suggest you play this game with a controller for the FULL AUTHENTIC BUTTON MASHING EXPERIENCE.2 lazy 4 full reviewI rate this game a solid 5/7 (hehe lol) 10/10
