Terraria is a splendid mix of fantasy, sand-box, adventure and a whole lot more. You’re guaranteed to find yourself immersed in this creative RPG with everything from wood cutting to build your first shack to complex electronics and then to fighting off an old man possessed with a giant skeleton demon. I’m an maliciously hard of a judge to please but even I have to give this a 10/10.
