Story's quite simple, i would expect more dlc or future updates and see where does it bring the characters.Get caught in a sticky situation and you're kinda in hot soup for the rest of the mission. Even if one manages to salvage and escape, the missions will only get harder and harder. Rate is a 8/10 , due to my favoritism in the strategic genre. Taken 2 off because of the story, i wished there was more to this whole game.
