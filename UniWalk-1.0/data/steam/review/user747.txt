Unlike its new sequel; Dark Souls 3, DS2 has done something that completely astounds players to this very day, something that made the game what it was. Around the launch of DS3 i would spend hours watching PvP, reviews and lore videos while i was saving for the game. One faithful day i stumbled across a review that changed my entire perspective on it, something so terrible i could not bare to spend a single dollar on that embarrasment that is DS3. The review simply stated some broken and missing mechanics that of which are alive and well in DS2. What are these key mechanics you may ask? To put it simply in a complete and utter overlook on fromsofts behalf, they managed to leave out the single thing that made DS2 so superior, so excellent. That mechanic my friend is Common Fruit.9/10 Hopefully FromSoft redeems themselves by readding Common Fruit in their new DLC and then maybe i will purchase DS3.
THE THERMAL DRILL, GO GET IT!
