Legitimately better than Watch Dogs...
I would be more angry about not even being able to start this game if it were not for the fact that I paid for it using csgo items. But however I later found out that without playing this game from your C: drive It wont work. Kinda a problem when you only use a 120gb ssd as your boot drive :| Oh well I guess even when ubisoft makes a great game ( And it is if you can get around the issues) They still ♥♥♥♥ it up for me somehow.
