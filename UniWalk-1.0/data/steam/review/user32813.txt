NEVER EVER DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!!!Looked really good in my opinion, downloaded it and thought -wow this is cool as--30 mins later- found 1 deer after walking around for 30 mins-20 mins later- the deer ran away and i cant even find it again because it ran really far after i was around 600 metres away from it-10 mins later- I quit the game because i couldnt find any animals besides the 1 deer that took 30 mins to find.so basically all you do is walk around really slowly ( even the running is slow ) and all you do is look for animals around a decently big map which takes ages to walk around just to find 1 animal...... dont waste your internet getting this because you will get bored of it really fast........................................3 words---disapointment---boring---wasteThis game could be good if they added some things in-cars-MORE ANIMALS-free multiplayer-and got rid of the animals bloody hearing distance!! they hear you when your like 4-600 metres away!!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY!
This game is just so amaz..TERRIBLE! Wasted my parents money on this game and regret buying it because of how bad the gameplay is... missions never change and nothing is good about this game :DChou-CryPtiCe
SO, ive played 324 hours and still love this game, this is by far my favourite game i have played on Steam and my first Survival Game..my friends mostly hate this game but i am VERY addicted to this and cant stay off it, so much to do, so much fun :D
So.. I bought this game because my friends explained to me how amazing it was and how it would be enjoyable and worth my money.....I have a slight feeling my friend was trying to -troll- me considering how absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game actually is...Waste of money! ♥♥♥♥ gameplay! Overall just crap.-CryPticE
