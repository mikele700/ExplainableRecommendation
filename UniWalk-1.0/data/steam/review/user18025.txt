First of all, Great game Bethesda! Been hyped sinced I first saw FO4's trailers and teasers on youtube. Instantly made me want to buy the game, even though I was still playing FO3. For me, I don't really care about the bugs and the glitches of the game, it's what makes the game fun and hilarious honestly. And if an NPC has gone missing? Fire up the console commands, thats how I do it. Setting aside the bugs and glitches comes the one thing that bothers me the most, not the loading screens, not the requirements, but the decisions the lone wanderer makes. It feels like whatever you say, has the same outcome. But not in every case though. Other than that, everything is amazing. The graphics (even on low), the gameplay, the weapons, and even Dogmeat's AI is better. And I like how you guys made the companions immortal or something, it kinda release the stress in me. I like how you guys tweaked with the perk chart, really makes me think where to spend my precious point. Amazing game Bethesda, please keep on creating amazing games like Skyrim and Fallout.
Very Nice Game! Alot of things to explore, discover and Play with! When I started playing this game, I felt the hype in me. I really recommend this game to other players who likes to adventure and discover new things in the game! 10/10 Haven't confronted any glitches and bugs YET! Simply Perfect, well made, and amazing!
