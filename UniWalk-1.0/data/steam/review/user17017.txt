C&C Kanes Wrath is a fast paced RTS game by itself, but what makes it great is its ability to incorporate diversity into each of the three races, allowing for sub fractions that have unique units and abilites, while at the same time removing certain units and structures from the whole race techtree, ie, play as Scrin you get a wide range of units, but play as the Reaper69, you loose the aireal portion of the techtree while gaining access to knew and deadlier ground forces. So, overral, I'm rating this C&C 7.5/10, because in comparision to other RTS games (Grey goo, Warhammer, etc) It just isn't that in-depth as the other games of its type. 100% Reccomended.
Very good RTS game. Gripping & interesting storyline, the selection of alien races (Including human) is diverse to a point, and with that, it brings the fun of strategery to a whole new era.
Waste of space for the following reasons:One: being it lacks what other zombie apocalypse survival games have, attention to detail and depth. Better off playing one of the zombie survival ones from the Dead Island series, Resident Evil etc.Two: Its free for a reason.3/10. Not reccomended whatsoever.
