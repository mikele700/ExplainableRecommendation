This game. Let me start off by saying I have never reviewed a game before but feel I should in this case.  I was suspicious as soon as I read all the negative reviews but thought hey I'll give it a shot. I like CS, I like Zombies, I should like this too. What this game boils down to after playing a couple matches it bascally this. Spawn in with the Negev (or equivalent machine gun), completely ignore all other weapons and I mean ALL, SMGs, Shotguns, other pistols, useless. Then proceed to midlessly hold left left click and sway the mouse from side to side. Solved. Either that or get completely overun by the insane amounts of idential zombies. Thats it. It is a very boring, repeditive game and thats all is all. I fell that maybe if this game has more modern elements (graphics, gore system, decent models etc) this game could be more fun but as is the game runs off a decade old system (CS:CZ) and it really shows. I know its free and all but it seriouslly doesn't even warrent the Download space to get it.TL;DR Not a big download and its free but it really isnt worth your time.
