-left 6 long, easy right into finish- hands down best rally game. At this point in time it can only get even better! 10/10 would go over crest into medium right again
Really happy with the game so far. The AI put up a good challenge, I'm having some real battles. Physics are fantastic as long as you have them on pro, watch any replay after a race and the movements look spot on. Get a few upgrades on the bike and it brakes and controls alot better too. Whip controls and physics are a little bit odd but an improvment over the previous MXGP. Nice graphics too, love taking screenshots in replays. The most complete Motorcross game available. progressive career, lots of bike upgrades and gear options. I have played EVERY motorcross game since excitebike on nintendo. This is a solid MX game 8/10
top down WAR!
Can sell chicken eggs and corn to buy tractors. 10/10
All the tiny peoples! such detail, WOW  10/10
