As fun as this game Looks,Its all a Big Microtransaction festIt requires you to buy money or spend Hours,And Hours Breaking blocks to get atleast 10 Coins. Or you can take the Paying approach and Spend Tons of money on this gameThis game is not Right for steam, If i choose 1 Option and screw up,BAM!,The game broke!,You Dun goofed!,You can't see the Entire screen!This is more of a Phone game (If it is,I don't care). It doesn't need steamThis is my opinon by the way, So don't be hatin
Fun game,Even if you are new,Its funWill be writing Combat Strategies here
