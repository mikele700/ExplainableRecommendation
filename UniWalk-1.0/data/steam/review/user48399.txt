This is the most magnificent $3 game I've ever played. I don't care that it only takes 25 minutes to 100% the game. The art style is awesome, the music is relaxing, and overall the game is well worth the spare change to buy it.
The only game I know where I felt happy to beat the first level in 51 minutes.59.99/10 would -Game over. Again.-
