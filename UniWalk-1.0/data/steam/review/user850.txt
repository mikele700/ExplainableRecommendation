This is the type of game that has alot of playing styles. For example stealth and Action, choose to level your character with stealth abillities or more action oriented abillities. Definitely one of the best actions games ive played so far considering how old it is as well. the game also has a great story line! and the side quest that come with the game is also worth doing!10/10 - RECOMMEND
Story is pretty good at the start but expect dissappointment at the end of the game! fighting combat is similar to Batman arkham asylum and city. where as the overall gameplay is much like assassins creed, however its not a bad thing because the game does offer upgrades on skills and weaponary so the flow of combat is not always the same. The stealth is way to easy aswell like orcs are just way too stupid and the attract button makes the game way to easy.  The nemesis system is good either having like your own army withing the system or let the orcs fight themselves within the system and see how they progress within the army. Final verdict its alot of fun! messing around with the orcs the brutal final blow kills are brutal! and having to choose to stealth or run in like a maniac always keeps the game fun and entertaining i was just dissapointed with the story of the game.
