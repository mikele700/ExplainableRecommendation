Best game I have ever played and a thousand times even better when you download mods
3 years I've played this game and although that doesn't seem as much as a lot of people due to the fact that this game is one of the oldest on Steam people questioned me why I played it and some even made fun of me for it. The TF2 community might be at the lowest yet with the new Tough Break update but still even if the biggest people in TF2 such as Jerma985 and Star_ are sick of it I am not it just shows how much this game has dragged me back to it even if I rejected to,eventually I would return and play because I know I want to most my friends that I played TF2 with I barely even see play it but I don't care this game is one of the most special games I've ever played and it was one of the very first games that I've actually stuck around on others I got bored of after getting sick and tired of their repetitive style but still for some reason this game is the only one where I won't stop even if I want to.I'll get to the point of it now I absolutely LOVE and I mean LOVE this game no matter what people tell me about how it isn't as competetive as CS:GO or it is stupid because of how they're always hats on people's heads this game is different from your normal FPS games you actually have to work as a team well to win the game not just run around and shoot people its classes are all balanced and don't handle like COD,Battlefield or CS:GO which shows how different it is so why not give it a try if I and many can enjoy it shows no reason why you can't go download TF2 now and I mean NOW Mr.
I do hate the fact that I lagged a ton in this game really a shame but other than that this game is GTA online for free and less people and also you can play as cops and....... Well I'm gonna shut up now
