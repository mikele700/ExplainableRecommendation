Who knew that a game that classified as an Open World Space Sim could be scarier than all of the FNAF games combined...Anyway onto the story, after many legal trading missions (with low reward) I decided to do, just one, illegal mission. It was to take 4 slaves to the neibouring system. Easy enough. The first halve was simple as I flew close to full speed out of the station and jumped into hyper-space. -How hard could it be?- i thought to myself...Out of hyper-space and heading to the starport. Then out of the corner of my eye I see a direct message from a Federation Navy Ship telling me that I was a suspect and will intredict me. At that point my heart was already in my mouth and the other ship about to pull me out of supercruise. I finally pulled myself together, and managed to line up with the escape vector. Still in supercruise and the Navy Ship is still after me, the interdiction was easier this time - the Navy Ship left me alone.Untill an -'enemy-' tried to intredict me and succeeded. I thought I was as dead as the companion cube in Portal. But somehow he didn-'t want to fight this -newbie- and left me alone. The rest was a breese as I docked the ship and spammed the Starport Services button to recived my pay.13/12 Would get this lucky again.
Great game for...Well just fun!
