Built 1 nuke and nuked my enemy when he dident have na anti nuke.enemy went and nuked me because i did not have one10/10 would get nuked again.
nothing to say. -buy this game-
needs multiplayer.needs co op as least.needs ship buildingneeds proper Recource managment.needs multiplayerdid i mention it has no multiplayer> ohh yes i did.
I have not played Any past tropico games but i have been enjoying tropico 5 with its good graphics and exellent gameplay, i Really enjoyed the multiplayer that i think works Very Well and has Alot of balance.
good game if you like making the virtual money :Dgood mod support and good gameplay make for a fun game.only con i found was that having very large rooms with lots of servers made the game run ALOT slower. though you dont do this much.
