My older review was '10/10 would bread again.', but i take that back. 2/10 you removed any playability for people with older computers. You've removed the graphics options, thus making it impossible for me and others to play, the tutorial does't work, my game crashes all of the time. I have a new-ish PC, but because i'm almose broke, i have an old graphics card. It works fine with everything else, but with one of my (used to be) favourite games, you, Bossa Studios, had to sacrifice that.Pros--Fun Game-Enjoyable-Good in Early Access-Fun conceptCons--Unplayable for some people-Crashing due to to high of a SET graphics quality-Very low frame rateOverall, I do reccomend this game, BUT don't buy it if you have a less-powerful PC. (These are my opnions, so don't pull me apart like the vultures you are.)
