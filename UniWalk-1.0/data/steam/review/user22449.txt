Addicting and fun, $5 for the game really is a good price.
Feelsbadman killing toriel by accident ;-;, best rpg that i've ever played and actually wanted to play through the different endings.
This is another good VN by KEY, recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the sad story and feels made by KEY. Worth the $10 i spent on this, the memories of this being my very first VN will not be forgotten
