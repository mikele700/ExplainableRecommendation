This game, where to start. For a text adventure, creative theme and storyline. Easy to start, hard to finish. All the choices that can be made leading on to different events is really cool. This is one of the most consistantly frustrating games i've ever played.  That said, it really pulled me into playing it more. Had a great time playing and completing it.
