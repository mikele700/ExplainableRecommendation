Garry's mod (or Gmod) is a sand box game right...? your wrong I know everybody has seen the sandboxy side of Gmod but people are making maps and gamemodes that change the game for example there is a game called stop it slender which is a multiplayer slenderman game where the surviors must collect 8 pages but one person can play as slenderman and needs to kill the surviors Gmod is a game of all generes from Fighting FPS to sandbox game I recommend this game to anybody
