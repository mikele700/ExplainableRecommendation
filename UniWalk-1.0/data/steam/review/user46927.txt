In super hexagon, you play as a small character known as point, along with another character known as hexagon. In this game you battle through endless waves of lines, colours, and truly awesome music. Use your skills to defeat your enemies such as line, triangle, square and pentagon, and battle to survive these shapes to get past the 60 second mark, allowing you to defeat each level. If you play this game, you will love it, hate it, and be extremely competitive over it, which is why it is so fascinating and rage inducing to play and watch. But, none the less, it is still a great video game that deserves a spot in your steam library, and like myself, might become one of you favorite games.I, Apricoat, supreme overlord of cheesecake, give this game a score of 8.25/10
