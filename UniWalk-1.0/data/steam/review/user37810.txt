Don't be deceived by the marketing for this game. This is not your typically shooter.To be honest, Spec Ops: The Line is not a great Third Person Shooter mechanically, but that doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable. It's just simple, in the way any TPS is.It can be frustrating during parts, but if you get past that, it's a great experience. You'll really want to play through this game atleast once for the story. The narrative makes some great statements on games in general, and how they glorify war and violence. It's not perfect, but it's admirable that a developer would take such a risk in storytelling in any case. It's worth supporting this game, at the very least for this.In general, it's a great PC Port, with only minor stuttering at times. Key rebinding is dodgy though. Definitely a console port.
