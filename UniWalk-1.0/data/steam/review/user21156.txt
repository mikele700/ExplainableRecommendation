Previously I would get annoyed with this game when it didn't spawn chests that had items that i needed and would require me to start a new world, look for chests and bring the items back to the origional world if I found them, this left me feeling like a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥, but thankfully they added the fishing mechanic and this allows you to fish for items that you previously would only find in chests. This has removed the neccesity of me feeling like a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥ and for that I am grateful.
