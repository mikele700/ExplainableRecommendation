Pros:Epic couch multiplayerEditor and steam workshop is a nice touch (Dark World)Co-Op is as good as the versus multiplayer which I personally dont see often in versus multiplayer oriented gamesSituations of pure *skill*Epic Arrow catching mechanicsResponsive controlsLots of trashtalkLots of variables that can be played with other things i have forgotten to mentionCons:Only local multiplayer (although I personally think local is where this game is best, a multiplayer mode would be nice)Maps can be a little small at times, especially when playing 4-manTo Note:Once you start to get bored of the original levels I really recommend buying the DLC as it adds a fresh new take with tons of user created levels to entertain you once more! You can even try your own hand a putting together a level for your friends.
