Crashes more times than female V8 drivers...no but seriously though awesome game, buy it.
fun little space strategy game, well worth the price.has three different campains each will take about 45 mins-1 hour to complete.also has skirmish mode. which is fun and challenging.can upgrade your different ships and weaponary.can vs your friends in multiplayer and can also vs randoms in multiplayer public matches.
excellent game, must have for any horror fans. 10/10pros + great story.+ good graphics.+ interesting characters, good voice acting.+ excellent level design.+ very scary.+ immersive.+ cheap price.cons - not a very long game 4-5 hours if you run through 6-7 if your slower. hands down best horror game i have played easily worth the 10$ (go ahead and buy the dlc aswell its great and also will help explain the story better).
dayz is in alpha yes but its completeley broken it is fun yes but its alot more frustrating and you will spend alot of time dying for no reason will a fully geared guy also being a hero then being beaten down by bambies or just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things. some bugs in this game: randomly dying, rubberbanding, massive glictches, super low FPS, all servers barely cant even login to them, spawns are ♥♥♥♥ i would rather gouge my eyes out with a rusty spoon then run anthoer 2 hours just too get somewhere good, graphics being cerebral and stuffing all the time, invicible zombies that can run faster than usain bolt and can walk through walls and hit you 20m away and cant die from any weapon also kill you one hit, the players of dayz: there are 2 types of people hackers most common or bandits. this game gave me AIDS. i would rather listen to stephen hawking give a 2 week speech with a glicthing voice on how to do maths. no dont buy this in its current state its AIDS. this game caused 9/11 and the holocaust
