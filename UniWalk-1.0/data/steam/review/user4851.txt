My experiences with this dark, memorable game so far. Potential small spoilers, nothing that will ruin your experience but might help you decide if you want this game.I was exploring the game Sunless Sea, where you adventure across the dark ocean in a dark London.I met a female spy and consequently bedded her, resulting in a child.I at the time was only living in a small room above a pub,I had the money to buy a sizable manor from doing work with the mafia.I ventured out once more on an errand for the Admiralty for the Royal Navy, only to come across a woman up far north in the coldest of places, asking to join my crew. I declined her not realising that she would put forth a dark evil upon me, a curseI didn't think much of it and ventured home.I came home to a dead lover and a dead son.My neglect to buy the manor before I left shore and take in my son had left my him without a good home, leaving him and his mother to die.The curse caught up with me,The Zee had caught up with me,It had taken my family.I asked the harbour master about the happenings around London, he told me the mafia worker wanted to speak with me.An errand He gave to me to venture to the far east to fetch an expensive shipment had gone under my nose and therefore forgotten.He was not happy at all. The local authorities, bribed, had fired upon my small vessel, ripped steel from steel and taken me and my crew.The Zee had me now.That's my first three hours of Sunless Sea.
