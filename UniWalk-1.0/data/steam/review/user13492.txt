Great game so far even though its in alpha i still think stranded deep has a chance against big titles such as rust or ark survival evolved it will be amazing in the future with ideas such as multiplayer co-op and non co-op aswell as a proper finishing game storyline.I hope this game gets lots of support in the future for this could be the next game we see at e3 :O
Enjoyable gameplay and grinding is fun as hell(latest review) still really fun to date
I've your looking for a fast paced action shooter or if your looking for a interesting story or maybe even a fun filled challenging zombie shooter here you are.I'm really impressed with this game it is ridicously fun and packed full of action for you.Why are you even reading this you should have already bought it by now :3 8/10 for me
If you put money into this game you won't regret you basically can't finish it im not even halfway im pretty sure
Now i love super smash bros and melee(Super smash bros melee)If you do this is the game for you its got the mechanics of super smash bros the art of 2d pixel and amazing roster of characters(The roster gets updated) all with that its most of the time fair the matches are the characters are and some of the characters even have the same moves as some of the people from super smash bros melee such as fox and falco.In all honesty i respect this game for being inspired by super smash bros melee and i love so if you enjoy super smash bros melee this is a worth try at
Looking for a Friday The 13th Game this is your place (until the actual one comes out) well anyways dead by daylight is a hide and seek game but with killers and teenagers.The game may seem boring and become bland later on when you play it for a while but this game is getting updated alot.The characters you play as seeming if they are a killer or a survivor you can have different perks or addons to items and certain characters have there own unique perks(Some of them are teachable to other survivors or killers) The servers aren't the best because the killer hosts the game so if they were across the world and so were you you would lag alot but im sure in the future of this game that will be fixed.Anyways if you enjoy Horror Movies Or Horror Games this might be the game for you.
1/10 IGN I tried to order a pizza but they said i was john madden
Fnaf 1 is best cause they look better and because i remember the classic characters Freddy The ♥♥♥♥bear,Chica The Pedophile,Foxy the drug addict and bonnie the 360 noscoper Good Times
It was all fine until the trailer then i was like meh companys then a played a bit and when i heared the cat snore noise i uninstalled as quicker then you can say supercalafraglisticexpaledosheis (excuse my last word there if its wrong)
Amazing game would want a number 3
