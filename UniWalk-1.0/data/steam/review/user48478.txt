This is a very interesting game. There's been a lot of effort put into the early access game so far, and there's still more to come. I've just scratched the surface, and am keen to keep exploring.
A good good game. It can be a little repetitive over time, and would benefit from more challenges to choose from, but that is debatable as there is an attraction in just floating around slowly building up. Overall a great way to kill some time, highly recommended to have in your library.
