Undertale is pretty much one of the only RPGs by far where choices really do matter, just like in real life and with what choice you make can eventually come back to bite you.This game is such a phenomenal approach to not only as a RPG but within the Indie category of games as well, if it wasn't for it's unique battle screen, multiple endings, that one scene with Mettaton in it that pays homage to Final Fantasy VI, extremely emotional and sad ending (True Pacifist), and most importantly it's completely original storyline and soundtrack. This game truely defines what a game should really consist of and this game is an excellent example of a well-made game. The storyline is perhaps the most important element and it is a really big convention of all games out there. Depending on what choice you make in this game, even if it's having the tiniest amount of EXP can actually mess up your next ending. The idea of the parts completely changing in the current and the next game, depending on the user's actions is probably one of the smartest ideas I have ever seen within a game.Don't judge this game for its graphics or the massive fanbase, that's like judging a book by it's cover and what other people like. This game is by far the best indie RPG I have ever played and I seriously recommend you give this game a shot if you haven't done so yet.In conclusion, this game has helped me gained inspiration to study game designing in the future. This game is by far what a true RPG should consist of, not because of its graphics or its fanbase, but for its storyline and mechanics. Therefore I give this game a 10/10!EDIT: Undertale's 1st anniversary is coming soon!
