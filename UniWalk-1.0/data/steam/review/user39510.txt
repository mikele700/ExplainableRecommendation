Lets get this out of the way. This game will take you 1.5-2 hours to complete. There is no replay value. No branching paths or alternative endings. No real game mechanics. It is entirely narrative focused. It asks the player to reflect, to analyze past what it presented. It can be interpreted as narcissistic, self-indulgent or up its own ♥♥♥. If these things will bother you, then you probably won't like this game. I do recommend giving it a chance.Because having said this, I cannot stop thinking about this game. It is the most engaging game I have played in recent memory.  If you go in expecting a unique and complex experience, you won’t be disappointed. For the reasons I have listed above it will be hailed as “not a game”. To that I say, just shut up. Please. A game can be whatever it wants to be. Something, something encourage diversity in gaming, something, something, Call of Duty, something, something, or else the robots win.
