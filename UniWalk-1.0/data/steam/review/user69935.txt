Gaben is Love, Gaben is Life...I was only 12 years old.I loved CS:GO so much.I had all the rare skins.I pray to Gaben every night, hoping I would unbox a knife some day.-Gaben is love,- I said. -Gaben is life.-My dad overhears me and calls me a hacker.I know he-'s just jealous that I got recruited into FaZe clan.I call him a hardscoper.My dad no scopes me and sends me to my room.As I feel my numb face, I turn on my PC and log into Steam.My hands are shivering as I click on the -PLAY- button to open up CS:GO-I-'ll show that hardscoper,- I said.I open up the Steam Market Place, and purchase 20 Half Life 3 Cases and Keys.10 minutes have passed by, and I-'ve unboxed 19 Battle-Scarred Negev l Desert Strikes.As I move my cursor over to the final case, I click and select -OPEN-.My cursor moves even slower as I move it towards the giant, green -USE KEY- button.I click the button.As I see all of these weapons fly by, the scroll finally starts slowing down.-I can-'t look,- I said to myself. -My dad will noscope me when he see-'s that I-'ve spent six grand on super exclusive and rare Half Life 3 Cases and Keys.I close my eyes and listen as I hear Gaben laughing over me, as if I am almost certain that I did not get a knife. I open my eyes. A large clump of feces leaves my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ very quick, as my eyes look at the item I have just been given by the Holy Gaben himself.Another clump starts sliding out as I stand up to run to my dad to tell him that I-'ve just unboxed a StatTrak Factory New Karambit Fade.My dad cries as he suddenly gets his Steam account hacked by OpTic.I pull out my new knife and quickscope his face.I then walk into my room, take my pants off, and thrust my pelvic region into the air, imagining Gaben with me.-Gaben is love, Gaben is life.-
