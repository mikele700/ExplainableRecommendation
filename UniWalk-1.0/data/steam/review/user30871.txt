Freakin' amazing game, get on itEdit: 29/03/15So after all these years and hours playing this game, I format my computer and forgot about my saves....... I lost a character that I put over 300 hours into, completed most quests, areas, crafting.Even after the lose of my character, I Ioaded up Skyrim and started all again just because it is that good!
