CS:GO Is a fast paced fps that takes skill and strategy (unlike cod where u just spray your heart out and no matter what u do u will hit someone) It takes imense skill to learn how to control your weapon's spray patterns and get those very crucial headshots. CS:GO is the closest anyone has gotten to the perfect fps, hell it could even be the perfect fps, the game is all about self progression and pushing yourself to be better then u were the match before, learn about ur mistakes, control ur gun  and most importantly kill the other team! The game isnt about unlocking guns and huge as scopes and all of that crap, it cuts strate to the chase ( you all have the same pool of weapons, they, theres nothing in the game that can give you an advantage  exept yourself) CS:GO provides more than just better graphics than its previous versions, it provides a variety of game modes that everyone can have fun in, more guns, and of course more nades. It is also a very balanced game in which there are no cheat guns and if you die it was probably your fault or u just got caught at close range with a sniper, but that said you should be able to kill your opponent at close range with your sniper if your good enough. There are still some things that CS:GO might have to improve on, but these things are things that all fps games suffer from such as campers and hackers, that nothing valve can do will stop them, ussually there are no hackers in your game, it is very rare for u to come by one if u play on official servers because of the vac (valve anti cheat) program. In all CS:GO has fun updates, great gameplay, and gorgeous gun skins haha! If your looking for an fps to buy this is the only choice you really have because of how amazing it is.
The best most balanced and amazing multiplayer of all! Whats the point of considering gettin it? it's Free! and it would be worth every penny if it wasn't
