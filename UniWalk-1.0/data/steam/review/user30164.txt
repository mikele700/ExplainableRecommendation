I like the demo, the mechanics are good, and it's free. I mean, it includes a Keemstar rat in it, and how many other games have that? In my opinion, this is the kind of game you laugh at and make a joke about, which I can appreciate.I'd rate it 8/10 because it's free and has some entertaining and funny moments.
