This game is a really good game it dayz mixed with minecraft to the fact it is made by a 16 year makes it even more amazingThis game is played better though with friend or just muiltplayer in general
HOLY ♥♥♥♥ This game is amazing derping around and blowing up the whole map while killing the bad guys as the overpowered heros with a wide range of weapons from dual pistols to a flame thower shotgun but one best bits about this game is destoying the whole level and the other best bit is that it FREE keep up the good work Devs :D
Do you need a game to waste hours on? then look no further then this game it has City building, Population need, Supply chains, Research, Nukes and War with Ships and Aircraft. This game is AMAZINGLY AWESOME you will most likely spend over a day playing on 1 save. Also the get the Deep Sea Expansion with add even more stuff and buying out island though buying shares on island. GET IT :D
A great game very much like Sins of a Solar Empire but with more gameplay mechincs like making ships that use only one type of weapon and choosing a planet is specialised at. There also a hero system which is based around the resource called Dust. Important note this is Turn based game
A must get for all gamers who enjoy making random stuff or playing muiltplayer with player made modes and mods
You have to get this game as it is amazing and the mods give even more replay ability
