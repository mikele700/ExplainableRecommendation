Great game! Especially for people with a creative mind! I suggest playing with other people to have maximum quality and see how much creativeness your mind can withhold.If you are really creative you can create your own gamemode or even your own map, it depends on your hearts desire on what you want to do in this game! Create battles, create buildings or plain sillyness. As long as your having fun on the game.BTW the first thing i saw on a sandbox server was player models doing a pose. so yea, its a great game!
Really good! So Little Bugs and good gameplay. But if your in western areas finding people to play this game is hard to find.But I truly Recomend this game to be played! You wil not know how much you will be playing it for!But be carefull of Scammers!I truly Recommend this!

Very good game... But the items you get is not in your inventory when offline... BUT still a very good game
A great game! A game that shows how hard inspectors at airports work and the stress of making sure no terrorists pass the border!
