Interesting to play, the clunky mechanics support the idea that you generally aren't particularly strong, which adds to the whole survival element of the game. That being said it can sure as hell get annoying. It's also quite repetitive. Still, worth a play.
A reasonable 'unofficial end' to the burnout series, but far from the best. Having grown up on the console versions from the original through to revenge, I was actually disappointed by a few things, most notably the 'removal' of crashes as a core-component (as in, they're in there, but they're not essential to progress). Sometimes I found the new open world feature a little annoying. I want to go straight to an event - but no, instead I have to muck around driving to it, only to realise I don't have the right sort of car, so I have to spend ages driving back to somewhere I can swap a car just to go back and compete. Although, it was something new and it made things kind of fun. It even made you want to 'line up' your challenges, so that the end of one race was close to the start of another....I found it a bit unfulfilling, a lot of the unlocks came too easy and made little sense... I feel as though it's a bit of a victim of instant gratification-esque achievements in an attempt to try and woo gamers with short attention span that only enjoy frequent accomplishments rather than gamers that prefer a real challenge. Also I can now never listen to that stupid Guns 'n' Roses song ever again.... avoid if you like, and/or want to continue liking Guns 'n' Roses.
