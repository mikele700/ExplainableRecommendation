I don-'t see how people think this game is decent.I don-'t know why people compare it to ground-breaking zombie titles like Killing Floor or L4D2.It-'s just another gamemode. A Garry-'s Mod gamemode. And besides, what-'s the point of having an -armoured- zombie when the regular AI can survive two point-blank shotgun blasts? It-'s pointless, really.-Make damage factors more realistic-Use better zombie models-Add more types of zombies-Remove the -1 minute standstill- kick-Add more maps.
