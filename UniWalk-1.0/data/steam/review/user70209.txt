I don't know why so many people dislike this game. It's the closest you can get to a good sci-fi dogfight game without playing Star Wars Battlefront II!
When you play this game, you feel like a real trucker. This is what makes this game as authentic and unique as it is.10/10
As jacksepticeye would say, this game is BOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
