A very simple and fun shooter :) excellent weapons = no tryhards and years of fun!!
This has got to be one of the worst and most frustrating games I have ever played. Every aspect and potential fun of the game is ruined by glitches and annoyances. How long has the game been delayed now? what the hell have you even done with all this time? added jumpers and hats? not even one vehicle or anything majorly new for that fact, has been released in the standalone. granted this is still an early access game, but this joke of a game has made little to no major progress over the original mod. It is the same bland game with no vehicles, a massive map, undersatisfying rewards and takes a massive amount of time to accumulate everything you need to have a DECENT time. And that is if you don't glitch out or die from stepping through a door. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP. I have truly lost hope in the developers, i sincerely hope they bring this game back up to the standards of the arma mod version although it probably is impossible and would take 10 lifetimes. This game is a massive joke and do not waste your time with it, you should just buy arma and use the mod or epoch. This game in its current state is broken as hell and does not even deserve a rating.
