Was Fighting yoda as a clone and all i did was walk backwars and shoot9002001/10GotgGame Of The Generation:sentry:
Runs smoothly on medium graphics on my dinosuar of a computer. I can see myself playing this in the future when i have a ship with confusing controls and holograms everywhere!9/10the best spaceship simulator i've played yet.Edit: I love the fact that its in the milkyway galaxy!
Alright game, confusing at first but i got the hang of it. later i started to notice little simularities to the mobile game Galaxy on fire 2 this pleased me, because i loved that mobile game and it remined me of my holiday.im gonna give this game a 9/10 
after doing the tutorial i got in and i was like -whats this? whats this?!-then i check my tickets and i have 700 thousand and im like wtf? so naturally i spend the whole lot10/10 100/100 best desktop.... BEST DESKTOP
This game is a small funny little simple game were you must take care of goats and help them grow(yea right!)glitched so hard my goat became a horse300/10would goat again
#BetterThanCodmake it a trend for this game
okay here we go.....well theres to many in-game purchuses and really i know the game is free but that could use some work also i like the war system and i totaly reconmend this to any of those creative minds out there but i think that the devs should add like a part that can move block like say an arm you could make it swing backwards and forwards that would be awsome :D
Ok here's my reveiw for this game/standalone mod for Hl2:Pros:the game can be used for many things, such as modelling, stop-motion animation, firefights, pictures/art and buildingThe game also has a wide range of 'Minigames' withing the games multiplayer servers, these range from sandbox mode to Hide and seek.The game is highly moddable, it has a community following of modders/porters for multiple games, For example you can spawn in a W.A.C Plane (A type of mod that adds planes/helicopters) and gun down some poor innocent covenant elites from Halo.Cons:The game does offer very little in vanilla content, but thats not the important part, (its almost nit-picking!)The game REQURES other games such as CS:S For most of the community mods, This can be annoying.But overall, I'd give it a 10/10
