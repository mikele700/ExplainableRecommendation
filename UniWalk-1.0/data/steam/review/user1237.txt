This game is Extreamly fun. There are many things to do in this game like, killing/branding warchifes and captains, launching ambushes, riots, and just plain executions. I hope that the game is going to be a series, and in the next game, i would like the ability to have an arena mode, where you fight captain after captain, make your own opponents and re-fight any previously fought warchife and his captains.10/10
