Got encumbered with too much food on the first day.Ended up spending 5 days inside a house just sleeping and eating just like real life.10/10
A guy rammed my ship.I spent the next 5-10 minutes farming resources to build a gun then raided his ship and killed him till he decided to rage quit.10/10Game is fun as hell but that fun gets old really quickly. Unless you're a very creative person you're probably better off not buying this game until a few more updates come around. At the moment all you can really do is build, sure there are missiles and weapons but you only get to use em against either meteorites or other players, and that's assuming you have a good connection.So buy it if you're not patient or creative. Otherwise, just wait a bit more to see if this game becomes something you'd like to play before deciding.
Good game albiet a tad short (Granted still in beta)Very familiar setting for those who have played terraria, Mod friendly, and still plenty of more features coming, for 15 bucks it's not that bad.
