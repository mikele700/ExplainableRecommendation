I really enjoy this game i like restoring cars but after im done it feels like theres no purpose so it would be really cool if they added some more test tracks and objectives overall its a good game and a step up from the 2014 editon
really fun game buy it its worth it
Stoy is kinda mah but the world is amazing. If have not played Far Cry 3 I recomend you go play that becasue it is way better then this game. But this game is fun the story isnt as good as it was in far cry 3 but you will still have alot of fun out of this game and at less get 30 hours of gameplay out of it. This game is basically just a reskin of far cry 3 but I still had fun playing it and there is heaps of things to do.
