wile the games graphics are is nice  though the game suffers from kinda boring puzzles at times super anoying vagenes  that   can be kinda of a pain  (( ei all holes but one are a death trap ))but over all  its a good story i   and  some of the flavour text and the few refeances were funny  but it was kinda rare  looks pretty though the problem is all summed up the game got to a really good bit the shortness of the campain and it ends were the games just getting interesting  so i  can't recommend you pay this wait till its finshed  also if theres only too parts and there so spaced out as not to give  dates  i think the game would work better split up as Broken age part 1 and 2 and sold half price of the full product and i fell better recommending it as it stands there are better   games for the asking price
