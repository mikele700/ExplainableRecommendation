I have found game to be very... great at what it does, (I hope thats making you sit down shutup and concentrate) because it did that to me for an hour just sitting their reconfiguring all my trains just thinking that 'I like Trains' all that I wish for is to be able to have a sydney map then this game would be perfect. Overall it's a great game even though its an early access game and I plan on playing it for many hours to come, good job developer all that I require is a map maker
This game was probably one of those decently challenging games with an easy to understand storyline even though the texts come at you in large quanties it delievers a lot about the storyline, the gameplay itself is fantastic even though i finished it in about 4 hours the puzzles in this game were challenging but not too overly hard where you get to the point of bashing your computer in but it has a nice decent gradual difficulty climb and i like how you could achieve the same thing but in different ways,
