A very well made retro looking adventure game with a twist I had a ball playing through this.
I was pleasently suprised how much i enjoyed this game i got it cheap in a humble bundle, the combat system is fun and easy to use and the open world type gameplay is a really good way to kick back and get lost in the story for a few hours
Great game I like how you can finish each mission however you like
just another epic step in the Elder scrolls series, the game will give you hundreds of hours of enjoyment and supports a ton of mods to customise it any way you like
