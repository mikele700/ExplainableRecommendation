Even better then Space Engineers10/10 would buy again -IGN
One of the best First Person Zombeh shooters straight after Half Life 2 and Left 4 Dead: GOTY (Game of the year) edition. I shall reccommend it to all L4D Fanz!
This game is good for simulating human VS Dinosaur. The rampage mode allows you to be a dino and is fun. I highly reccomend the game
Did you really want to find a ******* excuse not to buy this epic game? Go **** yourself and buy it, lol.
I haven't played it much but yeah it's cool.
BEST GAME EVER
