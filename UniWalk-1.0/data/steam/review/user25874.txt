i was really hoping for a game like Monster Jam Path of Destruction.... not this Trials rip-off. it also kinda felt like i was playing the moblie game of Monster Jam.the control that you have on the truck in arena mode was very wonky, which is a shame.3/10 wouldn't recommend to anyone that loved the console games
all round good game
