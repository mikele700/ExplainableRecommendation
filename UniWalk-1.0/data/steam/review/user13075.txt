this game is really fun, i cant stop playing it, but one of these friend i had were right, if this had a story mode to play it would probably help me understand why they are using dragons and lazers nnnd stuff, itd also explain what those giant ships are. Over all that tho this game is great and id 100% recommend this game.
:neckbeard: feel like this rn
