I have spent many of hours with the roller coaster Tycoon series and loved them all. but this one is the Pits.  Crap overall game play and I know its in it's early phase but its not fun,If you want a great game to play and I have spent hours on it allready, is PLANET COASTER.  WOW graphics are fantastic and buildings you can design and sculpt. hours and hours of enjoyment.
