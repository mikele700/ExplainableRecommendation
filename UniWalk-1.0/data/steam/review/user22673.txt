Great Game -7/25
This game is AWESOME if you like killing endless amounts of zombies and pumped up zombies with alot of steroids!
Dead Island is a very fun game where you go around completeing quests and smashing zombies heads in.
Its got a horrible engine and the graphics are ♥♥♥♥.
Its a really unstable and over demanding game but extremely fun with a few mods, but with more that like 3 mods and it will crash all the time
I dont have any textures :( 0/10
