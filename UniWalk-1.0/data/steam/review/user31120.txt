If you don't mind the bad graphics and slight lack of dialogue, then you will love this game. The world of stillwater is so much fun to explore, and there are even some activities that didn't make it in to Saints Row the Third and Saints Row 4. Play this.
This is a great game. The visuals are awesome, the weapons are awesome and the bosses are awesome. The only problem is that the ending is anticlimatic to say the least. Buy it, sale or not, and be ready to murder many robots.
This game is an interesting piece of... something. I would say that it's a bad game, mostly because it's trying to be a horror game and it isn't, it's extremely overpriced, the graphics range from okay to eye-bleedingly bad, has way too many bugs and the story is extremely hard to follow. BUT. Even though it really doesn't feel like a Resident Evil game, I'd hate to say it, but the co-op is sort of fun. I love how the game gives players different tasks and makes them get seperated and cover eachother. It just feels... interesting. Also, killing ememies is incredibly satisfying. Some of the boss battles are sort of cool, like the one on the second chapter of Chris 'n' Piers' campaign. Also, if you play it with a friend, laughing at the many broken things you find is awesome. So... I give this game a recommendation.
Full of friendly friends, seriously, don't worry. they're all friends, don't run from them, just hug them, so many commas in this sentence, hug them, please.(BUT ACTUALLY THOUGH GOOD GAME 8/10 GOOD AND SPOOKY)
This is the greatest of games.
