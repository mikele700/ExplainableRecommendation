my favorite stealth simulator so far 11/10 would lock themselves in their room
11/10 would buy Liberation Day since you'll be wanting for more :D
Best anti-stress game I've played so far xD
This game is a must-buy for forever alone people like me XD :Ava: :Chigara: :Sola: :Asaga:
Definitely one of the best Strategy games available in the market
