I've had this game for about a year now, and I've got to say, it's been one of my favourites in my library.Nothing is much better than sending a poor kerbal straight into the ground at insane speeds, so if you didn't buy this game for the spacecraft building or the realistic gravity simulation, It can always be used as a good stress reliever.
