Dont know why anyone would mark this game down just because it realesed a paid DLC. Its an amazing and super fun game with friends. The graphics are glorious and i myself am super excited for the new DLC even if i have to pay for it. Getting hung up on the whole early access thing is just getting in your way of enjoying a great game. Dont hate be a mate
