Amazing game, simple but amazing, lots of different items, guns, and miscs. When I first saw this game I thought that it was just one of those crappy indie ones but when I started playing it, I got so hooked that I never stopped playing it. What really makes me impressed in the game is how only one person developed it (Nelson), the stealth system, and the various guns that you can acquire throughout the map. This game is still early access but it feels like it's already a finished product because of it having few glitches (which are very rare to encounter). Please play this game and maybe give a little support to Nelson for all the work he's done just to make this game possible, I guarantee you that you won't be dissapointed. :)
