I didn't play it for that long, but it's good
GAME REVIEW: Its a good game now that it is free until the 26th but it does have these following freutures -GOOD GRAPHICS -INTENSE ZOMBIE KILLING -GOOD WEAPONSThis is probably the best game i ever played 
Played it on free weekend once, i have to say it is a wonderful game. I think that Zues hads a good potential at taking a new perspective to the Arma series throughout the years, the strategy involved Arma's first person was wonderful but now making in top down, was a very good investment. i truly enjoyed it.
