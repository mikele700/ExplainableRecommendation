War thunder is an amazing versotile flight game. I love the way how you can choose the difficulty of the game ranging from Easy to Simulation. The online play works very well, although I do wish there was an AU server. There is a great selection of iconic aircraft from world war two, from 5 nations ranging from BiPlanes to Jets. There is a whole load of fun to be had in this game, and the best thing is, its free to play! I garentee, if you give this a shot, uou will find yourself playing this game, until you have reached Nerd lvl +99 like me, and have 1500+ hours ingame!
Great game, all time classic. Graphics could be a bit better, but the controls are pretty solid. sometimes this can get glitches, but overall, great game with an amazing multiplayer experience!
