Just wait till the end. Its absolutely awsome. Mind you as with Farcry3 I spent monotonous hours getting all the sidequests done. But man what an ending.
I did enjoy this game. Remember that its really a mobile port to a PC. For a tablet game its really slick. But it falls far short of the excelent DXHR. There are two areas that are really well thought out and echos the great design of the other games farily well. I played through twice and enjoyed each time. Its worth the price on PC but would be better played on a tablet to appreciate the development challenges that the devs overcame.
I love this Game. On my first play I pretty much sped through it to get the most of the story. I played the Missing link after the main story and kind of thought it would have been better 3/4 of the way in the game. A year later I played the directors cut when it came out. This time I explored more areas and was pleased to see the missing link placed in the order of the story. At the end I had all of the side quests done and about half of teh achivements. When I attempted my 3rd playthrough I wanted to get -Pacifist- and -Factory Default Zero- achievements, in that mode of play it really felt like a completely different game where you needed a highened level of awareness of your surroundings and a strategy through most areas. Systematically knocking unconcious every enemy on a level is pretty silly, but passing areas without being seen  is what makes this potential Action game into one of the all time Stealth greats.
