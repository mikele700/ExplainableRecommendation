It's a great game for sitting down and just letting a day go by. It may get boring at times but getting that new upgrade or building that new garage is always a good feeling. I would recomend this game for somone that has a lot of spare time or just loves simulators.
It's that time of year again, where everything it christmas related. This is one of those where you go wow. The detail of the trucks that come with this DLC is epic. I guess Santa wanted a truck for Christmas 11/10 from me.
This Game will test your reflexes and your patience. make sure that you come in expecting to fail nearly everytime. But that one time you win, You feel like a Boss but you were home and there were no friends for you to boast to. Well this game is great for everyone who just needs something to fill in time.
