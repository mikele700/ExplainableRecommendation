Terrible game. Terrible support. Terrible money hungry devs - What an embarrassment of a title on steam. Each and every person involved with this mess should be ashamed of themselves. AVOID!!!
What could have been a refreshing bit of fun is constantly ruined by the lingering bugs from the original game. Game loading & regular crashes, bugs - You name it. They're all mostly here still and it's an insult to be frank with you.Don't waste your cash on this, It's not even worth the $3 it took to upgrade during that 'special' promotion.AVOID
One of the finest puzzlers I've ever played. The music is soothing and the levels get better as you progress. I'm ashamed that I didn't pick up Hexcells sooner!I highly recommend this game to everyone, even those that aren't into the genre. You will not regret it.
Antenna is quite short and simple but in no way does that make it bad. There is no tutorial or campaign; you learn everything yourself as you progress and you simply move on to the next puzzle upon completion. Some would argue that this isn't their style, in fact most would, and that's fine - It's not for everyone.I really liked it though and look forward to playing the next game the dev releases. Good stuff!
It's a nice little 1-2 hour puzzle game. Definitely worth a play through if you're looking for something different.
Brilliant app and a must have for gamers that love using their gamepads frequently. If I knew about this sooner I'd have saved a lot of time and trouble, though I'm glad I found it eventually! Good stuff
