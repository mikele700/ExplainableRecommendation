I love this game more then life.
Quite possibly one of my favourite games ever, small and simple yet fun and challenging at times, forcing you to be quite devious... you can always try this game free on browser and get hooked on like me, but if you like it, support them by buying it on steam. Bloody good game 10/10 will enjoy wasting my whole life on it

Deadset amazing
Great game with plenty of Neat Easter eggs, comprising of parkour, shoot outs, zombie skull smashin (well obviously) and running while leaving a trail of ♥♥♥♥ as you scramble to escape zombie clutches of a night time. would definately get if you like zombie games and ♥♥♥♥ing around with useless enemies during the day, and getting a challenge during the night
