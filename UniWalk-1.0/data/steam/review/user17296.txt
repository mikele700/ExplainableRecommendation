Its a nice little indie game to play, I find that it can get boring because when I played I only found limited things to do. I reccomend the game for spare time when you have nothing to play.... I would say its a good game to play with friends.
Trove, now review, positive? Trove reminded me in the slightest of Cubecraft and is a nice and deacent gaphics game.The gameplay was supurb and I find it very addictive.Tho slightly dissapointed as to there is not many thngs to do, but my thought of many is....Playing a duengeon, exploration, multiplayer battles, co-op, trading and buying items etc.And this game has some of those.Overall, a very nice little game, I reccomend it highly, nice cubic graphics, awesome fighting experience and display.9/10NOTE: There is no violence in a way that shows blood or gore, or coarse language for that matter.
Great game, you can turn blood off but you don't know when your bleeding so I would keep it on. Uh I do recommend it but it's twice as fun if you have friends playing with you but yeah its an awesome game. 9/10
Fun and enjoyable,counter strike creaters did well.
