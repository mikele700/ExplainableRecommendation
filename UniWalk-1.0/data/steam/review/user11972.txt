Most epic space game I've seen in a long time...And the fact that its still in Alpha makes it all so much better, cant wait to see the final release.Things this game lacks: -Customization (Yea ik,its still in alpha,but still)                                        -Players & Servers                                         -Wide variety of mapsWhat makes this game great:-Epic space battles                                                 -Huge teamwork needed                                                  -Awesome ships with different playstyles each
Epic customizations,everything is cheap
