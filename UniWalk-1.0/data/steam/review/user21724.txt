i have followed this game for many versions and i have to say that now that it-'s officially out i am very disappointed, the intro was very good and interesting but the moment i stepped on the starting planet i realized the game had gotten much harder, the planet i was on had killer bees on both sides that can kill you with one hit, after i managed to get some decent equipment i also realized that not only did they add a whole lot more crafting tables, items and crafting materials, that are all thrown at you instead of getting gradually unlocked as the previous versions did, another thing i dislike was that the positioning of the spawn location had made it very inconvenient to get the side quests and the tutorial quests that were used to show you how to progress and unlock upgraded items were essentially removed which made me take a lot more time to find out how to actually upgrade my items (btw you have to push the -upgrade button- on the top of the crafting table) overall my problems can be mainly attributed with design and after a while i couldnt take it anymore 4/10
