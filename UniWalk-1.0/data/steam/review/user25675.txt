[Optional hidden Spoilers] So, I torrented this game as I was initially slightly sceptical of it.After playing for about 4-8 hours I ended up completely finishing it  and the optional second proper ending!    It was so bloody good I had to purchase it and the complete soundtrack which was incredibly well made and complimented the game perfectly. They definitely deserve this with the hard work put into it. And here I am to share how good it is.Damn. I don-'t think I-'ve played a video game this well done in years. Definitely the type of adventure I-'ve been looking for honestly. The actual game itself is funny witty and has some smart points worth noting in it. Keeps up with jokes and well timed metahumour. The music is absolutely insane. So much emotion, action and hype every time the battle themes kick in and the character design has been weaved in incredibly well too. Individual personalities and I guess you could say an entire -Theme-.I would definitely recommend, and if I could -True Reset- to a week ago in real life.. and play it again. I definitely would.10/10 Game. Beautiful Soundtrack, Character Design and Humour. I love it and would recommend it to everybody possibleNever forget  http://i.imgur.com/lYMgk1n.jpg 
Just did a 3 hour session with some mates. Isn't network intensive, pretty fun to muck around and adventure in
Current Version doesn't seem to work. Many people say it's because of dual monitor setups but still.
