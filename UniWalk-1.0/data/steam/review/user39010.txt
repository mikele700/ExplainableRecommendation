133 hours and i still havent finished it! I will keep trying though! To begin ship selection is restricted to a single vessel but once they're all unlocked through in-game events there is a great selection, each catering to different playstyles. Combat is fast and unforgiving especially if your enemy has an advantage over your craft at that time. Having a level 3 teleporter and 4 mantis boarding crew with stars means nothing if the enemy is a probe with no atmosphere on board. Good micro-management during combat is vital and incredibly satisfying when you pull it off. Fires break out, systems go down and hull breaches appear all of which require crew to manage. There are also environmental factors to consider, like solar flares igniting fires or asteroid fields wrecking your shields. Upgrading your ship is easy and there is so many different upgrades you will be experimenting for a while. Different ships start out with different systems and new systems can be installed in shops throughout the game using the in-game currency: scrap. Highly recommended.
Do not buy this -game-. Calling it an alpha is too generous. It-'s unplayable. A great example is my game time not logging properly. I have put over 20 hours into the stand alone. Every few months I boot it up for an hour or so to see how things are going but I-'m done wasting my time. Even at its worst the arma 2 mod was better by far. Zombie AI just keeps degenerating with every patch. As of writing this review they completely ignore any kind of walls or barriers. Most lives will just be spent trying on different types of hats and then dying of starvation. And if you-'re lucky enough to bump into someone they will shoot you dead 99 times out fo 100. Do not waste thirty bucks on this abortion.
