When my boyfriend first got it, I said, -Really? A game with cars and sports crossed over? That-'s so stupid, such a typical boys-' game.-This comment was quickly taken back after I watched Mr.Fruits-' videos on it and desperately wanting to try it for myself. Without even trying my bf-'s game, he soon bought it for me.24 hrs later, I have spent a quarter of that time playing Rocket League. So, do I like it?Well, as Flo Rida once sang, -I don-'t like it, I love it.-
Have you ever wondered what it's like being a rock in space?Now you can become one! First, you're just a tiny little rock but then you can grow! (only if you choose to do so). But remember to savour the times of being a beautiful star, because eventually, you'll just grow old, become a blackhole that can eat baby blackholes and guess what happens. You eat everything.
A cute little puzzle games with amazing art and a soothing background music...with a pinch of frustration.
In this game, you can be all three classes!1) An old dancy man. 2) A squirrel woman.3) A fat ♥♥♥ with a beer belly. But overall, it is really fun. :) Lots of laughing when you play with a friend :)
