Amazing.Love the different aspects of theis game, the developers realy make you think about how you are going to plan the traps for the night to give you an edge over the monsters.And i love the fact that they make you pay dearly if you have misplaced a trap or a bait and you will have to mak do with your axe.Also making the main character waeker than the enimies is a great idea it realy makes you think that if you have to use hand to hand combat (or in this instance, axe to claw) you have to use every thing you can to get an advantag, from using your musket, making an attmept with your axe, or even luring your enemies to a trap that hasent been used. Also I love that you realy have to use anything to put distance between an army of werewolves and yourself and bonfires are the best to do so, because if you think that if just yur axe will get you through the night your are wrong.And having the buildins to protect is a great idea it makes the night less about making sure that the character lives and more about making sure the builds survive.All in all -Sang Froid Tales Of Werewolves- one of the best stratagies/action games I have ever played.Hope they release a sequal, remeber this is tome 1.
Simply put... AMAZING.Greatest game i have played this year. The nemisis system is so facinating how you can make a enemy just by thinking that you have killed someone or they may have killed you, they are not bosses that are in a set place they move around the world and you could just bump into them or they might try and find you to get revenge.. Amazing story that got me right in the feels. Also great level design, theirs something about wandering around mordor that makes you feel at the center of the middle earth universe. Great charchter devolpment. And im looking forward to the dlc to learn more about celebrimbors story.
