I have not yet played the original Euro Truck Simulator, but boy, this one-'s good. The graphics are great for a simulator, and the physics are very realistic. The array of camera angles would make some great scenes for a Youtube video, and going into a quarry to drop off large pipes can be quite -interesting-.The only nitpick i have about this game is sometimes the horn sounds are quite soft, but that-'s about it.Buy this game when there-'s a sale :D-Diamond
