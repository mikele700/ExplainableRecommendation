Greate concept but.. if i were able to play that game that would be amazing. The 1.4 hours i have in game is trubble shooting it to work. and i searched online for about 2 months for an answer to my problems and i have yet to find one. My compute specs are just above mimimume requirements and i still can't run it. I wish steam allowed my to refund the $89.99 that i wasted on this game before it was realised. I really like all the ACU games before this game. Atleast those games can run normally. Hopefully the next game will be much better then this game.
Amazing game.10/10 on the Story 6/10 on gameplayIf you want to play the game be prepared to think in a way you never though of doing. The levels are to extreme for normal portal players, I needed the help of the guide on some parts of the game mostly the begginging. The ending was dissapoainting not the best boss fight.I hope they have another game as -her- being your enemy.Total score 8/10
