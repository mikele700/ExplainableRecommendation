Don't go into this thinking it is a kids game, it is very dark and very heavy on themes. It is a wonderful story, it is my #1 favourite game, i can't think of anybody i wouldn't reccoment too
Most addictive and most difficult game i've ever played, for $3.00, its worth it
Such a great game, so much fun, BUY IT!!
Engaging puzzles and great storyline, i dont see how i couldn't reccomend it!
AWESOME GAME MUST GET
Almost failed my drivers test because of it!10/10
The worst thing I have ever played! Take Killing Floor, then put it into a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Halo setting and mix in some dinosaurs. After one hour in a basement with a 1987 Apple Macintosh, you get ORION: Dino Horde
