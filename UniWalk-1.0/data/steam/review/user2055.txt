10/10 An amazing design. One of the most challenging games I have ever played. The game's community, well most of it doesn't welcome newbies with open arms but this is due to the diffculty of the whole game together. This is a game that you can just sink your teeth into for a while. If you like strategy hardcore this is the game for you plus its free. The best thing is that its fair from the start of every match, the only advantage of playing the game for longer is the experinse of actually playing the game.
