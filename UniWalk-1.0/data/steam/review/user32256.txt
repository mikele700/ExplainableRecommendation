A whole lot better than DOOM 3, a reboot of the classic run and gun formula. A must have game for any serious FPS fan.
I spent over 100 hrs on this game in a mearly a few weeks, yep this would be one of the best RPGs ever made.
One of the oldest and greatest FPS series to grace our online community, nothing beats CS for its 5v5 action.
