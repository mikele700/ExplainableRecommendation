Now... Let me start off here, when this company made a peice of trash. I am talking to YOU Telltale,  you could say i was nearly the happiest person alive. when i begged my mum for $25 the -'package-' said that I WILL get, -All Episodes including IF you get this season pass!- so yeah, i got it, played the five episodes. When i woke up today i saw on youtube it said -Minecraft Story Mode Episode 6!- I was like -What? i didnt get a notification- I was about to punch a hole in my computer when it said $15 ♥♥♥♥♥ DOLLARS. Now let-'s hold on for a second. When i purchased this peice of poo, it said i would get ALL EPISODES so this prooves Telltale are abselout ♥♥♥♥♥ lyers and just want money.
