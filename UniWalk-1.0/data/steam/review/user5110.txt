the most fun i've ever had with 2 fingers . . . . . . . . . o_0  (that didn't leave a smell ) well worth $5  simple, but its not easy !so dam cool !  : )
i gave this a chance , any game in the Total war franchise deserves it . although what they were aiming for is what i wanted, please dont waste your time . it falls miserably short of anything enjoyable . when i heard about this i was excited . when i played this i was extremly dissapointed . i wanted to rage quit after 5 min . 8 seconds to build a dam to block an entire river .8 hours to harvest wood / wheat . o_0 . . . . . ♥♥♥♥♥ srs ???not to mention a bug caused me to start again with another account . . . . . and i also had to quit and rejoin multiple times to continue early story/guidence .Micro transactions destroy any kind of competition or fun in what you do as you progress through the game .anything can be bought , upgraded , fast built or gathered if you want to pay for it . DONT BOTHER .
Campaign is good, Enjoying playing through it. Great Playable Races ! , Diverse units and Buildings . looove the GOO ! . Great RTS
Suprising that a game released 10 years ago can ♥♥♥♥ on most these days . Grand strategy game . Awesome mechanics . Spy's , trading , diplomacy . And all for $2 . WORTH !
