Payday 2 is one of those games where you can muck around as much as you want or play as seriously as you want its all to personal preference. Payday is a first-person bank robbing ,meth cooking, painting stealing simulator and its extremely adictive.  With many different hiest to choose from, bank robbing to cocaine dealing you can aproach each mission in any way you like from equiping the heaviest armor and the strongest gun and going loud to rob a bank to going slow and steady in stealth which does come with a experience bonus. The game is very costumisable from choosing your armor, gun, mask all the way down to your melee. But out of the the costumising you will ever do is your mask whcich defines who you are with over 100 mask to choose from and over 100 different colours and patterns no one ever has the same mask.But all up its a very enjoyable game stealth, loud, with or without friends it dosen't matter the circumstances its a great game for those who enjoy co-op strategic shooter i recomend it to all for only 30 dollars its a great pick up. Yes i know i only have 6 hours on the game when i wrote this review but when the game first came out i played the hell out of it in XBOX 360
