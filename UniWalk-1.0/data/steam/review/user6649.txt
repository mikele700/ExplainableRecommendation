Recommended for potentialThe game still needs some more polish to be pleasantly playable. At the moment you cannot close your shop so that you may change some things around, instead you have to save your game then reopen it. This is the only major complaint; a smaller one would be that there are things that indicate features that just haven’t been added yet (for example a quest board with nothing on it).Now for the, as I mentioned earlier, potential. Some features that I feel would make the game much more interesting include:--tEmployees (people to sweep the floors or security).--tHero’s that enter your store and make custom requests for a quest they might have taken on. --tSome more random events ( e.g. people vandalizing your store)--tA store quality rating--tDecorations for your store (paintings, vases or chandeliers)--tSome more creative shop expansions (a second floor or balconies)Apart from all this I really can’t wait to see the future of this game and all it has to offer.
A great game to help you zone out while you listen to some music or a podcast.
I don't know why this game had me so invested in the story, but with every decision I made I felt a little worse about myself.P.S. The writing was funny and gripping.
Seriously, all this game needs are a few new game modes (or objectives) and I would be able to reccomend it to anyone.EDIT: Party system has been added, YAY!
A perfect game. Yes it's only 11 - 12 hours long but every second of it is top quality.
Valve quality level design, a new tool to play with and it's free. What more could you want?
The most satisfying sniper gameplay to date.
♥♥♥♥ing loved it.
Definatly worth the money I paid for the game!
