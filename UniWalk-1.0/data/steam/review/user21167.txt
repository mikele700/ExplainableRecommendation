I absolutely LOVE this game! The multiplayer on this game is by far the best I have come across. L4D2 is definately a team game and it works smoothly  when joining either a friends game or a random game.  The add ons from the workshop has made it easier to get some awesome custom material. I never tire playing the campaigns, it's one of those games that you play for hours and want to come back for more.  Well done! 9/10
