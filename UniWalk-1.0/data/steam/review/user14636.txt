Personally a huge fan of this game, great graphic, tons of content with more always being added, a fair currecncy that isnt pay2win and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Bewarned though the entire apeal of this game is the grind. If you are not a fan of the grind and the consistant gameplay loop than this is not the game for you. If however you are a diablo fan like myself and want to find a new experience to give that sense of satisfaction when you get a good peice of gear than warframe is most certainly the game for you.
Need a way to create a bonfire of headless bodies and then procede to put out the flames with your ♥♥♥♥, Postal 2 has itNeed a way to get ♥♥♥♥♥ by taliban chicks all screaming 'allah ackbar' at you because you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a grocer Postal 2 has itNeed a way to create a room filled with heads (refer to statement 1) Postal 2 has it
one of the best games i have ever played. It matches the openness of skyrim with the action of darksiders along with some interesting dlc.  I have to say it is one of the very few games that lives up to it's trailer.
