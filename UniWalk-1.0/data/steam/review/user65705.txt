Skyrim.... Where to start? Really, the greatest game in the Elder Scrolls series and possibly the best open world game around. Will keep you going for a VERY long time. Two things I really love are the endless combinations of items you can equip and the copious amounts of loot you can collect. I highly reccomend it.
Possibly one of the best games Ive ever played. When I say game, I mean completely out of this world, insane riduculous fun.
