-Shovelry isn-'t dead-Shovel Knight is an excellent 8-bit throwback with excellent music and fantastic gameplay. It brings back fond memories for all the OGs (old gamers) out there with Metroid-Legend of Zelda-Megaman like styles combined, and a Mario World like stage select. Even without any tutorial of some sorts it forces you to learn as you go along, and that-'s not a bad thing, as it kinda does it like Megman games do. This game is all about the skill of the individual and lacks anything that would seem OP.Also there is much to find and collect for you loot hunters (searching for that sweet booty).Overall the game is amazing and is perfect for anyone who wants a bit of a challenge or nostalgia rush.
