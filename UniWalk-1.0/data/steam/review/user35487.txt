There was a time when you first played as a Riflemen,Seriously Rifles are Balanced if you has eyes.I defended my points alone agains the whole team by hiding in the roof top and (High Ground) Everytime I try to shoot my enemies Body,I keep head shooting them.I hold up for 3 Minutes,untill my comrades arrive,I wonder what took them soo long...
this is why TF2 is more open that Call out Duty
This game is more like a hybird of Counter Strike and DOTA2,why?this game has some normal and unnormal things(Rocket jumping)it's also a good game,because even you're hacking you will be kicked from the serverit's more like Dota 2 because every class have weakness,like this:Snipers are good againts Heavy,Soldier,Demoman,and other,But weak againts scout pyro and spyHeavy are good againts pyro,and some class,but weak againts support class(Sniper,Spy,Even Medic)I totally recomended this game,it's also have different mode for some server,like Slender Man,Versus Saxton hale,Versus TF2 freaks,and Versus ponyville(Brony likes this server)some times when you died in a game you just angry right?,but in TF2 you maybe gotta get laughing because some funny pose/obious deaths.well,that's all.Kill meLater
