i've spent too much time and money on this game
An Uruk named Khrosh the Friendly killed me 4+ times, and was very polite when doing so.10/10
its pretty cool
Immediately immersive and continuous gameplay with no bounds, a great story, interesting and unique characters, tons of spells and weapons, and a huge selection of mods to add content and change the game.One of the greatest RPGs around. 10/10
Hilarious game, especially if you are a fan of South Park. The only down side is that it wasn't as long as I had anticipated it would be, but otherwise, great humour and unique combat. oh and you can fart on command. 10/10
Addicting and fun game. Although it's similar to terraria, it's very unique and broad in terms of content. And it's still in Beta!
Awesome game, very cheap, tons of free workshop addons and extremely fun to play with friends.
