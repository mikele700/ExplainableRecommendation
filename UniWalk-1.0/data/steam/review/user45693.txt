FTL is an amazing game which perfectly balances difficulty with enjoyability. There are many things to explore and it never gets old. Weapons and the different types of ships are always fun to try out as each needs a different strategy from the next. Many times you find yourself with the difficult decision of whether to investigate an empty ship or run away. Customisation is always fun especially when naming your ship and crew. I would highly recommend this game. One of the best indie games i've played.
