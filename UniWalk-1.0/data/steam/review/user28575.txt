Beautiful open world with even an even better combat system! I have completed the main storyline and im only 33% done with everything!
Great shooter! 9/10
This game is truly beautiful. Incredibly immense details on the surroundings and awesome storyline!
Skyrim is an incredible open world RPG. I've played hundreds of hours (offline mode) and i still haven't seen everthing let alone all the damn quests! It gets better with all the HD mods out there so be sure to install them! 10/10 Well played Bethesda well played indeed!
Awesome team orientated MOBA. Forget LoL, HoN, Smite and all the other trash games. I have tried them all, and stuck with Dota 2. Why? Well its ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, that's why! If you want a game to ruin your life this is it! 10/10
