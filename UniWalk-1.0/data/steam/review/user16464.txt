stand alone expansion that has the features that feel missing from this game to actually make it feel complete. A lot of features were either missing or feel clunky.This game had a lot of promise at the start but fell short. and then the expansion is just a slap in the face for anyone that brought this game early on expecting more to be added before this game was released as a completed game
