Although I prefered Fallout 3's atmosphere better, there is enough insanity, madness, quests and ENERY weapons to entertain yourself for a lifetime, I'm a massive fan of the fallout series because of it!
Was good initially, then the fps began to drop like everyone else which in turn stopped me from playing it altogether, unfortunetly fancy graphics and render distance was more of a priority then game performance. As a result a massive assassins creed fan like myself is now losing feelings towards the franchise because of it.
When you create a physics engine and place a ball and remote control cars you get this, such a simply yet entertaining game which actually promotes a competitive atmosphere. I have yet to get bored of this game and I feel like I've put so many hours already. Not to mention the fact that the developers still are creating new DLC to keep the game contemporary for everyone to enjoy themselves and have endless fun. Seriously a great game both casually and competively.
So many hours of my childhood wasted weilding a lightsaber as either a hero or villian in mos eisly conquest, this game is just used only as a nostaglia stimulate, but if your on the same page as I am then you need to get this game.k thx bye.
boobs....boobs everywhere
This game kicks you emotionally in the balls so much that you will start to cry out of your testicles.Tehn audda Tehn
Super hero game done right, seriously recommend even if your not a batman fan. But I found some missions to be a bit repeditive.
An amazingly thought out game, the amount of character development in this game makes anyone feel emotionly attached to all the characters on all level, with out a doubt one of the best games I've ever played, and remember to always protect Clem!
The most fun you'll ever have with a ffs online base game!
A fun simple game, much like minecraft but with new features and in 2D. is perfect for a low power runnig computer, much like mine.
