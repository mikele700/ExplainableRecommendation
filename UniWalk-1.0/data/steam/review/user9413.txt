This game is surprisingly fun. Good to work together in a team of 4 and organise a good heist. The gunplay is solid and the objectives are interesting enough to play a few times.
Kickstarted this game and boy am I glad I did! It's at it's core a platformer. But with so much to unlock I can see myself playing for many more hours. There are some cool powerups to be found on each randomly generated world with even more to be unlocked by playing through. The lore is told through randomly dropped logs from enemies and the backstory unfurling is quite an interesting one. Highly recommend this one.
A bunch of mindless fun. If you played the earlier ones this one takes everything even further over the top.
This game is a bunch of fun! Taking the regular RTS formula and speeding it up keeps it really interesting. Very easy to mod too which makes it last a little longer. Well worth the cash!
This game is like a side-scrolling version of minecraft! It's really fun and is updated very often. I've got a spare key for it too, so let me know if you want a copy*.*While stocks last!
Adds the one thing that Portal needed and that is multiplayer. The story continues and is wonderfully done, but the multiplayer makes this a much better game.
You really can't go wrong with a free game. This game is not only free, butis really well made. It's quality top-down style makes it a fun game to play. The ability to jump in grab 3 friends or randoms and have a game is great.
