♥♥♥♥ing Amazing but really a total mind♥♥♥♥ at the same time! Would recommend to anyone looking for fast-paced action, a well-crafted story and good characterisation all rolled into a ball wibly-wobly-timey-wimey-parrallely-universy stuff. Just pay attention to the detail, otherwise the ending will totally lose you and ♥♥♥♥ your brains out until you spend 3 hours on the wiki trying to sense of it.P.S. Your nose is bleeding ; )
