This game fuses comedy and first person shooters, this game is insured to keep you interested in playing for hours on end. There is a user friendly premium mechanic which allows you to become a premium member by simply purchasing something from the in-game store. This is actually one of the best mechanics I have ever seen. There are some items in the shop that sell for only 50 cents which is not that much financially. So basically pay 50 cents and get 300 more back pack slots and a hat. Upgrading to premium allows the player to find more items just by walking around a server shooting their friends in the face.
