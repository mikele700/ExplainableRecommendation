CS:GO is by far one of the best games I have played recently, It always seems to pull you back in, no matter how angry you are at the game. I recommend this game to most people that want to spend a buck or two.
Great game, some great moments, even though at the current point there a quite a lot of gliches/things I would change. Great graphics even on low, though you need a very good computer to run this ultra.Pros+ Everything except consCons- Cars stick to the road- Gliches that need to be fixed- Sometimes car spawning in co-op sometimes
