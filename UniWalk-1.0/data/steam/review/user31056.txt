I, which a lot of people will be angry at me. HATE THIS GAME. It's not even good? It may be 10 years old but the graphics are ♥♥♥♥. The story is utter crap, its just thrown everywhere I get handed a crowbar and then I go kill things constantly. This game is worse then call of duty, you constantly kill things and thats all you do. Its not diverse at all! You get a couple puzzles here and there but they are extremley easy and really pathetic, and obviously the game's story is not immersive at all! Go here, do that. Do that, go here. It's just repetitive and once again pathetic. People act as if this game changed how they sleep at night? How? I know so many other games that compared to this are better, more fun and actually give you bang for your buck. Some of these are: Pretty much any game on the PS2, GTA series, Red dead redemption, Far cry series, Mortal Kombat, Prototype, Battlefield series, there are so many games that absolutley crush this game and are a lot more fun. Plus how did this redefine shooters? What about DOOM, Red Faction and the original Call of Duty or Battlefield? Or even Duke Nukem? I feel as if everyone is brainwashed with this trashy game. This game is not worth $10 or even $5 its probably worth $1, because its a 1/10 for me.
