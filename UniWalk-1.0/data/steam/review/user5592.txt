I don't really got much to say about this game, I love the Saints Row franchise but this particular game is a bad PC port that is somehow worse than GTA4's PC Port!Regardless of how good your CPU & GPU is or how much RAM you have, you will experience stuttering and lagginess.If you going to buy this game, just be warned what I say & install the Gentleman of the Row mod, it fixes bugs, little performance fix & provides new content.Pros:+ Open World+ Bunch of Side Activities+ Customizable Features + Physics, who cares about physics?Cons:-Bad PC Port-Too Much WaterRemind if I made any mistakes, I would be appreciated if you can help the community and get the game running smoothly.7.8/10 ~ either Too Much Water or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Port ruined this beautiful game[knew I should've bought it for the Xbox 360]I recommend the game, not recommend the PC version.

This game is for free and these kinds of games are ok to pick up'You Have to Win the Game' is a game where YOU HAVE TO WIN ITIt's a platformer and the game is short (file) so you won't have too much space for your PCHowever I stop playing it because there's a level and I'm stuck in it and no matter what you have to force yourself to be a expert to it or in other words 'tryhard'I give it a 5/10 I haven't finish and I may never will
Just because this review is negative doesn't mean I hate the game, I'm having technical difficulties and just downvoting this review without even giving me a hand to fix it makes you a moron, please help me turn this review into positive by giving me solutions.The problem I'm having with this game is that it crashes whenever I attempt to start a new game or start benchmarking making It unplayable for me and that's unfortunate because I was really excited to play this game.As I said from this thread I made:I've done verify game cache, run the game as admin and use compatibility mode (both Win 7 & 8).Since I'm about to ran out of time, I have to refund this game because I can't just waste my money on something that is unplayable. It's a shame.Here's my specs: OS: Windows 10 (Upgraded from Win 8)CPU: AMD A4-5300 APU with Radeon HD Graphics (2 CPUs) -3.4GHzGPU: AMD Radeon HD 7480DRAM: 4GB (3.5 usable)Native Resolution: 1920x1080And hopefully you would comment and help me instead of downvoting this review just because it's negative. Thank you for reading if you actually did.
