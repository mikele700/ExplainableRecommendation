A lot of Fun! Well worth it! Will be interesting to see the content that gets added later! :)I've mainly played it Solo, BUT with mates/friends it will be a whole lot better. As a team, you can setup awesome fortresses with defensive perimeters and then as a group go on Raids to kill others and pillage all their gear! :)So, do I recommend this game? HELL YES!!
WAY better than Terraria!! Being able to explore different planets and fly around the solar system to other planets is just amazing.So YES, grab Starbound as soon as you can!! :)
Just get it! Simple!
This is one game you dont want to ignore! like all games it has issues (although in this case VERY minor issues!) BUT nothing that cant be fixed and tweaked!Forget Sim City. Forget Cities XXwhatever. This is the City Building game in which you can build MASSIVE cities and also make and add mods!So do yourself a massive favour and grab a copy of Cities: Skylines.
Definitly recommend SpinTires! Great fun as Singleplayer and simple Awesome playing Co-Op with mates!So go grab a copy today! This very minute! DO IT NOW!! :)
EDIT: The devs apparently have patched the game and for me now i dont have to run the game in Compatibility Mode! Im on Win7 64bit with an ATI R9 270 and it loads just fine and at 1080! WOOHOO!! :)_________________________________________________Firstly, Do i recommend this game? well, ATM, I will say Yes! It looks great and while I have only done the tutorials and not put much time into it, it looks like it will be an awesome time sink! :)Now, on to the part that nearly forced me to not recommend the game!Along with may others, I had the crash issue as the game loads! Usually an instant thumb down!BUT, For me the issue was fixed simply by finding the game .exe file (--Steam--steamapps--common--Industry Giant 2)  and then setting the Compatibility Mode to Win Xp Sp3. By doing this the game loads just fine and it loads in 1080!!The only other Compatibilty mode it loaded for me was in Win95 but I couldnt change the resolution at all because it just crashed.So, IF you have the game and it wont load, try what I posted and see if it works. A dev has said they are working on fixing the issue. I will update this review IF they fix it!
FINALLY ITS HERE!!!! :) Grab it while it's HOT!!!True it WILL have Bugs and it WILL at times be unplayable, BUT IT'S ALPHA! you cant expect it to be flawless.Hell, even full release games will play and have more bugs than this!!
IF your a fan of any sim game (especially ETS2) then this is a must buy! It plays very smoothly, the trucks look amazing and the scenery in ATS is just breath taking!Dont be put off by the fact there are only 2 trucks and 2 states as SCS is adding more FREE content soon and other DLC PLUS the modding community is going to be huge!So go grab a copy of American Truck Sim. There is plenty of truckin' to do and plenty of goods that need delivering!
Its an amazing game! All made by one person! :)Pro tip (yes, calling myself pro! :P): Pause the game straight away and assign 3-4 builders. Then get 4 houses, a fishing hut and gatherers cabin placed, then un-pause to let them build.  Then aim to get a woodcutter done as soon as possible, hopefully before winter! (NOTE: get the labourers to constantly cut down trees, stone and iron from the start for a good supply of resources!!)From that point on, its all up to you! Enjoy this truly EPIC game! :)P.S. the only VERY VERY slight blemish on this game is that you cant play co-op with a mate! But still, the game wasnt designed for it and thats how the Dev wanted it so absolutely no complaints. Also, the amount of hours you will sink into it will forgo this anyway! :)
Awesome fun game. Playing as a Dinosaur. What could be better? :D
