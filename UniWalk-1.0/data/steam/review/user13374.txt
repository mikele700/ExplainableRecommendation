This game... just *speechless*I highly recommend this game to gamers who tend to have a liking in FPS games.Just a quick tip, 90% of your Call of Duty skills will go to waste as you venture through this amazing gameCounterstrike Global Offensive requires a person with precision, fast reactions and also superficial hand co-ordination is essential.With a vast majority of guns, selections are endless, each with different skills needed.Love trading? CS:GO is very similar to Team Fortress 2 as a large majority of their gamers trade. Skins, guns and knives are a must have due to their -sexiness-Competition allows gamers to showoff their skills (AWP-'ing, Headshots etc), letting use their planning skills and applying them online with other people around the worldOverall, Counter Strike Global Offensive is a game where many gamers would enjoy, no matter who they are. It-'s fun, fast paced and most importantly, it never gets boring!
This is a game not made for popularity, but was made to touch your heart. This game has left me in tears, confusion and realisation that friendship is everything. This game places your decisions at the greatest limits and places you in a role where you must choose the right thing, but there will always be an action, for every reaction...
