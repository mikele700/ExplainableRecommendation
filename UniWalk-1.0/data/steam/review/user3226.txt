Great game. You need a decent computer to run it. But it is playable on a crappy plastic laptop. A definite buy. Everyone loves it. BUT VALVE FIX THE ♥♥♥♥ING HIT BOXES AND SOUNDS. As most of you know the hitboxes are ♥♥♥♥ing aids
Why buy cod bo3 when you can download a mod what is exactly like it? why buy csgo? This is the best game ever 1000/10
Just like CS:GO but free.Bad graphics though. This is a very good game. (this review is so short)
