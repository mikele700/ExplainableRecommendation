Simply one of the best games of all time! The level design is immaculate, travelling from a small spanish village, to a grand castle, and finally to a decrepit island facility. All this is perfectly paced, combining intense combat with a spattering of puzzles (which arent detrimental to the gameplay in the slightest), and no section feels drawn out or overly tedious. The musical score builds tension between battles, and a contributes to their intensity when they occur, resulting in an atmospheric experience. Enemy design is brillaint, with hordes of infected villagers, chainsaw wielding maniacs, and head-eating parasites (amongst many others), providing a unique gameplay experience based on thier varied traits, anilites, and the like. Finally, the weapon selection and ammunition distribution is one of the best things about it. At times, it is a genuhne conundrum over which weapon is better, and what to upgrade and when. No weapon (aside the uber expensive reward weapons for completing the game on the hardest difficulty) feel overpowered, and there is never a time at which one has enough ammunition to go on a blind rampage. The only negative I can produce for this particular version of the game is that the initial release has a few bugs, which are fast dissapearing thanks to Capcom's input.  Also it is advisable not to expect the graphics to live up to the hype. It is a 2005 game after all. Though they arent particuarly important, as the game is still brilliant aside.Thus concludes my rant.
