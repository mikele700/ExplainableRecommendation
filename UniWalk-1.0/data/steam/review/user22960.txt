This game is hella good. Clicker/Idle Dating sim that warms your heart :). First run-through is a bit hard, but once you prestige, it becomes SO much easier.Note, you don't have to leave your computer on for you to progress. It will just rack up tons of hours and make it seem like you have no life. RIP. (What happened to me) 9/10 Solid
