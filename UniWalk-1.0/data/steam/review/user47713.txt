List of things my kerbals have somehow survived doing - 1. Having a ridiculously close orbit with the sun 2. Taking gforce like a boss3. Partaking in a game of kerbal dodgeball (the dodgeballs are actually other kerbals) 4. Landing on a mun base but ending up blowing up 90% of the mun base and 100% of all life living on the mun base except the kerbal that was landing5. Upsetting the kraken6. Landing on jool 7. Using the kerbals as bowling pins8. Upsetting the kraken (again) 9. Spinning at an ungodly speed and then have the kerbal EVA out of the pod.10. Upsetting the kraken
