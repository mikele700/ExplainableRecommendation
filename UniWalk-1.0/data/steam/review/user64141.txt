Great game, especially when played with friends. Would definetely reccomend it to anyone wanting some hilarious co-op action. It isn't as fun when you're by yourself, but it is still a very solid single player puzzle game. 8/10
When I first played this game, I joined a server, got some wood, made some armour and weapons and then made a nice house. Then one day I was in the forest looking for food and some guy attacked me and killed me for my pants. This was fine, I got the rest of my gear back and then went to sleep in my house.When I joined again someone had killed me in my sleep and taken all my stuff.FML0/10EDIT***Nothing rusts
