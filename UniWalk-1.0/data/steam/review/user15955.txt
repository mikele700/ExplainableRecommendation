I had to edit the .ini file to stop the game locking up in Win 7 (Thanks steam forum), game works like a charm now.
Charming game packed full of content and replayability.  At $10 it is amazing value.  Three thumbs up (don't ask.)
Indie Steam-Punk Diablo clone ?  Theres nothing in that sentence I don-'t like.  If you like your plots thin and your gameplay 100% -kill everything that moves-, you could go a lot worse than Torchlight..
Portal 2 represents everything I love in gaming.  It entertained, it challenged and it rewarded.  A memorable experience crafted by the best in the industry.
Great game.  The next best thing to playing Fallout 1 & 2.
A classic Bioware game.  I like to think of KOTOR as Baldur's Gate 3 in Star Wars drag.  Simplified yes, but a lot of downtime that added nothing to the overall experience has been removed as well.Fast paced highly enjoyable game with a good story and interesting characters.  I wish they had made a movie of this game instead of the sad episode 1 to 3 we got instead.
Great puzzle game, similar to lumines.  Very addictive :).
