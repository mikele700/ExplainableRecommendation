It-'s probably the easiest one of these survival games to get into, mainly because of the whole -if you die, it-'s all over- part of it NOT being a part of Rust.
Honestly this game's story touched my heart in a way I never could have expected.I honestly think everyone, and I mean every single human alive today should play this game, the story and the soundtrack and characters... Pretty much everything just moved me, and I find it hard to believe that it wouldn't move everyone else. I definitely recommend this game. It's just amazing.*EDIT* It's also really freaking funnyNYEH HEH HEH!
DLCs overly exepnsive but other then that pretty ♥♥♥♥in good m8
You think you guys ♥♥♥♥ your pants?I have to clean my entire house, for christ's sake!
This game really made me feel. It's so well made and is just awesome. EVERYONE should play this game!
