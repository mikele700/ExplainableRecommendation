A lot of people are saying that this basically could have been a mod, and they-'re probably right. Others say that it doesn-'t fit the character of XCOM... and what, the Blowout Hair doesn-'t?  I feel that it really captures the -resistance spirit- of XCOM 2, and allows you to make some very interesting characters.Ultimately it-'s up to you whether a bunch of well designed props are worth $5 to you, but to me, it certainly was.
Despite the problems, I like this game, although i did buy it while it was only on desura and in really early alpha.
Wonderful Turn Based Tactics game already, but with the expansion, improves sevenfoldXCOM: Enemy Unknown: 9/10XCOM :Enemy Within : 10/10XCOM :Enemy Within With Long War Mod[www.nexusmods.com] : 13/10
Despite the bugs, I still reccommend this game, although you may have to cheat a little if certain bugs happen.
