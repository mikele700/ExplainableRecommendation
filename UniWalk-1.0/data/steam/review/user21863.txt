Amazing game, would recommend out of 10.vv This is mostly personal but it may helpful  ¯--_(ツ)_/¯ vvAfter the first few hours of playing this game, I found it way too tempting to just jump right into using the console commands. After previously watching many videos of people messing with the command window in oblivion when I had it on console, I really wanted to experience the item test halls and such.  I find my self playing this game for around 5 hours then loosing interest, leaving the game and coming back after a long period of time.For me the main quest was too short and the ending was like a big build up to nothing but a -Hey... great job-If I go back to when I just started this game. I would play it again with the hardest difficulty locked on + disabled command window.  I do feel kind of ashamed that I dont find this game as great as I should find it.This could be just from the fact that ive played Elder Scrolls IV to death. Playing Skyrim actually makes me feel like going back and playing Oblivion for some odd reason.
