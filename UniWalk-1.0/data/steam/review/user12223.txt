MEME DOG? Indeed, I believe so.
So I've been putting off doing a review of Planetside 2 for a while now, but with the population dwindling despite the new dev team's stalwart determination to keep the game alive, I feel like now is the time. It is also the best time to play the game - the balance is the best it's ever been, and the content updates are more frequent than ever.Don't be fooled though, the game is dying, so if you want to play it and still get the proper full scale experience, you should really think about doing that now. All that aside, the gunplay is solid, the customisation is good, the microtransactions don't lend to a P2W environment, subscriptions are definitely worth it, the maps are huge and the battles epic. The netcode can take a little while to get accustomed to. It's not that it's bad though, just that concessions had to be made due to the scale of the game. For what it is, the lag is generally quite minimal. The only caveat is the minimum system requirements - though I'd wager anyone who has built a gaming PC after 2014 should be able to run the game with some degree of success - and if the in game settings fail you, there are a heap of great .ini tweaking guides to help you squeeze every last drop of performance from you rig.TL;DR - It's ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic, play it now, before it's gone.
MEME DOG? Never doubt it.
