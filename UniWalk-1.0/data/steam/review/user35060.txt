If You have the money to buy the game, thats good but be aware that the amount of DLC that is required to enjoy the game is way to many. the DLC alone will end-up costing more than the game itself. I think it WAS a good game but now it just costs too much to keep up with the DLC.If you have the money, it is a very worth-while game. however if you don't have a lot of money to put towards the game, i recomend you keep looking
