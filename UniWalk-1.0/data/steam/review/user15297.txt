Many of the reviews I have seen are straight to the point of it being 'short' and in regards to finishing it, I have to agree. But with the quite short time I had with this game, the finishing time didn't matter, it's the experience that matters. Seeing the boss for the first time and wondering what made it trigger, getting instantly squished, impaled, melted or vaporised (respectively), staying back to discover the attack pattern of the boss (while being assaulted with vines, fists, icicles, magical arrows of death etc,)  getting enough courage to take shots between attacks and finally taking it down. All of this was what makes this game great. Regarded, I still havent versed the majority of the bosses, but the ones I did fight were quite a challenge with the final fight making me physically gasp and then punch my fist in the air with joy when I finally took it down. I plan to go back to this game in the future.9/10
