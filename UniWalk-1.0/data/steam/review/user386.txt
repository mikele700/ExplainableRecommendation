Dayz, what a broken game.It is only fun if you are playing with friends that can take the p*ss out of it, but if you don't have extra money to buy friends, you may want to aviod this.Dayz is poorly optimised, has texture pop in, zombies having the amazing ability to hit you from 100ft away and walk through walls (one of them must be god) and picking the right moment for the game to crash on you.The devs put the servers under maintenance but do f*** all to fix the game. The game is still in early access and will probably stay like that until the real apocalypse happens.
Probably one of the best games of 2016 so far (for me that is). Yes it is a -walking simulator-, but it was one of the best stories that i have played in years. You really want to engage with Henry as he did certain things that I-'m not going to spoil.The art style of the game is amazing. The orange sunset really pop-'s out and make everything this amazing orange colour (they make good wallpapers).Now, it terms of gameplay, there isn-'t much. You just walk around the map doing things and walking back to yout tower. That is the only thing I didn-'t like about Firewatch, Otherwise it is a great game that you should play.9/10.
