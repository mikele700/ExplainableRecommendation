War of The Roses is a challenging, but intruigung game based on the England's 13th century civil war of the same name. Difficult to become accustomed to but remains infinitly enjoyable as you continue to, 'paint your foes red'. I see it as a Medi√¶val Call of Duty, as it follows a similar game structure, though the gameplay is quite different. The ability to compose your own casses is certainly a highlight of the game, with a diverse range of weapons and armour unlockable throughout the game. The game is in need of many improvements, but nonetheless I remained to find it an amusing waste of 200 hours of my life!
