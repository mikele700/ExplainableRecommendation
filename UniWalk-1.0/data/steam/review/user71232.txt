Portal 2 is a great game created by Valve. You are basically a guinea pig (test subject) who is a girl named chell. And in the previous game portal the machine that created these puzzels and tricked you and tried to kill you is named GLaDOS. You eventually kill her. Well in portal 2 you are still playing as the original character chell and was in a room where you would be picked for later testing. But a robot came alon named wheatley who comes along and helps you out and you come across GLaDOS turned. but of course wheatley does something stupid and you have to fight her again going through 19 puzzles. And when you defeat her wheatley is now in charge and GLaDOS's intelligence is now in a potatoe which you carry around with you because wheatley through you two down a hole. And as you travel through the underground you come across the first testing chambers and find a story that you will have to find out for yourself. But in these testing chambers your using gel. The blue allows you to jump higher, the orange to move faster and the white allows you to create portals where it has touched. (Oh and when you get to chapter 6 you will find a achievement realating to half life. BORIALIS). And at the end you send wheatley into space and your sent out into a wheat field. I recomend this game to everyone. Now youre thinking with portals.
