There are a lot of bad glithes in this game but other than the leaving games problems, this game seems to have potental to be one of the best games out there. Besides Battlefield 4, Arma 3, DayZ Standalone...
After 170+ hours, still haven't ranked up to Master Guardian.....Still very addictive though!
If you like ninjas who go on awesome missons? This is the game for you...
