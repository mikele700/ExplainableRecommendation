A great game its open world and well i could go on for ages because its a awesome game
All and all its a great game with all different kinds of characters with different personalities but the only down side is that its a bit hard to do all the controls with a keyboard or that may just be me
Transistor is a absolutly beautiful graphics and story line and the gameplay is amazing 10/10 would deffinantly reccomend I absolutely love this game its my personal favourite game of all time and i hope other enjoy it just as much as me but i just love everything this game has to offer
I absolutlely love this game its very unique in the fact there are different enemies and the sense of lonelyness give the game even more reason to survive and the fact that gun arent that easy to find is good because it make you more determined to find them I love the game 10/10
Warframe is a absolutle perfect game and its just amazing because it have great game play the otion to solo or play with others if you get stuck and sure it takes a little getting used to but honestly its worth the time to play and even on low graphics the game still looks absolutely amazing so 10/10 would recommend and the best part its free :D
This is a great MMORPG for anyone looking for a good free to play one on steam itll take a bit of getting used to and the only down side is that there isnt much character creation and things are gender locked but still its a great game 10/10
Its a great game has a lot of realistic perspectives to it and for most heists it gives you the option to stealth it and not even have to fire a bullet or just go in guns blazing and the best part you earn heaps of money :D
Dont starve is a great survival game very realistic in some cases some of the down sides are it has no multiplayer and a perma death system so if you have worked really hard and die thats it but over all i give it 9/10
