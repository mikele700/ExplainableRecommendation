I've had a few hours of gameplay and I heavily enjoyed it but crashes and launcher errors prevent me from playing the game. The game itself is not problem, it's the launcher that can't seem to do anything without getting an error. I reinstalled three times to no avail and it has become frustrating. I would love to recommend this game but until Zenimax get their act together and solve these launcher issues (that have been plaguing users since release) I won't be doing that.
