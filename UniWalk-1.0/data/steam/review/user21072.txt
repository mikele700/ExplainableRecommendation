Its honestly the first game ive ever considered doing a pacifist run on.And its funny, because now im never gonna do a homicide run. Its just to jarring to think about.Its not a long game but its 10/10 worth buying if you havent already had it spoiled. But even then, theres a ton of stuff you can discover.
Do I honestly need to recommend this?
