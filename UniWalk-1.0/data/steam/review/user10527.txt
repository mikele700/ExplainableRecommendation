Just tried out space rift and i gotta say i have played alot of vr sims, vr space sims, they were all good and immersive but more like demos, space rift is the first that has a story good voice acting comfortable background music and immersive ,i highly reccomend this to anyone with vr headgear 10/10 can,t wait for the next episode keep up the good work can't wait for episode 2
I finally after 5/6 years uninstalled Deus ex H.R,and i didnt want to write a review until i had some hours on deus ex mankind divided so on fathers day i got mankind divided started playing early i literally played 12 hours straight (awesome fathers day) i am loving it, great game so far, i can't complain about the story cause its pretty good  and graphics- the game runs smooth on maxed out settings and looks awesome  i have read alot of negative reviews about mankind  divided, don't believe the hype on those neg reviews try it for yourself i run an i5 ,12 gig gtx titan x and dont have any problems running it. cant wait for mankind divided to update for  directx 12 its gonna look even more amazing then what it does now i have been a fan of Deus ex since 2000 and for anyone that loves cyberpunk Deus ex M.D is exactly what your looking for 10/10
if you like an immersive futuristic dystopian cyberpunk story that you can walk around in realtime with a vr headset then you will enjoy the hell outta this game, probably so far the most enjoyable vr experience i have had, and i have had afew , awesome music retro arcade games it does give the desired affect of feelin/being there i use the dk2 and i read some comments about this game not having immersion ,but you can change that in the options of the game to give yourself full immersion and i can tell you i played to the end and was literally walking around realtime feeling like i was actually in adam jensens room from deus ex this games pretty surreal i recommend this game to anyone that has a vr head set,loved the experience still lovin it
Been waiting a long time for a new doom release, i gotta admit its a breathe of fresh air (nostalgia),the campaign is loads of fun and so replayable the demons are looking like the classic doom demons from doom 1/2 im lovin it .the multiplayer kinda reminds me of many other ones out there but what makes this stand out from the pack  ............ITS FRIGGIN DOOM 10/10
i finally played it ,i wasnt expecting much from it but pretty scary the old graphics didnt ruin it at all it made it creepier great sound and for me it was very immersive 11/10 would shoot children with knives in the face again
 what i can i say,if your looking for that alien isolation/soma immersive fear that you will hide yourself inside a locker for hours to scared to come out .......then this game is definetley for you . the A.I is good ,i also reccomend trying it with oculus dk2 i mean WOW it messes with your perception and you feel like your really creeping around a rusted up ship in the middle of nowhere .......alone . with use of the oculus i rate it a 12/10, but running it in 2D i rate it 10/10 great game
what can i say but WOW ,the Witcher 3 is a great game am  loving playing this game its actually quite a large map to cover so much to do in this game will write final review on completion........i completed the game and now am playing new game + with dlc i might quit my job FOR I AM GERALT OF PLOUGHIN  RIVIA
its been a long time i might re-install and re-rage again 10/10
What can i say , it runs so smooth it plays so damned well on max settings on the GTX TITAN i did really like the 2715 resolution until the update put its highest res 1920,1080 but other than that 11/10
