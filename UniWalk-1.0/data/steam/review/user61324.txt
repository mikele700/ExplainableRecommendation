Because of zombies maps and gameplay, the multiplayer map design(some could be better), The guns are balanced(mostly) and the Camos for the guns are just EPIC!!! The campaign could have been better( a lot better) and zombies could have had more maps. Like if there was 1 in every dlc ( there is one in all but 1 or 2). All round, Great Game. GET IT!!!!
YES. This game is great. definately the freshest cod in the franchise since Cod4. The campaign was epic if not a bit too short and the MP is awesome. Great maps and awesome gameplay comign from the exosuits. The only downside to the multiplayer, is that they need to either change it from skill based matchmaking to connection matchmaking or GIVE THIS GAME FREAKING DEDICATED SERVERS. overall. Worth buying, really great new ideas brought in by sledgehamr but it wont be the best cod. UNTIL the add dedicated servers.
