This is the most buggiest, laggyiest peice of ♥♥♥♥ game i have ever played. The trailer shows you what you can do however infact you cant even do half the ♥♥♥♥ in that trailer. Being spawned in the middle of no where is not ♥♥♥♥ing fun either. This game has been in Alpha for almost a ♥♥♥♥ing year. A ♥♥♥♥ing $5 cooking simulater would be better then this garbage. Should you buy this game?... ♥♥♥♥ NO!
