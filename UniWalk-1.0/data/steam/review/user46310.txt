This game's story will blow your mind I'm not even joking + awesome gameplay
So much Fun just pure Fun
Short but sweet, Great teaser for the next game in the series
Words can't even began to describe how Beautiful this game is, Best story driven game I've ever played
Was playing for like an hour and 1/2 logged off server for like 5 mintues to get something to eat IRL came back, a Castle had been bulit right next to me and it turned out my New neighbours were a Nudist Hatchet weilding Cult needless to say I got ♥♥♥♥ed in the ♥♥♥. 10/10 they used Lube so It was still good for me
