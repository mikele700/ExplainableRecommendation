Awesome Game so far, I managed to run it on Intel HD 4600 integrated graphics with my i5 4460 CPU and I could run it on normal at 25fps, still looks awesome. Story Mode is enthralling, even though I have played it before on Xbox. So much to do, it never gets boring unless you have an unimaginative mind, no friends or you are playing it 24/7. Only thing that sucks is hackers setting you on fire as soon as you spawn, taking away weapons and blowing up your awesome cars and making you pay insurance prices. Overall, awesome game! 9/10 IGN - Much use of 'awesome', many sighs.
The servers are broken, hackers flying at Mach 0.1 speed, machine guns shoot 3000000000000 bullets per second, sniper machine guns, modders, hackers, cheaters, toxic community with pre--pubescent voices creaming down the mic, keep falling through the world, spawn ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and everything is broken.Uninstall button is the only thing that works.10/10
