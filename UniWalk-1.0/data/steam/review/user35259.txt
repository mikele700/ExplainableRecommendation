Farming Simulator: Interplanetary Edition
It's pretty frustrating that there's no option to display the music as sheet music or tabs. It feels like more effort is being put into learning how to read music a la guitar hero than being put into learning the songs themselves, and for what? Sure, if you're a complete beginner and like how easy it is to get into then maybe, but otherwise just buy a book and learn.
Horrendous performance even with the lowest graphical settings makes aiming a continual frustration.

Great art design and setting. The RPG elements hardly hinder the FPS elements. The game can be very drawn out and more like a sandbox if you play it that way. The co-op definately compliments this. It's always better with co-op, ideally with a group of trusted players, all in the same room that have 48 hrs (for the completionist) or less to kill.
