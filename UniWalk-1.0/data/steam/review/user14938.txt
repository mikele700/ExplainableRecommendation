Great Documentary!
It definetely needs some getting used to from the epic original The Binding of Isaac but nonetheless... This is an epic upgrade on visuals and on the game engine itself - I have been able to run the game much longer than the original without performance issues and a solid fps! :D
This is a nice MOAB game.I prefer it to LoL for it's originality and interface but that is just my personal opinion.I highly recommend this game!
