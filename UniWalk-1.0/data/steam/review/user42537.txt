I never was a big fan of the Half-Life series, I especially though this game was decent at least, but other people seem to call this -the best FPS ever- and -one of the best games ever-. Personally, I just thought the game was mediocre.The gameplay is nothing really that special, it-'s a first person shooter, and a very simple one at that. I do like the range of weapons, from pistols to rifles to shotguns, and you can carry them all at one, so there is a lot of variety, much like Bioshock. However, the puzzles are extermely straight forward and the vehicles are so finicky, I press the D key for a millisecond and the entire boat goes in a 90 degree angle, the gameplay was just simple and nothing special. It just got boring for me in the end.The graphics weren-'t bad, for 2004 they look quite good, but to today-'s standards, they are a bit outdated to today-'s standard-'s like Infamous Second Son and the new Wolfenstein. Also I didn-'t care for the story or the character-'s for that matter, especially Gordon Freeman. He is possibly one of the boring video game protagonist. He is basically just there as a object of plot, he could be more intersting if we actually heard him speak, but he is just boring. People say that he is like Link from the Legend of Zelda, but the thing with Link is you can see his facial expreesions and see how he is feeling, making him more developed, Freeman is blank with no word of dialouge and no face in game. He is not a charactter, he is an object.Personally, I don-'t like this game, because of the high critical acclaim it got, and it had a very sour payoff. If you like this game, that-'s fine, go ahead and play it, but for me, I-'ll pass when Half-Life 3 eventually comes out.
