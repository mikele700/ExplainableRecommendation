Don't play league if your the type of person that loves abit of a challange. Not some easy type of gameplay provided by Leage of ♥♥♥♥ (League of Legendens). Dota 2 (Defense of the Ancients 2) requires skill, sportsmen ship, cooprative, teamwork and most of all F.U.NPlay with friends or make friends in the wide community and devolop skill. This game sucks at first BUT when you start to have a go at it, its the best thing that has ever happended to your life...When i first tried this game, I HATED IT. Then after watching Dota 2 reporter i started to realise how fun and enjoying Dota can be.At first i was called a NOOB for not playing the game right. Then i asked if i could party up with some people that i met in my team. They gladly invited me then i was apart of a little group of dota 2 players. Two in particular abused the hell out of me, but i kept on going and now. Ive passed the three stages of DotaStage 1: U SUCK AT IT    Stage 2: U STILL SUCK      Stage 3: Oh your good...... BUT U STILL SUCK#Dota2isbetterthanalltheotherMOBA's
Rust, a game that is mixed with Minecraft and the zombie mod Dayz. This game is great with friends when building and raiding other peoples bases. You start off with a stone rock (as a tool or weapon), medi-kit and a torch. Get this game and you will be playing for along time with your friends (alot of friends playing is a good defense) and other players.
Man so aswsome when i say aswsome i mean it!(Scout) *BONK*
