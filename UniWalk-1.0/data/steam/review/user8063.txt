Amazing side scrolling, 2.5d game. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a change from most other next gen games. But before you buy this game and rage in reviews because it’s different to the other Assassin's Creed titles, read the description so you understand what you’re buying before you buy it. Over all it’s a great game although I would like to see a 3d Assassin's Creed based in China, but I’m looking forward to the next 2 Chronicles. Also what else could you asks from a game, you get to run around and kill Asians.
This Game Is BS It Wasted All The 22 Bloody Minutes Of My Life And My Computer Cant Even Run It It Needs Such Good Graphics And It Costed So Much. The Open World I Horrible And No One Likes It Besides The People That Do.JKsPS Im Not One Of The People That Like It
