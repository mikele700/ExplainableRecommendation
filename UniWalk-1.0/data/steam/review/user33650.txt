Pants: Optional.Tenouttaten
Make it available in more places around the world. There's not much that I can add to this controller that hasn't alreayd been said. It doesn't replace a controller, it doesn't replace a keyboard, but it adds a whole new dimension to couch-gaming that was previously inaccessible to people with wired peripherals.For $49USD it's a decent deal. For $80AUD it's a ripoff however.
