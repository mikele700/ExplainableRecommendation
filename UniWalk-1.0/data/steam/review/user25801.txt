this game suffers from only a few problems these problems are the lack of people. At the start when it was cheep there was alot of people but now there is none i only hope more people will eventually get this game.problem 2. sence there is near to none servers. the NA servers have the more people but you suffer the lag.problem 3 the price $15 for a game thats been out for over a year this is not good.but there is good this game is 10/10 concepts with 10/10 ships and fights i felt as if i was captian killing people as a viking sailing the high winds (or sea's) this game if only it had more people playing it would be better i think the dev's should look at problems and fix them as this is a good gmae just needs more love
yes its good for the average player and its an aplha so give it sometime
The Best Film EVERRRRR
