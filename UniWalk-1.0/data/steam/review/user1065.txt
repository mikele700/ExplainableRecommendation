If you are kind of person that likes sci-fi and strategy? Well this game is perfect for you! I really enjoy playing this game so much that after playing I still keep thinking that I was there in the ship itself fighting the rebels, pirates and some confused aliens! Plus the game is cheap. Worth the money in buying the game. Eventhought the game may not have the over the edge graphics but they have their own art style that fits with its gameplay. Don't forget the music soundtrack they are awesome!
