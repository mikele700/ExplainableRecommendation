Very addicting. Very good. Very fun. 10/10.Worst part is, I keep getting this error when starting the game! Please help! (The error is #1033, it's been happening for a week now)
Team Fortress Two. A funny, cartoon-looking game. COD, BattleField, may be better but this game is just to fun! 10/10 :D
S**** game.Thats all i need to say.
Great game, really fun to play with friends. The DLC is a little overpriced, but you can still have fun without it. Loads of content, really fun once again. :)
Pretty good, don't recommend buying this game in early access though. It has great potential in the future, cant wait too see it! :D
