actually wanted to kill my self
Good game, Would be better if i didnt get Errors when launching the game after every update. Someone halp!
Best game in the world!
cool
Horrible 0/10 IGN Its better playing on my ps3 than the pc and i even have a gtx 960 map doesnt even load properly and the Mulitplayer doesnt work. 
Dis game is pretty good i love how realistic the car physics are and when people hide in a bush and shotgun u but the best part is hackers and team killers. XDDDDDDDDDD
Okay
