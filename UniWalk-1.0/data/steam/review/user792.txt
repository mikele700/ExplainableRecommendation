For a idle game its pretty good. Very easy and not a lot of strategy. 10/10
The game is absolutley amazing. With mods you can make this game just amazing. The work that bethesda put into this game is out of this world.
For a walking simulatlor it is very well done. The graphics are very good. The story is so good you don't even realize that you are playing a game. 10/10 would buy again.
A absolute great game. Gameplay is very well done. Grahpics aren't the greatest, but dont judge a book by its cover, am i right? Would highly reccomend this game to anyone who loves medevil games.
Great game
