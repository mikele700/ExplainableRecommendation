A very disturbing game considering there are countries like this in existence. I found it disturbingly amusing and sometimes odly   emotional, especially when you get attached to a character or you're visited by certain people. There are many different endings and I have only found a few, every ending differs in brutality and are quite realistic (Don't expect any miracles to save you.) This game requires a large amount of focus identifying discrepencies between passports and other information so if you're expectaing a casual, fun sort of game, then you should look elsewhere. If you play games that give you a large sense of achievement with; an intimate storyline and characters, that adapts to your every move, by all means purchase this game.Glory to Arstotzka.
A great side scrolling shooter. The gameplay really takes me back to games like R-Type Delta where the difficulty is incredibly high but very satisfying. The game is graphically pleasing with the entire universe being drawn out of ball point pen, however there is a sharpness lacking at 1366x768 resolution. I would suggest running in window mode. However, this does not take away from the amazing amount of gameplay time that comes for under $10. I estimate around 20 hours for full completion. Be warned that this game is highly addictive and may cause you to lose track of time altogether. Overall, 8.5/10I am eegerly awaiting a sequal with more and more challenging levels. Great stuff.
