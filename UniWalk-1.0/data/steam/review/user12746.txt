Trash. The games repetitive levels, lack of checkpoints and 'twitch' platforming combine to create system that punishes you severely for dying even once, and just gets worse and worse from there. An exercise in extreme tedium masked by the pretty aesthetics and retro vibe. I've never lost interest in a game faster.
