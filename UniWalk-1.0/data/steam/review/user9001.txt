This version of Dirt is the best one yet. I enjoyed the previous iterations for what they were, but this is something else. Very realistic and very enjoyable. Pure rally, no nonsense (gymkahna, rally x). 10/10 would recommend.
Early Alpha version and has ridiculous potential, and many issues, but fun factor is 10/10.
