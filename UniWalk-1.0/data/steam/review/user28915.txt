very god game but i realy do think that you need a controler(which is bad as i dont have 1:( ) but i rate it 10/10 because the graphics and the gameplay is awesome! i rate this game to anyone who likes FOOTBALL or SOCCER (for aussies and americans).
VERY FUN (thats it folks)
it is a very awesome+good game and have never witnessed lagg
realy laggy and is not that good when it comes 2 the tutorial but over all its realy good if it does not lagg/crash (btw its realy hard 2 close)
played it for something like 2 hours but is very good when u play with FRIENDS
Very AWESOME game !!!! recomend it very much!!!
