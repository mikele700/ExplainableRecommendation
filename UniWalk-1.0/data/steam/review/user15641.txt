a zombie scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.
I bought the extened edition on another account then sent the extended edition to this account. i did not recieve any of the current DLCs with it only Karts. Game is great just has flaws to things like the $15 DLC packs.Come on Bohemia you're not EA stop being money hungry.
Not enought hats2/2 hats would not play
i ran around naked for a hour.
i killed a dragon, fell of a mountain, a thief tried to rob me when i was wearing daedric armor, a mudcrab pinched my balls... Best...Game...Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
