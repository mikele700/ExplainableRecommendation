Glory to Arstotzka.
Im a fan of South Park and this game is incredibly authentic and well made. Highly recommend. Also if you are in AU like me follow the guide in the community hub to avoid playing the low violence version. And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche.
This game is simply awesome. Fast paced action with a great story. From the artwork to the level design and themes it is so well done i havent enjoyed a single player fps this much since i was a kid playing duke nukem 3d. The sword play in this game is the best. I thouroughly enoyed the progression and perks you gain along the way as you develop Lo Wang so if you've ever wanted to slash demons and kill your ruthless boss this game is a must.
