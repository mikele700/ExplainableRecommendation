love this game. the gathering people for your party, doing quests or tasks, taking over things. also i made Jon Snow's legacy live on through it  D:
i love all the games in the borderlands series, this one for me is especially awesome because its more immersive the characters talk to you specifically. Moxxi is still here btw thats also why ;). its a great game i would recommend to people.:D
