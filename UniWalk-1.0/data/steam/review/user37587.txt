~ One of my fav games ! ~Love the graphic style :)
Nice Game :)
Good Game :D
Good survival horror game :)Blood Everywhere XD
Outstanding ! It combines much of Assassins Creed good parts with the Batman franchise type of fights! The storyline is solid and magnificent, the villains and characters are truly well fleshed out, sidequests are fun to play as well and it's well optimized on PC.
My fav game so far !!Love it !
