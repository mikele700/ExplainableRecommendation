Must play1337/10Amazing game
Niko! It's your cousin! Let's go bowling. But seriously, on to the review.This game is basically a rollercoaster of emotions. Also, it's a good bowling simulator if you like those types of games. But seriously, gameplay was great, although a bit laggy, I fixed this problem via lowering my graphics, which didn't bother me. I highly recommend this game. Also, most of the negative reviews are probably Windows 8 users.
This game is quite good and bad at the same time, but if you ignore the bad stuff, it's a fun game. Although the puzzles start off very easy, they get harder if you go along,
