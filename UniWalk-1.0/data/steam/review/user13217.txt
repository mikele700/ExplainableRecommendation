This game is great, 10/10 I love this game mainly becasue it puts you in the shoes of a real time futuristic soldier. The combat in this is exceptional and is very realistic. I would certainly try this :)
This is a fun game although because it is a military simulator it can get a little boring. Overall it is a great game :)
12/10This is the best game i have currently played, the audio in the game is unreal. Combat is different every time and extremely intense. If you like Mil sims that are actually fun buy this game.Cant really explain the experience until you have played it.
Great game :)
One of the best games i have played 11/10 :)
This game is a great FPS. It is by far one of the best shooter games i have played and the customization for the weapons and the player is just amazing. It took me a bit of time getting use to the controls and the fast paced action but overall i rate this game 5/5 :)
Great game, love it!!!
This game is great especially when it is only $20. It has a addictive storyline and the things you can do in this game is great.I recommend this game to any gamer.
