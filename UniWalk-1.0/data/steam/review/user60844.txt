DayZ is probably one of the most played open-world Zombie games to date. It was one of the most successful mods in history, and although the standalone isn't looking so crash-hot now, it's definetely headed in the right direction. My advice would be to buy this game right now, even if your not really happy with the current build.I only say this because the difference between the mod and this game is vastly different, and as such the developers are trying to take this in a more realistic direction. This won'tbe agreeable to everyone, of course, and sometimes I think they've taken it too far, and retracted from the game's appeal. Despite what I know they're aiming for, I think they have to consider that this is JUST a game, and shouldn't be crafted to a point where the community no longer enjoys it. Nevertheless, I'd recommend it time and time again as a great away to pass the hours with friends, through blood, sweat and tears. (Usually in that order).
