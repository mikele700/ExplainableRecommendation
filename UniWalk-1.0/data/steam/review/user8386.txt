Welp, the games amazing. One big problem, multiplayer's already ded. R.I.P
I'm quite mixed between Yes and No. The games buggy as ♥♥♥♥, I had built a hunting shelter, fire pit and was completely surrounded by defensive walls (Almost). I was one wall away from being done when I got stuck between my shelter and a wall. A over bloodthirsty native found me and started beating from the other side of a wall :/ I understand this is Early Access, but thats really dissapointing. -_- Other than that great graphics and I love the survival side of the game. I would be more than happy if they added a nativeless mode...
Meh, roleplay has never been somthing I've been into, but they turned the game into a open-world shoot first reload previous save simulator. Great graphics and world design most areas are really memorable.
Ok I might be over reacting...  But this game is down-right offensive/embarrasing... Ok so 2k Australia helps make it then suddenly every single character (except for a few) have a stupid Australian stereotype attitude? To make it clear I-'ve lived in Australia since I was born and I haven-'t heard -G-'day cobber- or even -G-'day- since I was born, this is offensive to say the least. Anyway RedBelly as a play on NedKelly? Who is meant to know that outside Australia?Also why the pointless platforming? I feel like theres actually no real use for it other than set up specific areas...Also, I found I was leveling slower than the game side missions or not. I had to waste my time going back or attempting boss battles again and again. I was always 4-5 levels lower.And of course the moon zoomies... Gah, its like driving a car in constant accelerationI mean whats better than trying to turn then flying of a cliff, only to fly off lose $6000 to $10000? (in my case) WAIT TILL ITS ON SALE Oh and of course, I-'m in Australia, which means i-'d payed extra due to USD. Total price? $80 -_-
I love this game; the graphics are great, mechanics on point, captivating story and amazing cutscenes.However if you want to experience the story I suggest playing beginner or be ready to put the game downfor a while.9/10
 This is a shining example on what to not buy. Im sorry to anyone offended, however this is from my point of view and how they weakly attempted to supply anything new or making matchmaking pointless. Single Player  Great!I-'ve always taken a liking to campaign-'s of the various CoDs.I liked how interesting characters were reoccuring and didn-'t leave you with stoney silences.Seeing as just like every game, your character is mostly mute.I however found that these new exo movements were magically selected for missions that specifically had those obstacles. Also, how they were mostly used on one mission then discarded for the rest of the game...It had interesting cut-scenes ingame and premission. Multiplayer  Terrible... (Taking Exo survival into account)When suddenly I remind you, not everyone has 1mb download luxuries.Wow, its really come far! As in from a UAV spamfest to a Asm1 spamfest.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ So about the other part of -MultiTeamDeathPit- Is what I currently call multiplayer, TeamDeathmatch is the ONLY played gamemode except Mosh Pit.Making most daily challenges, more challenges of you patience...Weapons:The asm1s...Lazers... plz no.Positives:Item drop system, everything found is completely free. Looking at you TF2/Hat Sim.Upcoming Zombies Gamemode! Short version! SP: Great; Interesting plot & characters. Nostalgic to older games.Multi: Bad; Doesn-'t cater for bad internet. Dissapointing, as usual. Silly -Exo moves-Final Statement: Im reading up on the new CoDs before I buy them from now on.
I DEFINITELY reccomend this game. It has all the real aspects of a zombie apocalypse and the music really helps the player immerse him/herself in a world with a broken down society. Battle depresion, hunger, thirst, fatigue and a world of zombies. This is no ordinary zombie game as in -Walk around shooting zombies in a silly massacre and be rewarded with Game Over- *Cough* Cod zambs *Cough* *Cough* I over all think this game is great for a WIP Game. :D
Pros I had the time of my life playing this game, there is no shortage of new game-modes to try. Cons, this game can suck up more money than you might have payed for the game when it wasn't free, grip you cash tightly or you will watch it dissapear before your eyes! The game is a money grinder so watch out...
The Survival game types are rare and boring, however this game gave me a 3 hours worth of fun! It was fun to see if you could survive the night. It updates frequently, somtimes every 15 days!   *Unlike Minecraft!*  10/10!  Amazing!!!
