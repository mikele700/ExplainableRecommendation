Just like real football, this game takes you through a rollercoaster of emotions. Having owned many previous editions of Football Manager, this version is fairly similar to the last. However, FM is a great game franchise that I will continue to buy it because of its complexity. Not only do you manage the transfers and game tactics, you have to manage player satisfaction, club confidence, club finances, board expectations and scouting. Overall, FM is one of the most comprehensive simulators I have ever played and I will continue to put hundreds of hours into it because of how fun and detailed it is.9/10 - IGN (it's a joke).
