As ive said in my Teamfortress 2 review this game went from amazing banking game to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ wreck. The game was amazing but now DLC and micro transaction rule. I was fine with the addition of skins but giving them stats cmon Almir you said it was free you d*ckwad and you said payday 2 would never have micro transactions. We are disapointed OVERKILL. Just remove the crates or atleast the additional stats :(
Really fun and a good co-op game
Terrible thats it just ♥♥♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mother♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t
Piece of rotting ♥♥♥♥ is all this game is
Half-Life 2 is a bit old but is a very good gameIn fact the best ♥♥♥♥ing game ever
Realy good mod dont join fancy servers first time playing YOU WILL BE KICKED
Very Fun not as fun as it used to be as all f2p games become
Get it just get it 10/10 would eat cake again
Farted on a guys head. He died 10/10 would ♥♥♥♥ again
