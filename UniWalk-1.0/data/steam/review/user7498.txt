I tried. I tried liking this game. I really did. I knew it was CoD or Battlefield, I knew it worked differently. But when that differnece seems to change match to match, I just can't. How someone can, for a distance with a automatic weapon, get me in the head and instanly kill me, yet when I have a shotgun, point blank at an AFKs head, and still not kill them, it's just not fun.And the comunity, my god, the only worse one I've found is Leauge of Legends, and only becuase they were just spiteful of me never having played before rather then helped or even orded me around. In this game... It's just, Alah Ackbar shouted through the mics by people who sound like they aren't old enough legitimently have steam accounts. I've had one game where the people were nice, and the game was fun, and even though I had pretty much the same K/D ratio, I was still a help yo the team and they helpped back.I don't know what the competitive side of this game is like, and I was going to maybe give the mode a go, when I learnt how to play a bit more. But I haven't been able to learn, the experience is so Inconsistent, I just have no idea how anything works.The weapons I get killed by the most, the AWP and AK47, two guns that just don't work like they should, and I can't figure out what other are doing.At the end of every match, you can type things to the other team, but all I've seen is insults and agression.And that's not fun. I can see people who are top notch proffesionals sometimes not having fun while playing bacause it can sometimes be a job to them, but when it seems you need to put job like hours into a game on a casual scale to start enjoying it, it's just... an unsatifing experience.250+ matches, and I've leveled up once. The grind and Climb shouldn't be that steep so soon.Imma give it one more go, maybe in a week or two, I'm burnt out of it for now. One last go to have fun, or it's gonna stop taking up space on my computer.
