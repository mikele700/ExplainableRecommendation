i hate this game so much, i want my money back. i cant believe how boaring and glitchy this game is, i know you SAY you meant to have those glitches but deep down everyone knows you just cant be bothered fixing them i do not recomend getting this, its fun for the first play, but it gets bad and FAST
i am verry dissapointed, i want my money back or something, i know no one will respond, but seriously... i cant believe i bought this. worse still my product key doesn't work on multiplayer, so it never works
fun, scary, and epic, the ultimate combo. its a must for amnesia fans as well, get it
get it
