Looking for a game that takes skill? - I'm sure this is the game for you. Requiring good communication, strong game sense and excellent control of weapon recoil and spray control, Counter-Strike : Global Offensive is a fun yet challenging experience!
Pretty solid sci-fi fps shooter, would definitely recommend it if your looking for a free-to-play shooter game that is very high quality, requires a decent amount of skill and is generally quite fun to play. Features that I enjoyed were the wall hacks or HRV, customizable characters and guns and also big, heavy mechanized hardsuits or 'mechs' which make this game a lot more fun.
