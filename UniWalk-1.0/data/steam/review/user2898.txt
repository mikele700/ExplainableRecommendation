Upon buying this game, i had NO idea about it except for the 'cool' art style, and to be honest.....I WAS BLOWN AWAY.First off, Pros:+Amazing voice overs+Cool soundtrack and sound design+ Cartoony art style+ atmospheric with their storyCons:- Anti-Climatic Ending- FPS Drops (I cant really talk about that [Laptop Skrub] but other people were having little issues)It was originally a 8.5-9 / 10 UNTIL I found these VERY useful in finding what happenedBE WARNED SPOILERS UNLESS YOU HAVE FINISHED THE GAME https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT0mgVL8oWg  and  http://press-start.com.au/2016/02/11/firewatch-explanation-and-analysis/ so basically,  D, or deliliah has been lying to you the whole time about Ned and his son Brian Goodwin and the death of Brian as she knew that Ned was still alive and hiding in the park Overall, after knowing about the metaphors and reasoning on some 'plotholes' i would give this game a:10/10WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?!?!?! BUY THIS F***NG MASTERPIECE
Need more hours..... NEED MORE HOURS!!!! NEED A V8 NOT V6!!!! GEWD DAMN IT CHUMBUCKET!!!! This game is amazing, one of the greatest movie video games i've ever played... and i've played G-Force the video game.It works flawlessly... even with 80+ hours i've had maybe 3 glitches TOPS. When i moved to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop for mobile play with everything low (even shadows) i had 25-30 FPS which was pretty good for the laptops specsHIGHLY RECOMMEND 8/10 For gameplay + story
Just when you think it's about to end..... BAM! 2 More hours of intense action for your face!Then again.... you think everything is finished then BAM! Guess what? ANOTHER 4 Hours!!!In all seriousness, i really enjoyed this game, the aiming was a bit clunky so that made the shotty OP AF the story it wonderul and intense, the scenery OHHHHH the scenery, for a 2013 game even graphics on normal are great but ULTRA?!?! DAMN GAL!Rate: 8/10
