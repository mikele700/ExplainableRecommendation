I like this,but my router keeps making me lose connection 10/10 would play again (p.s. my actual rating is 100000000000000/10)
This is cool
This is a great game. Although I do not have the game,it is great. I would put more into this review,but sadly I do not have the game. =(
I like this game. However, the game sometimes crashes and it says i got kicked from my own game due to no steam login.
Get this game as soon as you can.
Honestly one of the greatest masterpieces of a game. I LOVE the workshop content. I especially love the custom servers.Try to get this game as soon as you can.
Greatest community game and workshop EVER!
