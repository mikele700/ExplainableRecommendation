Grand Theft Auto Had A Hefty Price Tag. But The Result Of Which Is The Best Game I Have Ever Owned By Far With So Much To Do With Hours Of Gameplay I Have Barely Scratched The Surface Of What This Game Has Too Offer. Of Couse Bashing Peoples Heads In With A Baseball Bat And Then Jumping Into A Super Fast Car And Running Over Everyone On A Beach Is Still Alot Of Fun!
Dank AF, Just Dont Bend Over, Go near other players, go near naked players, eat raw meat, -eat raw meat-, fight choppers. unless you have some MLG friends or have spent over 200 hours in game....
Amazing Game Lots Of Fun. Bangs Everywhere, the heists also remind me a bit of GTA V online but without the, open world aspect so to speak. There is nothing more fun when you pull down your mask and spray down a jewelry store! 10/10 recomend to anyone who wants fast paced good graphics and a hell of a lot of fun! Also isnt very demanding according to my friends so I would buy at once! MUST HAVE!
Awesome Game, Great Graphics Only Thing They Need To Make It Less Demanding On Your PC
Good Game.Love The Items.Fun On All AspectsGreat Game!
Great Game, Not like normal sandboxes as this is in space and real time space physics apply. Graphics are quite good for the style of game and its not too blocky like other sandboxes. The destruction textures are stunning and it is awesome when you snap a ship in half and the particals go drifting into space for infinity
BEST GAME EVER!
BEST GAME EVER!
This Review Was Made During Early Access. It May Become A Useless Review As The Game Progresses But This Is How It Is Right Now. currently There Are Only Three Quests Which Are.Get LootGo To Planet And Kill Aliens And Find Dead PeopleAnd Of Course, Flying Across The Universe And Killing People To Find Some Guy A Sandwhich.The Game Is However Alot Of Fun And Shows Alot Of Potential But As Of Yet Needs Alot Of Work Done To Keeping Players Intertained And Having Larger Questlines. The Chat System Works Well With The Ocasional Crash Of The Game Which Is Expected As It Is In Early Access. In The Future Of The Game I Think Having Player Vs Player Open World With Clans/Guilds Could Be A Possibilty. Sadly The Early Access Game Is Very Poorly Optimized With Some Of The Top Computers Getting Around 25 FPS On Lowest Graphics Which Is A Shame. Overall This Game Is Worth Its Price Tag So If You Are Into Open World Space Games With A Touch Of Combat And A Lot Of Exploration This Is The Game For You!
Good Game! Love the gamemodes and flows quite well. Is fun to play with friends and is better than agar,io so if your a fan this is the game for you!
