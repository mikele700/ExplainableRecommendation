So...The devs added a missle launcher that ALWAYS LOCKs ON and never lets go, I'm pretty sure thats not balanced, since I feel like the original MM just got scrapped (Probs was).Also, flak cannons, a good idea, but the fire rate is too high.The original research system, scrappedArmour, scrappedLoot system, whyPremium JUST TO CHANGE YOUR BLOODY AVATARPremium to just make your bot look betterMech legs that have shields that take years to drain offHealers, no longer viableA shotgun, that 1-shots half your botF2P, into P2WDid I mention how OP Lock on Missles are?Overall, with the MM just screwed up, a Newbie isnt going to get far (If they dont pay up)EDIT:Also, Ive been playing this game around when it was published in early 2015 or so, and I just came back a few weeks ago (sadly)I miss the skill required to playI miss the grind to actually get what you wantI miss a MM that worksI miss the old GOOD currencyI will not miss the micro bots that have Ion Distorters on themI will not miss the stupid LOCK ON MISSLE LAUNCHERI will not miss the new currencyI do miss the old game, where you actually had commitment to play.Now I have to quit this game due to..... where do I startGoodbye, New RobocraftR.I.P, Robocraft Community
An amazing game with great variations of planes and tanks, and even with over 300 ping, it feels like I don't have any! War Thunder is an amazing game and I recommend it to everyone
Ive only played this game for only a few days and im hooked right into it! Definatley worth the cash.
This game is pretty much 98% Pay to Win and the only way to get items is to level up, and that happens slowly, although i only play this game because i get bored of my other games, its a good game and the people who don't care about the Pay to Win, then you will enjoy this game
