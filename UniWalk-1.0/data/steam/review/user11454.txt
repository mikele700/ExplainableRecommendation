What I can say ...Just play it, in the end you get confused, but all you can do is lay down, try not to cry then cry a lot.
Like to hear some adventure with the classic op-crossbow mother ♥♥♥♥#er this is your game, so buy it and p-lay and then recommend for someone of course, its a cicle just accept it.
Worst matchmaking, bugs everywhere, no servers available in SA, can't report AFK'S, bad language or abuse, racism, bad teamworking, toxic platyers in general, everything is too ♥♥♥♥ing expensive to buy with credits or real money, Pay to win game, OP mercs everywhere that they won't nerf for reasons. I'm playing for the fun but I won't deny that I wouldnt recommend for anyone, and that I don't ger stressed.
Remember the time when assassin's creed was about stealth
Definetely not worth it
