Spent over 600 h of my life on this, still only just above average in terms of rank. 10/10 would waste life again.
Great game, becomes extremely satisfying as the levels progress.For $3, its a no brainer!
This game is absolutely wonderful. Great fun and super hilarious!10/10 would recomnd.
This game is a MUST play. If you don't already own the game, buy it. the gameplay mechanics are very interesting and enjoyable. Plus the storyline is possibly my ALL TIME favorite. I played this in one sitting I enjoyed it so much.
