This game has become a micro-transaction white fluid dumpster and has lost all its pride. It has given up trying.. Don't buy this game... Let it die.. It has lived too long and it is begging for death.. Yearning for it.. Alas , It has become a shell of its former self and is souless in direction.
If you can withstand the deaths of a pink haired spoiled rich kid , this game is for you! So many endings in so little time! (Not really, More endings = More time). Death? Betrayal? Underage marriage? War? Poisonous chocolates? WE GOT IT!But seriously though , this game is very dark for its bright cheerful anime vibe. It will make you really think whether you should practice in dancing or foriegn affairs. Every decision you make could cost you your life.Had fun , buy it when it is on sale but not when it is full priced.
I used to dislike this game in Early Alpha but seeing it almost complete and having a revamped design and structure to it makes me enjoy it more. The environments don't feel as tight as they did in the Alpha giving the level design a more open feel.The game isn't as pay to win as it was before and even if you fork over your dough you'll still have to work very hard to make the items you got for that mula be strong enough to tackle missions.There's more stuff I could talk about but Im too lazy to think of more stuff.I'd rate it 7.5/10
Dat soundtrack dough... 11/10 .. would bang again!(Get it cause the gun thingy... ha.. please kill me)
Thought this game was online co-op. It wasn't. Also I am in the progress of refunding this game and lm gonna get 50% of what I payed for. What.Goodbye $13.50 buckaroonies.
