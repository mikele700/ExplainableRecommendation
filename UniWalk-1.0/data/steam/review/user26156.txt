This game is heaps of fun, but i cannot recommend it due to the fact that there is no grouping system for playing with your friends, the only way is to constantly join and leave lobbys until you find your friend. which means that games take forever to start from people leaving all the time.i would highly recommend this game if they can fix this with a grouping system.
