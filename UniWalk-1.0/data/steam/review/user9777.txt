this is a great game! I've played it nonstop, the maps are great, the skins are awesome but the ranking system is ok. otherwise, very great!
10/10 would kill zombies again
Great Survival Game! A bit like minecraft hunger games but with different enemies and items and controls.
Best Game so far, this game is about survival, building bases, pvp, and more! but the wolves make me a bit jumpscared xD
This game is like CSGO but u do minigames and unlock different weapons, its a bit like Dirty Bomb, except its more like a first person shooter, but roughly more great to enjoy! if you are playing Dirty Bomb, you should go and get this game!
This Game is actually pretty decent, but fun to play, but now you cant play multiplayer anymore, because the servers had been shut down. But it is a still good playable game. I recommend you buy it since it has cool minigames.
One of my second favourite steam games! it The Addons that they have in the steam workshop are really great, even the maps, player models, etc. been playing this game since 2014 when i got my steam account, and bought this game which was my first ever game on PC!
