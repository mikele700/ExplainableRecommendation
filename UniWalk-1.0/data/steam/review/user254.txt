My girlfriend at the time was a lol player and was petrified to hear that i had been given a beta key a few years back but she said that i would get over it.  So she locked herself in the room with me while i played, not eating or drinking... and the corpse is starting to smell now, if someone could come and remove her... yeah that'd be great
Not balanced at all and has serious frame issues on all graphics settings would recommend to people i don't like to get them away from me for 20 minutes
