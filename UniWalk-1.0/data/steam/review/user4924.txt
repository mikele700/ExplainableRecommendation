Meh allright i gusse u need to do something at the end when finished i finished in 3 days and got bored when finished u should be able to do like vsers online and ♥♥♥♥ -.- not campain i dont recomend unless u play over and over again
Amazing game, loving it. First time i have experienced and you dont need to pay to win! But grinding gold takes a long time. First 30K is easy to get but after that it takes quite a while. The support EXP mission, way to hard to complete, my opinion, make it easier or make the reward greater so it is worth while. Other then that, great game!
Don't buy, ♥♥♥♥ game, trash, rank 3, pssshh, rank 2 still after a week. takes forever to rank up. used to be good without the ranking system back in the dayz. worst game, remove or make system easier to level, trash game. spit on you, spit spit
Hm, what to say? It has real potential... I have had this game for a while now, didnt play much but, after a few months it advanced a lot. To a multiplayer with 10 people playing to a massive Co-OP, just started Single Player Campaign, and a much bigger multiplayer with active servers and ranks going up to 100. Excellent for a early access... worth the money (imo). Love the CO-OP with the robots, quiet difficult but makes it fun.There is a lot to come...
