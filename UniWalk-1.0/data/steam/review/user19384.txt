Aweful gameplay; players take 2 seconds to respond to your actions when it-'s already too late, and you can easily get fakked 10-0 although you-'re playing much better than the opponent or your opponent is noob. He just keeps running in a straight line from the midfield to your defence and presses a key called -Square- key to shoot the ball, oh oups, to score a goal*.Oh I should also mention that the only pros about this game are Konami ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers, it-'s really funny when you-'re playing a game and suddenly a box appears saying -'connection lost between you and the opponent (void)-', this happens at 60% of the times and really gets me so high that I really start to enjoy it, and uh, w.t.f? Why does the transition between menus take 5 gentle seconds? I guess that when this game coders do their job, they are drunk or something, or guess what, it-'s a free game so let-'s ♥♥♥♥ off steam users and enjoy those unique moments, fakk you konamiNow i-'ll happily go spend 23$ on fifa 16, it would always be cheaper than spending my time on pes myclub
Recommended, I can't find any cons
One of my favourite games however my PC sturrgles to run it
Not optimized at all, fps and performance suck
Fun game
Active and hard working devs is what encouraged me to post my positive review on the game.
I've bought the game and discovered it yesterday... BEST GAME EVER (EVEN BETTER THAN DAYZ)
One the best fps games i've ever played, as epic as cs 1.6
