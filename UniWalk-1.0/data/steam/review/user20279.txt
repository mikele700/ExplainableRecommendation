I've been playing Terraria for 3 years now and its been my top favourite ever since i bought it, so i do suggest to buy it some people might not like 2D platformers but you should try this, you won't regret it.
when i go to make an accont its all ways say's You do not meet the requirements to register for an account so i get peed off and shut down my pc or play a game
