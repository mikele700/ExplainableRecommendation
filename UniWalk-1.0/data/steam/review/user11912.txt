Bright pink motorcycle, missile launchers, collecting women. nuff said.
By far my favourite first person shooter of all time.A pretty decent story, with solid and very fun gameplay mechanics and probably the most surprising ending to a video game I have seen in a long time.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good first person shooter.Definatly going to play this game again on -True West- difficulty.
