I really like this game. I'm a  big fan of the UT series, & it may show my naivete to the genre here (I'm not sure if I'm really a 'serious' gamer, just someone who loves gaming & has been doing it since like '93-'94), but this game feels like some sweet expansion of UT3. That's not a bad thing at all. I can't wait for the game to get some more levels etc., but it's definitely on its way & I can tell the devs really care about the community (which I really hope blossoms, because the mods etc. will be wild).If you like games like UT3, at least grab it while it's on special - I think it deserves that hand up!
Really great software. Totally recommend it for anyone trying to set up a budget.
So, this is easily my most-played, go-to multiplayer game whenever I've had friends over for the past year or so... basically since I started playing it. Whether I'm working with or against my buddies, you're guaranteed some good times with this one.
If anyone looks through my reviews, a theme that probably runs through them is that I'm typically wary of 'indie' games. I couldn't ignore the press on this one, though, & from the intro music on, I knew ♥♥♥♥ was really really real. Amazingly addictive, frustrating & plain fun. Have a drink while you play, but one too many & you'll never beat it.
