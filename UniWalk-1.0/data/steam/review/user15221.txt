Great Game!+Great Story +Open world+Awesome Customisable Vehicles+Multiplayer+Co-opThe Downside:- Barely any guns
Don't be fooled by the Free 2 Play Tag that this game wears. This stupid ♥♥♥ game is lying. You play at first and have fun. Then some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with an Anger starts shooting you and teasing the fact that you were a gibus and don't have any cosemetics. You don't understand but start to learn about trading and hats. The Sniper with the Anger then keeps taunting you and you become fed up. You put money in your wallet and trade for a Genuine Anger. You put it on and start killing the experianced Sniper due to the long hours of TF2 you have forged through blood and sweat and finally manage to dominate him. You tease him with your Genuine Anger, expecting him to react. But He doesn't. He just stands there and laughs. For he is Satan himself. He laughs at your for spending money on pixels and vanishes. You hold your Genuine Anger (no pun intended ) and Austrailium Sniper Rifle. Realising you have become the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Pay 2 play sniper that bullied you. You are angry. You need to take it out on someone. A little sniper with a gibus walks out of the enemy's spawn, you smile.Short version: Basically, some stupid ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ sniper kills you a lot. So you end up buying hats to ♥♥♥♥ him off. But he is satan so it doesn't work and you lose.EDIT: Why is the word P-I-S-S a censored word, like one of the main characters basically chucks a jar of it at people to hurt them. wtf.
I got framed for burning down a forest after a walked into a dead one, then I got kicked.Yes/10
Decent top down shooter that is really fun but can get a bit boring if you play too much (I guess that goes for all games though). Would work well with a warhammer 40k mod (The soldiers remind me of imperial guardsmen).
