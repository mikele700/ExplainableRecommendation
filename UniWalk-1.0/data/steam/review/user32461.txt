From the very first videos that promoted this game prior to its launch on Steam, the game looked impressive, melding a voxel game (similar in nature to another popular game) to a deformable physics platform set in Space.From it official launch in 2013, Space Engineers has been in Early Access.By no means has it been a smooth ride, but each week the developers have been adding to and improving the game, adding features requested by the community, as well as adding their own particular enhancements.The game has grown substantially in that time, making Space Engineers an impressive multiplayer sandbox experience.The developers have hinted at many new things on the horizon which will no doubt improve the game play immensely and expand the playability when they are released in the coming months.I've personally spent more hours playing this game than any other in my Steam catalogue, and hope to continue playing for a long time to come.- If you like building stuff....- If you like smashing stuff...- If you like flying space ships...- If you like exploring massively open space...- If you like encountering random procedurally generated items...- If you like building/flying model replicas of famous SciFi ships...- If you like competing with players to build the biggest meanest ship to pit against one another...- If you like experimenting with physics...- If you like the community experience of sharing things you have made...- If you like a game with a large community following...- If you like a game where players can actively contribute modifications to expand the game...- If you seeing a developer actively spending time to improve their game...Then please consider having a look at Space Engineers.
