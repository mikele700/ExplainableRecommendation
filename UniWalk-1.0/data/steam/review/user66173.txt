No Battlefield?Play this game!!
Great start, Great story, Great pace, Great weapons, Great supports, and what's more? GREAT GAMEPLAY.
For those who loves Open World Games, this game is a perfect choice. Travelling around, Killing people,  you can do anything.......not everything tho. So yeah.
JUST. READ. IT.It's brillaint.
Very touching story, great music and even good character designs.
Good in everything. ( not everything ) Just......go get a controller, way better controlling movement.
Why do I need to review?JUST CAUSE...........2
For those who love open world games like me, would understand.Even how hard the game bugs done to me,Even how hard the game is very much difficult that strikes me,Even how hard to get great items and various armors that make me rage so hard,Even with the stupid AI character that stupidly glitch around.No matter what get in my way, the whole game makes me forget about everything that sucks.
