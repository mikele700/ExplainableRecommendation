LOVE THE GAME.. had high hopes from the beginning and they are still high for almost beating the game completley, This game really reminds me of the Dead Island series which it should its just a nice feel to have an optimized working game.. my system is over qualified to run this game but I have played AC unity and my 2 980's were working there ♥♥♥ off to stay at 22 FPS on low settings. I recomend this game to everyone it is a really nice game and have super high hopes for the DLC in the future
