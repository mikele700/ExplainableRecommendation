This game is my favourite top down shooter of all time. It has a nice progression system so you get a sense of achievment upon leveling along with some intense battles against the alien horde. I think the only con is the lack of levels, there isn't much but you can download tonnes of community levels on websites with mods making the gameplay go on forever. Plus there is an easy to use dev kit so you can make levels and play them with your mates because its all FREE!!! 10/10 would reccomend this for the first steam game you get
