personally, this game is just to over priced but other than that really good (still quite a few bugs though)
I think that THE WITCHER 2: ASSASSINS OF KINGS is one of the best games out, I personally do not play it because it is to laggy but that just means that the game has AWESOME GRAPHICS. even though you need a good pc to do high, i think it is totally worth it.
this game is really good. the graphics are average, but i don't mind that, also it is really fun playing with friends and you will have a good laugh- trust me. If you just want to kick back and relax with your mates this is the game for you (and it's free!!!)
this a a great, casual attempt at a serious game that is done perfectly well. would have to recomend
