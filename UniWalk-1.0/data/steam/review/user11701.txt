Even without first picking up the first game p0rtal it's extremely easy to get into and love portal two the puzzles are amazing and offer different ways of thinking and moving about the game. The characters speak to you as if they know what your thinking and the dialogue and graphic design are beautiful. Definitely would recommend it to anyone.
