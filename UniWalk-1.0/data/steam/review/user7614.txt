Please Note: I only have 7+ hours on this account but on my other account i have 75+The Forest is a Horror survival, You start off in a plane, The plane crashers and You are the only survivor Or Are you?You will have to make shelter, fire so on,But be carful...The -cannibals- Will try to get you and you have to defend your selfI would reccoment this game 100% Worth The Money
I recommend this game, it is such a fun game to play, it is like minecraft and Day-Z in one.
