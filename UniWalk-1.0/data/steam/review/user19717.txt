This is my favourite game in the whole world :)XOXOX
Pros: Nice story and atmosphereCharacters are fleshed out well i believe for the first episodeThe shaders are beautifulCons:Graphics are noticbly pixelated lip sync is very out of wack Overall i enjoyed the first episode i cant wait to see what the next one brings to the table 
Fluent gameplay controls and fun airbattles even mini campaigns and as the game progresses land battles and naval battles whats not to love 9/10
Following up on the previous review I realize I was over-hyping the game and not looking fully at the game. While the game was very detailed and improved on graphics and game play it lacked in some of the things the made some of the older Bethesda games great like character development, interesting NPC's that felt believable and could relate to, parts of the story line were predictable and not very exciting. To sum it up it is a very decent game and very fun to play but it can get a bit repetitive at times i would give it a strong 8/10
This is by far one of the most addicive sanbox games I have ever player with an execellent combat system that feels realistic with every hit and block and is very satisfying to conquer citys and towns which adds to your faction you are working with or your very own faction that you have made. the only downside to the game is that it is slow to start out your sort of wondering what to do and this can be frustrating but overall it is a very good game and i give it a 9/10
good game with action and strategy combined with realism.
