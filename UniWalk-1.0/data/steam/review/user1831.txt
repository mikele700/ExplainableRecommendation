Best game to kill an afternoon, and possibly the following day as well.Overall, Excellent Game. 10/10
You either die a noob; repetitively. Or live long enough to be called a hacker; repetitively.Great game but one of the worst communities on steam.If you can put up with unwarranted hate, this game is definitely for you. Other then that, excellent game.9.5/10
One of the best F2P first-person shooters out there. A harmonic combination of humour, strategy and excitement come together to form a must have game. Although Team Fortress 2 is nearly 5 years old, the FPS action never has a dull moment. I recommend that anyone interested in TF2  should download the game without hesitation.
