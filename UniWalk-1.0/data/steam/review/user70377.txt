this game is amazing if your into dayz or a open world zombie games. It shows really good graphics with its Water,Sky and all the structures and is fun to play with friends.
People will say they only bought the game for the puzzles but you know its lies. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I could use a full whole hour on this review on why I recommend this game but ill keep it short. Elite Dangerous is basically a outer space flying sim with jobs that start from delivering cargo to space station in other solar system to using combat to destroy a wanted ship.But thats not were ill stop the best part of this game that caught my attention is that this game features online mode and a solo mode.The only problem I had with this game was that if you wanted to play solo you have to be atleast connected to the internet apart from that though this game is a amazing game to play.
The money I spent on this game was well worth it even though its in early access and has a small amount of things to do you can always use the experemental build test out things that are almost added everyday so would I recommend this game HELL YEAH I WOULD!
Even though I tried this on a macbook pro (obviously not a gaming computer) this game seems to be one of those games where you need a strong pc to play im not saying this game is bad but its just not good for anyone with computers that are not good for handling high graphical games but if you find a computer that can handle games like this then knock your selfs out.
Amazing game to buy worth every cent.
