this is an awsome sandbox game Play solo, join a server, or get creative and make you own inventions
play as Rochelle, Ellis, Coach, Nick and play the maps dead center, cold water, the sacrifice, and more
 An extensive game with hours of gameplay, mind bending puzzles, and portal logic. It also includes great humor along with multiplayer. Play as Atlas or P-body, using communication and teamwork skills at the finest. I highly recomend this to all gamers who like logical games.
Graphics, gameplay, EVERYTHING is lined up. I recommend this for all COD fans!
Like a combination of HL2 And l4d
 Battleblock Theater was and is a REALLY great time. I just love all the stages, the creative characters and weapons, and the dark based humor, I just LOVE how this was put together. There was mind buzzing puzzles that would keep you on the end of your seat until you either rage quit or continued. I also adore the feature of ALL the customizations for your character and the useful weapons that are great for both combat and the levels itself (the goo bubble being me favorite.) I would defineately recommend this game for all gamers that love platform, logic, and humorous gameplay.
Honestly, I was am amazed by The Blinding Of Issac now a DLC add-on? EPIC!
