a Shame it feels like its a dead Game When i first got on there was just npcs to talk to for quests like any mmo out there but its a low spec mmo so i was'nt expecting FULL HD Grahcis or anything but they add a nice touch
Oh Man This Game Damn is it Fun You can Fish and Hack and slash monsters and the music is Good simliar to fables music and its a pretty Fast Paced game you get Epic ♥♥♥ armor in it aswell
