This game is great! Even with the remaster/reboot/sequel? (I haven't played rebirth as of this recommendation) I still find myself coming back to this game time and time again due to its replayability with its randomly generated levels/rooms that make every game different and are similar to the first Legend of Zelda's dugeons, where you have to beat every enemy in the room to continue forward. You also collect items on the way either found in rooms with a gold crown on the door, the store, random encounters with certain enemies, secret rooms and even more...also all the items are either  similar or different to each other so it can be quite easy to get an awesome combo to beat your enemies...or a bad combo :beatmeat: you can also get usable items like cards, bombs or books that can either shield you, increase your attack or even make you invincible. Overall, I love this game,I love its soundtrack, I love its art style, I love its simply story and I love its gamplay :)
