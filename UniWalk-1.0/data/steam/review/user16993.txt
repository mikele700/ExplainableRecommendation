 PRO'S - Near same mechanics as csgo with bhops- Great game to play with friends - Only puts you down 2c ( When on sale )- When your fists are stronger than the gun you spawn with- The unrealistic ragdoll when you punch the zombies face in. Which is pretty fun- You can punch zombies from your car even when you're driving- You can use anything as a weapon CON'S - Guns are still broken to the ♥♥♥♥ house, its a minigun-shotgun-singleshot-bolt action-rifle or a mag-7 from csgo- The black zombies spawning on your head ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the crap out of you- How fast the black zombies run- You cant sneak into town to get supplys because most zombies spawn on you- The car sounds dont fade in or out then just snap in- You look at the zombies and they die for no reason- The spelling is terrible( I personally recommend this game )
