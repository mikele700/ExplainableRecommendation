Such a great game to play of a night/day with friends, The game can be frustrating and it is difficult to stay stealthy but once you get the hang of the game you won't be able to stop playing and will most likely end up purchasing all the DLC's for about 15 bucks. Highly reccommended game!
Great Game but please fix Multiplayer!!!! always getting kicked out because of sync it's annoying!!!
Great Game, (If you like to get the absolute ♥♥♥♥ scared out of you), terrifying game with great graphics, some scenes are a little predictable but all in all it's one of the scariest games I've played yet.Would love to see a sequal!
Scary, Not as good as the first though
