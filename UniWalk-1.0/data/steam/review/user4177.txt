To be completely honest, It's a good game, but it didn't live up to my expectations. I might have had too high expectations for it seeing as I played LEGO Batman before this, but for me something just didn't feel right. I'd recommend that you try it if you have the money to spare and if it's on sale, but personally it's not worth the full price.
