Pure win! Much easier than the first game, but still a blast to play through.
Solid game for the price of nothing. Match making can be quite slow due to a lack of local players. But once in a game there is much fun to be had. Would recommend everyone to at least download and give this game a shot.
Quite possibly the best mutliplayer FPS ever. Plus it has HATS!!!
