The most impressive stuff to me is the good graphic and low required disk space when installing ( < 300Mb). The game is fun and really easy to play :) It's totally non-pay-to-win game ( Real money is just used for decoration your profile in game).The graphic is a bit annoying to my eyes when I'm playing more than 20 mins, though. Besides, The gun's recoil is very low (You can take AK-47 then spray with pretty accuration)7/10
