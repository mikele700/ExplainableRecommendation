This is a good game it has potential to be pretty good they have alright cars pretty good but i would like some of my favorite cars in it but other than that and a tiny bit dodgy it is a well made game they need a steam workshop then it will be great
One of my favorite games i played when i was a kid rockstar always makes the best games
Good game-Good for action-Good for lan partys and playing with friends-Good for solo game playJust straight up a good game
