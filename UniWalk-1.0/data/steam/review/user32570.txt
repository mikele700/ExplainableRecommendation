Fun game difficulty is hard and weapons only spawn on a specific level so if you dont scour the entire level then you are going to be running and using weapons inneficiently this is a amazing roguelike game if you want a challenge play it. you will die and die and die and die *you've been warned*
Look ive played this once before sensitivity was crazy but im gonna give it another go at that time i gave it 4 / 10 but now just from reviews im gonna come back with a vengeance and give it a 8/10 depending on experience this time
