highly underrated indie title. great gameplay and visuals.
best shooter ever.a must try.
If you express any love for building your own custom death machine to raze and murder for no discernable reason other than for the glory of satan, then this is the game for you.the array of different tools and crafts you could use to build is by itself worth the price you pay. Although the game is still in its alpha stages, the fact that that the price is this low for now, its a steal to have and i heavily recommend it.
this game is an amazing and rare breed and must be tried by card and board game lovers everywhere.everything from the fact that you can choose which encounter you want to the condescending and sarcastic remarks by the dealer makes it feel authentic.the game does not let up on the different and difficult cards and choices you'll have to make. Do u want to feed a hungry man even though you only have a bit of food left? Do you feel like returning the sword and shield of a dead man for his funeral or would rather keep it? all these is what keeps you invested in this game in the long run.although the combat section is boring and pretty simple, they're short and dont take up much of your time.Again, this game is a must buy for lovers of board and card games and i heavily recommend it.
