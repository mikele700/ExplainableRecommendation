In this game you play as a man that is stuck in an endless loop of flight and death. Everytime he dies, he must fly again, only to blast into the ground at 180 kmph. He does some tricks on the way down, barrel rolls, backflips, enough to get the adrenaline flowing. I can only hope that the rush is enough to dull the pain.All jokes aside however, this is definately the best proximity wingsuit flying game to date. Well optimized, handles great with a controller. I am truly exited to see how this game turns out.
Better than Outside.
