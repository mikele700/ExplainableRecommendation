Been playing since the 1.4 patch of DayZ, so you'll know this is coming from a DayZ fan at heart. When Rocket promised and informed us about standalone we all cheered! What's more he said it'll be done by 2012 Christmast! We were kind of sad when Chrismast time passed and the standalone was no where to be seen.Several months later both good and bad things surfaced. WarZ being released and ofc the final development cycle of Standalone. Everyone thought it would come out 2014 and out of no where. The game appeared on Steam's Early Acess.I instantly bought it and theres something I have to say. It's really ALPHA. So early into alpha that the game is poorly opitimized, no anti-hacks have been implemented and glitches galore. That being said there are some redeeming factors.It's absolute fun. Fun to the point where. I don't care anymore if I died from a glitch. Ironically because this game's loot is so unbalanced that you can gear yourself up in 10 minutes. Looting is soo much fun. Being a veteran in DayZ usually mean surviving for weeks and always go for high-value loot buildings. Even though it's the same mapandsame premise I'm actually looting houses for food.It was worth my money. Thats all that matters
waste of money......Nothing else
