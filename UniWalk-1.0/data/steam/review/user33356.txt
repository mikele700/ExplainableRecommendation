A very fun multiplayer game which can keep you occupied for hours. (6 players)Although graphics aren-'t amazing, gameplay is rather enjoyable, especially after hearing that satisfying headshot go -CRACK-!Recommend this game for those who love killing zombies and especially like gore. c;
I've just started this game and already enjoying myself so much!A great game to play with friends (or enemies >:D ), surviving and building up your camp. I assume multiplayer is a lot more intense than a local server, but thats up to you guys to decide. Free to play, but tbh should be at least $2. Not complaining that it's free though. Show your support to the creator by purchasing the permanent gold pack ($4.99), but worth every cent. Many swag everywhere with a lot more customisable character stuff!Well even if you aren't sure about whether to get the game or not, it's free, so JUST DO IT! ;D
