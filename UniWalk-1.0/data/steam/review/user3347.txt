I gave this game a chance, and I enjoyed my first few hours. But when I noticed I was being shot behind corners with 50 ms ping, I knew something was wrong. The hit registration is sometimes terrible, and the simple fact I can get run and gunned when I was watching a corner for the past 10 seconds? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Don't even bother with this game.
Wow.Never been a big fan of text based games, but this is really good. It has taughts me a few things. 1. We all need an Emily 2. I'm really ♥♥♥♥ at talking to girls 3. When goodbye is the only option :'( Definetly worth your time.
-I-'m looking for a young girl.--Aren-'t we all, pal?-In all seriousness though, this game is a masterpiece.
awsome game thats all
