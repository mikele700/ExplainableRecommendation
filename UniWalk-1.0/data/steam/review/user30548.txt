A thrilling multiplayer that actually creates a new sense of gameplay. It gives a somewhat new direction of mulitplayer experience while also feeling familar enough that you don't feel like you are playing Catan for the first time.Simple controls, nice little (could be bigger) weapons list, and as fiar as I have played expansive map collection. However I do feel like that is where the game could be a little lacking. And, there only seems to be a few downsides. Simply put; the selection of maps- that are quite literally the same, no singleplayer/training mode (or even first-timer newb mode bot game), and that NO ONE IS ON ANY SERVERS!Great game to put your rep on the line and battle it out with friends!
