I really like playing this, but it desperately needs some updates.
I love to community content for this game, as far as city building games go, I think this is the best current game available, Sim City 5 was a huge flop and was nowhere near as fun to drive as this.
I used to play the original when I wasyounger, it's still hilariously simple and fun.
Absolutely love this game! Would love to see worshop maps be implimented at some point ;D
By far the worst Game with the Flatout Title.
I was expecting to hate this game, boy was I so very wrong! This game absolutely destroyed my expectations and was worth the money I paid for it.
The amount of game modes available makes this worth buying.
I have played CounterStrike since 2001 and I love the fact that the game hasn't changed too much from the originals. I have played CS:GO for a fair while now (1600+ hours) and I don't see myself stopping any time soon.
