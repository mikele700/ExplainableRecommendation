really fun, can play for hours.
Great game, good fun. Only down side to the game is how long it takes to tame some dinosaurs. It's pretty bad when your taming a good dino but you have to log off so you fill it up with berries / meat and by the time you log in again its woken up and you've wasted so much resources on it.
Terrible game, they take a server down without telling anyone for the whole day making it so you cannot access your characters. Then when the server finally comes back on i go to log in, the launcher loads and then asks me to log in (it usually auto logs me in through steam but this time it didnt), so i enter my details in and get an error saying i cannot log in. so i google what the problem was and it told me that i have apparently broken some rule or am in a country that the game is banned in (which neither of them are true). So i try to play the game again later, after leaving it for a while, i log in, it works, it goes to character select, i choose my character and click -enter world-. It goes to the loading screen and when it reaches 100% the screen goes black, the window closes and it gives me some stupid reason, trying to explain why the game crashed..... so i kept trying to open the game and it kept doing the same crash. 10/10 waste of time to get the game DO NOT get this worthless crap.
Real fun game, just a shame that it had idiots for developers. Decide to shut down the game as their way of improving it, cause u kno, their real smart. People claim that the game is dead or is going dead, yet all the times i qued up for a match i got one in seconds. 10/10 for killing a game that could make you money and bring joy to so many people, was fun while it lasted sucks that its ending.
