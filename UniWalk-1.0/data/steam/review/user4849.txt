I find this game to be quite slow, I enjoy it for a once a day session for about 30 minutes, There doesn't seem to be any pay walls but people who pay for in game items have a much easier time, I like to think of it as buying easy mode. It has a style of mmo I prefer whereby I don't have to be a Hero killing 15 boars and leveling up I can go and grow a garden or make a pretty dress so I can make an even prettier dress. All in all I would say play if you're patient or pay if youâ€™re not. Not for everyone.
