THIS GAME IS DYNAMITE! The game was created using Half Life's engine, and it is entirely fantastic :)Its a western cowboy type shooter, but it feels a little more polished than most fps out today *cough cough* call of dooty *cough*I really recommend getting it.Lazakin out~
gets 20-30 frames tops, still has played 150+ hours.Good Game, wish I had better gear, in game and irl.20/30 Frames Under Construction, Kay? (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)
I don't usually write negative reviews, (if any reviews for that matter) and I must say, if you have recieved a coupon for this game and bought it, then refund it. Not worth $1.00, espicially not worth $10 for something a highschool teacher made since he had nothing better to do. Once launching in, firstly only 3 other players were online and did not act very nicely towards me. Secondly, even though it does say it's an early access game, its still in pre-alpha. Not even alpha, *PRE*TLDR; Spent $1.00 on a highschool project that is meant to be in 48 hour game jam for ~FREE~
Better than the worst of fish: CoDnuff saidJoking aside, suprisingly good fps, as many of the genre of the past few years have been less than satisfactory to play.The competitive, and many other game modes offer quite a lot of gameplay time. If your looking for a game to show off your skill and power this is the place.

Absolutely stunning graphics and the gameplay may be a tad repetitive but there is different elements which make it fun to play for hours on end. Highly recommend playing this game.
