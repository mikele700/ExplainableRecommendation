I picked up this game for a solid key, and i must say it was worth it entirely! This game is extremly fun to play, and knocking players from your favourite games (such as clap trap and Sam) of the table is very enjoyable! However, there is a minor set back that may swing if you want to buy this game or not, and that is the in game items that you can obtain from this game (for tf2 and borderlans). In Poker Night 1, it was random and the players would put their items up, however, now you have to complete a set of challenges, then knock every player of the table in order to win the item. I find this fun and challenging, but i can see why people wouldn't like this change.(Would reccomend picking Poker Night 1 up as well!)
