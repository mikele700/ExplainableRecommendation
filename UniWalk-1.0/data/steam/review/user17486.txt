This is the best game ever!
Such a good gameThis game has an stroyline with amazing scenery. This game has those intense battle scenes and it has amazing well structured enimies. This game makes Alice more -badass- and i love that. Although this has a small bug during the exicutoiner battle where the ruin is glitched out, but its still a good game. I recommend this game, its awesome and i can-'t wait for the next one (if there is one, i heard rumours) :)
