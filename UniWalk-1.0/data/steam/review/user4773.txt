Absolutely love Pinball FX2 as you can see by the hours.  I am in the best steam group -The Pinball Family- for which we have tournaments all year round.  Great work Zen, I applaud your work.  I would really love to see a CRICKET  themed table....please please with cherries on top.  Alot of people love cricket around the world, oh and Ice Hockey would be pretty cool too.
