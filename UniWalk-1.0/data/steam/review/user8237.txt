Pretty great software with a great price. Less complicated from other known texture map generators out there but still manages to create high quality maps. Any modellers, pros or noobs alike are recommended to use this.
This game somehow makes me less interested to pre-order GTA V. I mean C'MON, you can't mass murdering ugly, noob alien ♥♥♥♥♥es with Matrix-like power along with alien guns while wearing colourful, gay-looking attire (a female attire I think) and listening to Aerosmith's I Dont Wanna Miss A Thing in the same time in GTA V. Right?10/10 would pile drive old lady again
