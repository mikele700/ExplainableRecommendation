This is not the game which you play for its stunning graphics or ground breaking gameplay dynamics.Its not the game for a compelling and book quality storyline of the single player mode.It is however a great example of how an RTS can be done well if not simply. The online battles have some intense competition but also have the size to allow new players to grow. This is one of the games of the childhood and though -HD- edition doesn-'t offer much different from the one I played on the old Windows 98 the servers work and I still get quality hours out of it.Do recommend, value for money game
