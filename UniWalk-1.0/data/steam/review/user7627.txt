Awesome!
Very buggy game with terrible graphics.The only good thing is the sound effects which are very nice.
Slighly boring gameplay, Par graphics and a poorly optimised game for the PC makes this a tough review. I do enjoy simulators, but you have to be a train fan to really enjoy this game.
Great game
Fun game but can be tedious at times.
One of the best sims around. Defenatly have a look at this game!
