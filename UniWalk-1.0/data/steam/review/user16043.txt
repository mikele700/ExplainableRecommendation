I read a few of the reviews and honestly it seems like people just want to hate on it. This game is a brilliantly built game, leveling is honestly fun, plus the 3 dungeon re-do allows you to hone your skills and rank up each time. Early level players get given some great gear and late level players are able to earn fantastic gear just by doing dungeons. PvP may be more geared toward -pay to play- but honestly you can dominate with enough skill. Play safe and smart.
