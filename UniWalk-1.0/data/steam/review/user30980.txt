I'm having way more fun than I should.10/10 Vertiginous Golf is the best game on steam
It--'s fun to try and get every achievement, except for dodging 200 lightning bolts. My laptop lags a bit from the fog and makes it almost impossible to get any higher than 30, but other than that I--'m very much enjoying the port.Oh, and I haven--'t tried FFX-2 yet, but I assume it--'s as okay as it always was.
Plants vs. Zombies is the only game in which zombies try to fool you into thinking that they are your mother.10/10 would break vases again.
