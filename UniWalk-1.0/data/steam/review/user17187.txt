Great Game. A step up from Magicite in terms of gameplay and complexity while still keeping simple. Great game for the price with endless replay ability. 9/10 Galactic Cadets
This game is a fun game. However with all the updates and additions to the game it has become confusing. You have to dedicate a few hours to learn the game. I rte this game 3 1/2 out of 5 plasma cannons.
DOTA 2 (Defence Of The Ancients) is the best free-to-play game on Steam. It is a Magic/Strategy game that will keep you playing for hours. It is really good fun and is great if you are into Magic/Midevial. I rate this game:4½ /5  Elder Titans
Such a well designed game. It is so creative and 'out there' but it works. I really enjoyed this game and would love to see DLC and/or sequels for the game. I really enjoyed the game. 10/10
Such a nice and beautifu game! 4½ /5
