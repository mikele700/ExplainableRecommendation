Here is my reveiw of this game Now i have about 17 or so hours on this game i look forward to more but my only issues are the lagged zombie hits and some silly deaths with walls but thats all Many pros The weapon spawns have been changed to make them more common the spawns are alright but the map needs to be smaller like what they did with DayZ the map still feels huge but its not as big Cause i played 2 hours DayZ mod i would just make it to Stary Sobor But now with the stand alone i can go to Stary Sobor Balota And the NWAF in about 2/3 hoursMore things i think need to be done is just minor bugs i would reccomend buying this game if your into RTS and FPS with P2W physicals but ammo needs to be findable other than that i rate the game a 8/10 for it has to get better no matter what i  would pay to play this game its quite a fun game to play and its very well worth the money of $5
