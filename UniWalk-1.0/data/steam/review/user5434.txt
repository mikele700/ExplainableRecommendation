This $5 DLC to Unturned, offers a lot more than what you expect.Probably even offers more than your average EA DLC.
ALthough it only has 4 maps, this game has a lot of potential. Remember it is still in Alpha, and future updates are coming soon. This game runs the source engine, which also run Gmod and Half-Life 2, and also originally a Half Life 2 mod, like Gmod. I see great things for this game. Although it has its flaws it is still good.I suggest leveling up, adding more maps, and ability to change your guns and customize equipment.9.5/10
