This is game has alot to offer in Early Access and its very impressive how much updates are coming out and how much work the team is putting into the game, so if i was you I would get this game.
This game is so good i want to play Dino D Day all the time but i just can't wait for the BIG UPDATE WITH ALOT OF NEW DINOSAURS!
This game runs really smoothly when you have the setting low or medium but you will need and better computer to run with high settings but I have a really Poopy computer and it runs this game Fine and I really do like the new things that are being added so If you like Dinosaur games like i do then get this not the old Primal Carnage the NEW One get it NOW!!!
