Honestly, As somebody who thought that cod has been the same thing over and over well before black ops 2, I laughed at another COD however i played this game at my friends house and I instantly became hooked. Yea there may be fps problems but Bo3 is a breathe for fresh air for the cod genre. The weapons are pretty balenced and the perks too. This is a game that i find you can play for hours on end, and not have that typical bad cod taste. I strongly reccomend this game. For all New COD and Seasoned players. Rate 8.5/10
Choice, It's Fun. However it can be slightly anoying at times, other than that its extremly fun.
This Game is really fun, however the unlock of weapons holds it back, but if you can look past that this game is a definite buy.
