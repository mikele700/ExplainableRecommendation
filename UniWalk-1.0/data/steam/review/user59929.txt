ONe of the biggest P2W games ive ever seen! you cant achieve anything unless you pay a monthly subscription, unless you like walking around doing nothing looking at the map. and unless you subscribe and you are trying to enjoy it, Trion will think your a bot and ban your account for no reason, and if you try doing an appeal you wont be getting an answere for a week or so.
The game may seem very interesting and fun, but its very unoptimised and after 10 hours you will be thinking, why did i spend my cash on this crap. The game lacks interest when you get late game gear and the map is very small.
Wow i could of bought myself a burger and would be happer than this crappy rip-off game.
Another wonderful game by Paradox!
Best 4x turn based game out there! enjoyed hours on this game!
i bought this game for 30c with this coupon i got from a badge i crafted. i then sold all the cards i got and made 60c. so in the end i got a free game and 30c. FTW!
Recommended highly!
