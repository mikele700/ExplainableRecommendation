Once i started to play this game i was hooked, with game play and an art style that wont age this game will keep you intersted for a while. The community in this game can be toxic some times but otherwise is quite friendly. Trading in this game is very intesting with an extremly large community for a fps game. I would recomend everyone to play this game as it is free to play and free to uninstall.
