So far this game is incredible, the landscapes are amazing and the dinos are fun to play with.Everytime i join the game i fall into a herd of herbs and we travel around the Isle defending the Puetras from T-Rex armies!If i were to recommend something for this game, it would be to fix the puetra loads of people love this class but it deals no damage = easy prey. But otherwise i have had a ball playing this game and recording it, I highly recomend it.
