This is a really good game to mellow out to with your favorite soundtrack. To appreciate the full experience of this game, I would reccommend buying a controller.
Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is its soundtrack, and its 80's aethetic. The fact that you have to go through Uplay to play it makes accessing the game a little difficult. If you can work your way around Uplay and still be interested in the game, then you are going to love this. It's a cheesy game, but that's all part of the charm.
