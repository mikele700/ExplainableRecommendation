I cant recomend this for any Aus/Nz players as there is no servers for us unless you dont mind playing with 400+ ping. Other then that the battles seemed pretty fun, will try it again if they add asian/aus servers.
Perfect example of a good F2P game, Id recomend this to anyone since its free and actually really fun.
Yes ! its what iv been waiting for, if you like 4x games, Europa Universalis ect ect you should love this and for only 40$ Give it a go you wont regret it !!!!
Alright, i NEVER write reviews but this game is DOPE !!!. Im havning more fun playing this then witcher and fallout 4 combined !. Foreal tho this game one of them games that get you hooked. Its hard it dont hold your hand like most games these day mad for kids ha ! anyways Buy it play it, dont like it ? return it. but you wont, give it an hour and u will like it too if u like RPGs--♥♥♥♥ Dope Yo !--
Very addictive and fun !
