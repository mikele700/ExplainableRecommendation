Freddy Got Fingered is a really good game, my favorite bit was when we spent 4 nights at Franco's Pizza Plaza Pie Place. IF you enjoy getting a bit spooked, I don't reccomend this game, Pewdiepie has told me that this is very spook and he pooped his pants and accidently got his dog pregnant. I don't know how, he must have missed step 3. I give it a shameful 9/6, would definetely get fingered again.
