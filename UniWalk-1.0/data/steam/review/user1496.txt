This game is boring and badly made.
THIS GAME IS AMAZING. PLAY IT.
A fun, cheerful, hilarious and challenging little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a game. Think Dark Souls crossed with Castle Crashers and Mario.
This is a fun and challenging game.
Fantastic 1940s war simulator. The plane controls are fun and the battles are challenging. The only letdown is the tanks and the microtransactions
