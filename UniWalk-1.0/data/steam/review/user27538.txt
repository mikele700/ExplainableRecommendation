Waited for this game for two years! 100% worth the wait. The game has so far exceeded all of my expectations. They have many references from the book which makes me happy as I had read half of them. I recommend this to anybody that loves RPGs or just want to play a solid game.
I've only just walked around and run through some of the tute stuff, but it's a great game so far! Nice scenery, vibrant sounds and I can see a lot of potential - far more than what I saw from the trailers. It's $15 dollars guys, perfectly worth it IMO.
Such an amazing game, especially when playing on -Ranger Hardcore- difficulty. Really gives you a glimpse of the hardships and shortage on supplies and ammo people would go through under such circumstances like an apocalypse. The story is great and the fact that to get a good ending relies on more than just simple choices really makes this game. Try it out guys! And play its predecessor Metro 2033 first.
