Metal Gear Rising Revengeance isnt your average Metal Gear game. The stealth that you are used to in the old metal gear solid games have been completly dropped. There are still little sections with a touch of stealth but there is barley any stealth. Its more a hack and slash game but a dam good one. Keep in mind that Platnium Games made the game. Kanomi only published the game. Still this is one spin of game that is worth a shot. The soundtrack is freakin BADASS and fits each battle perfectly. I suggest you play with a controller as a keyboard and mouse is kind of shonky. I havent finished the game but im past half way and im having a great experience. You dont have to have played any of the previous Metal Gear games to understand whats going on. Definiatly worth giving it a shot.
