Really fun gameplay and incredibly interesting graphics make this game an awesome title to pick up, coupled with it's good soundrack, sound design and story. It's also the right length and has interesting story arcs and twists, upgrading and collecting is fun to forge new armor and attachments, and isn't farmy at all. The main characters have their moments and are well thought out, while some minor characters are a bit annoying and not acted well. Replayability is there, but there isn't much to do after you've collected all the Friends from other indie games.All in all, buy it. On sale? It's usually three bucks, but waiting for a sale isn't worth it for this game. Buy it right now.
