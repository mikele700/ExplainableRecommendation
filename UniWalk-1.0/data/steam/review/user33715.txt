Without a doubt this is a good game, if you are interested in game development. I see a lot of reviews saying that this game really moved me, or it will change your life. But for me it didn't, not to say that this game isn't emotional or moving would be wrong. On one side it's a story of someone who loves making games that are different in every way, and then his friend made him lose his interest somehow or something along those line. On the oother side it a story of a person who deeply cares about his friend and wants to help him somehow but things don't go as planned. I don't see this as a sad game, I see it as an old friend try to get in contact with another friend to rebuild their friendship. Anyway make of it what you will, im just another guy on steam.
