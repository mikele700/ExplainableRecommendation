Despite the very limited amount of time I've played this brilliance that some people call a 'game'. I have decided that this will now become my life. I am deeply immersed into the life of this pixelated pug, venturing gracefully through the lands, dodging (and sometimes becoming impaled by) things left and right.The incredible sound booming throughout this virtual world is like no other. The stunning fluid and competitive gameplay truly astounds me.I am in love.
What can I say? This is one of the most addicting, challenging, awe-inspiring arcade games I have ever played. And I wouldn't have it any other way. Mono (dev) has hit the nail on the head with this one. The perfect combination of fluid, snappy motion and consistant projectiles makes controlling the pixelated 2D spaceship an absolute dream. Along with it's easy to use menu system, with simple but balanced ship customisation, it creates the type of game that is so easy to just start up, and get stuck into. Not only that but the modern arcade style visuals with dynamic feeling backgrounds and enemies makes it a very good sight for sore eyes.The feeling you get when you just beat your personal best, or absolutely dominate it by managing a score in the millions is nothing but pure acomplishment and satisfaction. At the time of writing this review I just managed to pull off a 13.7 million score run on Normal mode (just over 50 minutes of constant fast-paced action).Despite my short few hours of play time, I can already say this is an extremely well executed game and would highly recommend it to anyone who finds themselves wanting a fast-paced, exciting and beautiful game, that will surely last them a lifetime. As there is always a chance of beating that highscore one more time...
Quickscopes for days. 360/10
