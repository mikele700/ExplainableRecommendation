Pretty epic game. Workshop maps are awesome especially those maps which help you with your aiming. Overall great game for those who like teamwork and like to kill people :P.
Gameplay is good. But then it's the ArmA series, the servers are not optimized properly, even with high-end hardware your bound to get low FPS. Until they actually get their ♥♥♥♥ together and optimize the game. It's a NO from me :P.
EPIC game! Must buy while its on sale. So addicted!!
Awesome game. Sooo good for it being still in Early Access, I can see that this game has ALOT of potential. Good job!10/10
