-I am depressed, so I will get this game to help me, it looks very fun and happy-. These were my sons last words before he commited suicide the next day. He played this game for about an hour, he then grabbed a pink cucumber and slit his earlobe. He turned into a satanic elephant. This game was made by the Illuminati. My son wasted his life on it. Please tell gaben. Now all my son does is scream for Nyx to stop, the evil, evil Nyx. Why didn-'t he just stop playing while he could. 10/10 will help a four year old pink elephant out of a park bench while screaming -I can fit the whole thing in- again.
I want to die
