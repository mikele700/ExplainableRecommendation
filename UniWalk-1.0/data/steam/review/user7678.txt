Slightly annoyed that i bought multiple copies to trade for items then the next week this game was made free to play.
Takedown: Red Sabre is a one-of-its-kind for our current games that are avaliable, i find this game challenging but rewarding with each room cleared the more assured of victory i am, This game makes you look tactical and feel like James Bond i highly recommend buying and playing this with friends, if you are looking for a DIFFERENT FPS than the usual i would chose this. I find personally the silence around corners chilling but soothing, a different take then a high intense action game with the main objective to get HyperKills and PentaDeaths. This game keeps me on my toes and changes the spawns of Ai on every new lobby created. 9/10 based on originality and focus.

Its a good game but the excitment only lasts for untill you go bankrupt and the only way to progress is do everything you've aleady done. 3/5 Crumpets
