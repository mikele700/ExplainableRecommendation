Good game but crap gameplay, enemy can spawn camping using unlimited gas bomb kills everyone instantly after they spawn. My first match was terrible, the system match all newbies in 1 team vs all high score players...so IMBA!
it's nice but...those machineguns...crazy op than snipers, less recoil, more ammo, easy headshots from far away than sniperthey just rush and shoot everywhere we all die GGUI menu is ugly, very confusing
First time ever played underwater game, it was awesome and so fun playing as diver which adventure through danger sharks attack in dark sea and collecting treasures, very exciting. When bored of diver, go play as a shark and murder all the humans muhahaha MEAT MEATTTTTT!
