This is a great military simulator, much like ArmA2 but completely improved graphics, dialogue etc. The campaign is pretty long and there is also enough scenarios to keep you busy for a good 30+ hours solo, but after that there the multiplayer which is 100% more fun with friends. Overall, great military simulator.. but it is a SIMULATOR, this isn't Call of Duty fellas, yes there is bang bang in every mission, but it it a simulator (cannot stress enough)! If you want to get the most fun out of this game then you need to role play and not go all CoD style and run and gun everything with 2 legs (save that for multiplayer). Appart from that, I had many hours of enjoyment and many more to come!
Great, fun and creative game with friends!
