An enginering game with all units in imperial?
I can't recomend this game yet. Far to incomplete.Will recomend when physics are working to playable level
In this demonic wooden machine simulator, ye take command of a wooden cart possessed by demons.The goals of the game are simple and varied enough. Destroy all the things. Move this rock here.Unfortunately the only building matierial for frames appears to be rotten balsa wood.Also lacking is torsion springs, rope, slings and seige engine crew for reloading weapons... Thus this is a terrible catapult simulator. You can however make excellent flaming lawnmowers of death...
Lego spaceships with realistic physics...
While some of the missions are highly liner, the combat system is very enjoyable and challenging. Beating up people is very satsifying. Gunplay however is passable. I would rather beat the crap out of everyone than shoot them simply because it's more satisfying. Driving mechanics are very simple so don't expect any realism from the cars here, however motorbikes (despite their unrealisic behavour) are plenty fun to race around town on.
It's a free above head shooter that's great to play with friends. Terrible if your playing alone however.
Do you like Elder Scrolls Games? Do you like fighting dragons? Do you like shooting people in the knee with arrows? Then this is the game for you. You will lose days in this game. Espically if you like collecting things, or exploring for hidden tombs to plunder. The tombs and quests have a nice variation although their consequences are hardly felt.I find it best enjoyed with a 360 pad, but most people play with a mouse and keyboard just fine.
