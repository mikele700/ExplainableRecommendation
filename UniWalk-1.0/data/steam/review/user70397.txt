Outstanding game, One of the best I have ever played so far. Vermintide really has some potential and I am positive that it will only get better and better from hear on out. It gives a new hope for the Warhammer Fantasy world since the devastating fall of Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning, which I loved to bits.Warhammer: The End Times - Vermintide will not disappoint YOU!
Beautiful just beautiful 10/10. If only everyone thought like Dropsy. <3
Meh.
Simple, yet unusually entertaining!
The idea of the game has potential, The camera is terrible and goes all over the place. Very glitchy and needs some TLC all in all the COULD be a good game but isn't.
