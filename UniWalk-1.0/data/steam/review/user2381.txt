Just a rant about those who judge a game off its graphics and not off the actual game itselfOk 90% of gamers, you can ♥♥♥♥♥ an whine about arkham knight not having ultra graphics settings or hitting 60fps. the other 10% will play the game and couldnt give a **** whether batman has rain droplets on his cape.my pc is at least mid-range, i run everything on low and barely notice a difference. remember no arkham game (or any game for that matter) shipped out bug free on the pc.i wont sit there staring at a close up view of batman or an object and pick out all the graphical errors. whether you-'re gliding in the air or speeding through the streets these are things you wont notice cause when it comes down to it you-'re a badass batman in a badass batmobile doing badass stuff. so at the end of the day you can all enjoy not playing arkham knight and not being batman while the rest of us can just have fun playing the game.now just a quick thing on the game so faralso the story is great so far, really loving the new batmobile :D the -big reveal- for the totally originally original character, Arkham Knight isnt as original as one might hope, especially if you-'ve got a basic knowledge of the batman lore. all in all Arkham Knight is the perfect end to the run of Arkham games. the series will be missed :(Check out this Funhaus video, it explains everything about the graphics and why people shouldnt get so worked up over ithttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r-VTNyuNYAto those saying Arkham Knight is ♥♥♥♥, **** youand to those saying Arkham Knight is great, hope your experience is as enjoyable as mine is :)
