Amazing so far, you'll start off in a multiplayer server and maybe you'll meet some people.. you might kill them or might make friends.. or tie them up then slowly torture them in a cave. after that you'll probably be ambushed by the bane of your very existence, Stygmilochs before getting a actual camp set up, You will build a small shelter. After that  you'll survive for a bit before getting your first herbs and taming a Dinosaur.. after that you'll either become a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and kill everyone on sight or help newbies.
