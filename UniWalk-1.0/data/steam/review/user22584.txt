One of the best games I've ever played, really funny and emotional no matter what choices you make. The characters are all so memorable and easy to like, and not to mention the music for everything is A+. 10/10 would play for a 4th time.
Incredible game, I love playing this even though the monsters are hella scary when they charge at you.
