This was a wonderful experience. The story is well-written, and honestly, it prompted me to reflect on the value and shortness of life. It's a short visual novel, but it powerfully evokes emotions in the brief time we get to know the protagonist and Setsumi, whose lives are made brief due to their respective illnesses. Though the characters are distant at first, there is an intimacy between the them that develops which was touching and the soundtrack and voice track simply enhance the experience. For a doujin work, the artwork is quite well done and the minimalistic approach of presenting the setting and characters allowed me to have a more personalized experience with the story. The rare moments when I actually got to see the Setsumi's face actually felt precious. I really liked this approach. However, I did notice some inconsistencies with some of the art, but it was not terribly noticeable.It's a touching story about two terminally ill patients who are unhappy with their situation, who go on a search for a place that they can die peacefully. It's a tear-jerking story and it is well worth the time.
