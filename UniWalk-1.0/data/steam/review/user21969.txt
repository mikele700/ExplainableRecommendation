Such a great game with a good concept! If only it was 100% free. Well yeah, its free to download, but if you really want to stay competitive in the game, you gotta somehow win agaisnt beefed up opponents that have purchased ingame content, this is done very very slowly, or you can just spent the same amount you would buying any other game up front. Leaving the money making side of it out, the game is really competitive and fun but its already lacking more maps as it gets repetitive quick.
