Its what Diablo 3 should of been!
TO be honest its pretty Meh.The over hyped my career mode isnt your career at all. You have no choices and just play along as some made up guy with a BLACK TWIN SISTER! Im a white kid from outback West Australia! How is that giving me any choice? its the opposite to me. The gameplay itself is improved and alot more of a simulation. THe online is horrible. Noone on and lag, DC's.Still no create-a-team option to use offline in a season mode.
On sale at $28 this is worth every cent!
*VERY EARLY REVIEW*To have a brand like SOny back you, delay the release 3 days, things should be workign that just are not. I do love the game and I'm having fun 3 hours in but the stuttering, horrible looking objects renderign in, not being able to bind lots of keys and a few other things just should not be there for a full release, near on full price game. In its current state it should be a $20, early access game. Now that would get people keen for a full release with all the promised features added instead of the negiative revies the brought on themselves.
