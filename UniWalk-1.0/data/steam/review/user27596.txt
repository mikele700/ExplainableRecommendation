it has memorys it was my first game ever on steam but i dont like it as much as i used to it used to be awsome but now its filled with little kids and tryhards :( Still Good
i play way too much of this game..
Very Repetitive Good If Your Looking for a little time waster game
The Nostalgia Is Strong With This One
Although I Havnt Played Long, The Hour I Have Played Was AmazingThere Are So Many Items In This GameI Like The Store FeatureKilled Someone Made Him Rage 10/10 Would Kill Again XD10/10 i might actually go play some now :)
Probably the most time of my life spent in it and i barely go on steam 10/10 ign
