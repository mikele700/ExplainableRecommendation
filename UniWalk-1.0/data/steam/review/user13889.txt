Absoulutley Amazing 9/10

ive played this before it was on steam done most everything in it. i reckon its an amazing game for its time and it still is fun to play now love it 9 and a half out of 10
is very good!
Is good you buy now yes you buy now yes? very in depth strategy game and complex it takes some getting used too but very fun and enjoyable especially WHEN THE AI MADE NINETY FOUR MEGA MASSIVE FLEETS OF DESTRUCTION and the war rages till this day. lol
