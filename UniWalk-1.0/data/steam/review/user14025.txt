Who would have thought driving and managing a truck company would be fun
Cookie Clicker on steroids
Addictive gameplay and the loot just makes you want to explore further
Great fun would recommend.But,doesn't have a normal mode, only time attack and other modesLeaderboards have heaps of exploiters
At first it can be a little confusing but once you get the hang of it it's pretty addictive.
A very simple yet fun game to play when you don't have much do to.
