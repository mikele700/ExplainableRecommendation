I like this. It's got basic rules that beginners can understand and runs well at high framerate on nearly every computer. Does have a few glitches though here and there but still, in my oppinion, it's a great game for the franchise.
Ahhh, Yes very good. GG. 11/10..... The best part of this game is Defecation...
