This game is UNREAL. So much fun playing it and its only Pre-Alpha. The physics in the game are so realistic, I've been waiting for a racing game to produce that forever! Not to mention the graphic detail they put into the destruction of the cars! Overall this game is a 10/10 in my books. The future looks extremely promising and i'm sure the game will only get better!! Short Form - Well worth the money, you will not be disappointed.
Yes i do recommend this game it has good graphics, good story and everything to make a good horror game..
This game is ideal for any fan of the TV series - The Walking Dead- it has it all action suspense just like the original TV show TRY IT OUT!!!
This is a totally recommend!! worth the money every bit, if you like history but don't like to be bored then this is your type of game it's basically a history lesson with action in it!! Well Worth your buck!! the graphics are perfect for the time of this game was released..
