it is the best game every i love it you should play it, i've already stabed my self with 100000 stimpacks bra
when i first got this game i thought i would get to have fun with my friends but then they started playing LOL. so i was left by my self.when my friends came back they where suprised to see i had skins and they said i was spending a lot of money what they did not rember it had bin two month since the last time i spoke to them about the game.when i got to play with them one did not whant to play with me so he killed him self with a nade.i don't play the game to much any more but i did have a lot of fun then and a little now.
i played the witcher 3 story quest 3 times to get it right and i had fun every time but the first time i played it, it was amzing I was blow away by how good it was and still is, the story is EPIC, the  variety of characters is awsome and its one of the features that make this game great ,and the nice little touch of being able to grow a bread is.....isimmersive as f**k. 11/10 spoiler are down below so don't look at them -the first time I played it i was having the time of my life doing the story then restaring becuse i scewed  up the ending(every one else got a happy end i got the sad ending me and ciri died)-the second i got the happy ending for me ciri and triss but the rest of the people got the sad ending -3rd time ciri lived and became a witcher,i lived and romaced triss, and every one else lived happy ever after.
i took me 77 min to beat the game and i was having fun the entire time with problem solving with trying to find out how to talk. it was a grate way to pass the time
mirror's edge is for pepol how like parkcore and AC fans. I liked the game over all 5 stars it will run on pc a laptop thats good i do recommended it
