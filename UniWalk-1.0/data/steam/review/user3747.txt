This game is an open-world science-fiction third-person shooter with absolutely beautiful graphics. One of the many things that this game lacks is a decent incentive to keep playing as the gameplay consists of very mundane and repetitive tasks.  I would recommend this game only to people who enjoy the grindiest of grindfests.
