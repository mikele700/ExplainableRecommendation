I'd say this is an extremely well done visual novel and well worth the price. Besides some translation issues (which they are working on) the game is pretty much flawless in my opinion.I finished my first playthrough at ~5 hours and I'm fairly certain I got one of the worst, if not the most depressing ending.  The dude became mental and lived the rest of his life by himself  But, that's all the more reason to keep playing right?
Twisted, sick, and gorey violence greatly amped up from the original. Disgustingly worth it.
The soundtrack... wow.Simplistic yes, but the mechanics and concept of the game are really well polished. Absolute Drift is both a relaxing and skill testing game. [Easy to learn, hard to master] Some might be turned away by the price, but I think it's an experience that's worth it.
