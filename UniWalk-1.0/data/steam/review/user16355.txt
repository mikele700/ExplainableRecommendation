Pretty simple fast paced shooting arcade game with ridiculously good music.10/10 would just use the sword instead of the gun.
Short story with more puzzles rather than the actual rpg and good artwork. Probably could use more sprites or extra stories.10/10 would poke Efina again.
A good relaxing idle game.10/10 would rob the loot hero for gold again.
