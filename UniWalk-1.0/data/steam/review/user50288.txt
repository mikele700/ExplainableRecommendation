When are they fixing this game, it is so broken, i don't appreciate being juked by warner bro, like???, the fps never gets higher then 3 fps and when it does it's in the cinematics that also lag...
This game looks pretty and runs well. I would HIGHLEY reccomend this game it is updated often and with every update brings lots of content. The building is good for early access and for a small team is amazing. The multiplayer is good and runs fine as long as the host has a good internet/computer.Buy it.
PLAY IT
