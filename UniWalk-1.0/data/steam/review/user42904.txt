After 100 hours on this game I have mixed feelings, but overall I am dissopointed, at first I thought this game is the best TW game out there, but once I started to play the game more and delve deeper into it, I found many problems. From the broken AI both in battle and campaign, the stupid polictical mechanics and the boring soundtrack I found myself bored. However this game is still fun, it just could of been so much more. If this is your first TW game this will blow your mind but if you, like myself, have been playing the series since Shogan 1 or Rome 1 you will not be happy with this game.tl;drGet it if this is your first TW gameIf you have been playing since the original titles you will be dissopointed
