As far as co op is concerned, its great.the ai is laughable, but hey, go on bad ♥♥♥ mode, take away the hud and see how you go.on your own i can see how its bit of a drag, but with co op. eh, its worth it.(now atm it has this really annoying relaunch bug where the game will re open itself after closing causing a loop... annoying and hope it is fixed asap.)
