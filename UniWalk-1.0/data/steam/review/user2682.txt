This game is good. Sure, the gameplay isn't much different from other 3rd person, cover based shooters, but the story is where this game shines.Pros:Good storyDecent controlsStill looks pretty good after 3 yearsPlays well.Cons:Game is short, I finished my first playthrough in 6 hoursGameplay can get a bit repetitive.Verdict: I would say pick the game up when you can.
This game is a ridiculous, open world, action game that is just plain fun to play. The story is ridiculous and some of the missions parody other games and even some movies. This game is ridiculously fun and I would recommend it to anyone who asked me about it.
