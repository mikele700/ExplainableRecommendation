If there-'s a game that did nearly as well as the -wololo- of AoE 1, it had to be AoE2. In a rare instance where a successor elevates a well-loved game to the realm of competitive possibilities, AoE2 set the platform for further sequels and while it will never be Starcraft, AoE remains what it is: a forerunner.
This is the mothership - hovering high above every other game of its genre. It has spawned CS, TF2 and several other team-based co-op shooters. TFC lives on.
