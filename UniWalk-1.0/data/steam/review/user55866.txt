Great Game! It was definetley worth buying and I would give it a 10/10
First Question I asked. How do I get a stick! Still don't know and have barely played this game but from what I can see, I think I am going to thorougly enjoy it
This Is An Amzing Game. It Is Fun Trying To Complete Deliveries Or Just Drive Around With The Video Quality Settings On Ultra And Enjoy The View. This Game Sounds And Even Looks Quite Boring, But Once You Start Playing It, It Is Very Hard To Stop And Is Tonns Of Fun. If You Are Questioning Buying This Game, Just Do It. I Can Almost Garentee You Will Not Regret It.
Spent so many hours on this game on console, so I thought it would only be fair to buy it for PC. Definitely Worth It. :) .
SO MUCH FUN!
An Excellent Game. This game has been an full on adventure and I highly recommend it any Gamer out there :)
Great Game, loads of fun :)
