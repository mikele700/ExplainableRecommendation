looks like advanced warfare........... but besides that i think its worth giving a try again.
cool
I spent 50 bucks on this, my friends paid 80 bucks on this and this goes free2play???!!??!! WTF turtle rock you CASH GRABS!!!! I DIDNT EVEN GET ANYTHING LIKE SKINS OR EXCLUSIVE SH** WTF I HATE YOU CASH GRABS WHO TAKE MONEY AND DONT GIVE BACK. ID RATHER PLAY DAMN LEFT 4 DEAD, THAT REPETITIVE ♥♥♥ GAME THAN THIS. that said this game is still repetitive if not more repetitive than damn l4d or l42. other than your average hunters you start off with, you need to pay to get hunters, and monsters. i spent 50 bucks i better get something out of this. THIS IS MORE OF A COMPLAINT THAN A REVIEW IM SORRY BUT STILL GIVE IT A TRY BUT STILL JUST DONT SUPPORT THE GAME BY SPENDING AT ALL.....................
THIS GAME IS GOOD, IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND untill it says blacklight prime owner required. the game is good but i didnt want it to be a pay 2 win. parity patch has added, removed and restricted some stuff. so good bye to the free 2 play name. but honestly you can rent, and theres at least 3 weapons available for you when you start. you can perm them. even the ps4 is doing well with the majority of them just non-blacklight prime owner. i think you can enjoy this game with or without blacklight parity. PLAY THIS GAME, GRAPHICS, GAMEPLAY AND CUSTOMIZATION IS ALL HERE!!!! PLAY IT!!!!!
I thnk too repetitive, but wtih the new archwing to ♥♥♥♥ things up a bit i love it. mastery rank 8 but got a long way to go...
sounds fantastic but the problem is the graphics no offence
very popular free to play game,thats all I could say...
