yes
Make sure to double tap! got shot by a bandit and fell unconcious... 2 minutes later i wake up, snek up on them and take them both down. I walked up to their bodies and finished them with a shot to the head each to ensure their deaths.lesson learnt, don't shoot someone and think they're dead, allways make sure they're dead10/10. best survival mmo i've ever played!
I had about a dollar left in my budget and was looking for the most interesting title for that price, and now I can say I found it. Very fun and the soundtrack is great!
the original fps action, better than cod, better fanbase, play equally, community game-modes.9.5/10 would buy.
