Counter Stike - Global Offensive is one of the most best games I have ever played, sure you can rage and get toxic alot at the game, but in the end the game is so good, with all the tournaments, teams to watch and play against, guns to choose from, stickers, skins, what is there more to love about Counter Strike? Sure, in the most recent update, Valve destroyed match making and the rank system making you derank over and over, I got deranked as well, but it makes Counter Strike more of a challenge, and I like that, after deranking from Supreme to LE, I have learnt that you need to play as a team to succeed, and reach the higher ranks.After putting 2,500 hours+ in this game (On 2 accounts) I love it and will never quit, you need to play csgo to understand that it is a great game.But I have to agree Counter Strike does fall in some areas, with Russians, the R8 Revolver, Hackers, and Toxic players (Me). Don't let all of the dislikes of Counter Strike get to you, it is a great game and will always be in my Top 3 favorite games, so if you're thinking about buying Counter Strike, buy it, if you don't like it, try it a bit more, and if after that you still dislike it, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, it's a great game.- AlfaiR
good
