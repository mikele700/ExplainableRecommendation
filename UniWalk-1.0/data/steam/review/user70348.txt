I have garry's mod, team fortress 2 and Dota 2. But I also have broforce and it is my faveourite out of all my games. one year ago I downloaded the demo and i brought it to my school, i gave the game to 2 of my friends and they gave it to people, and they gave it to people and it spread through the school. EVERYONE LOVED IT! the game even kept on going when i went to highschool (this year). everyone that got a tablet had the awesome game i brought in primary school, BROFORCE
