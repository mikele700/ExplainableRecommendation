Rust used to be fun before the major overhaul, nekmin poison seeped into the community that was already poisoned-laced. Our beautiful mountainside base was wiped, ofc as it was the major overhaul, but it was a very good base. Great memories made there, but NOW 12 year olds throw axes at you when you just want to cut down a damn tree. Why? Well perhaps it's because they were on the lower end of the spectrum when they played CoD. I hate you all. I love Rust but hate you all.
This stuff is on another level of kawaii
