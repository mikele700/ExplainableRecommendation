Color Symphony is... okay. Given a bit of polish, maybe a little bit of difficulty added, a graphics overhaul, maybe change the story a little bit (read: start story from scratch), and this would be something I-'d expect to see somewhere like Armor Games, New Grounds, or Miniclip. As it is, the game has a plot that doesn-'t make sense, graphics and story that try to come off as edgy (and fail, hence aforementioned graphics overhaul), and a soundtrack that doesn-'t suit the game. On the other hand, the controls are simple and easy to master for the most part, and the colour change concept is actually pretty clever.However, it could have been implemented a little bit better. Enemies are reasonably easy to dodge, and if you hit one, you simply have to avoid it until your health regenerates, reducing the difficulty level. the erasure of multiple colours is confusing, and not needed after that tutorial level. There isn-'t a life system, so you can start from the start of the level as many times as you want. It also takes ages for the character to recover after being hit. Also, falling off screen is insta-death, which is annoying, as I feel like it should teleport you back to where you fell off, and reduce your health, although that would still be a slap on the wrist due to the regenerating health.So, in other words, if I was developing the game, I would not have released it yet. The price of the game is an accurate reflection of how enjoyable it is (not very, due to rather quick boredom onset). As such, feel free to have a go, but don-'t be dissapointed when you get bored as I did.Also, as a side note to the devs: I don-'t exactly know how you came up with the name of -Color Symphony-, but the symphony part doesn-'t exacly fit the game.
