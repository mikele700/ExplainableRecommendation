Truly a lovely visual novel that dares to be different.
Most fun free-to-play horro game
I had so much fun playing this game. There were only a few hackers, but at least it isn't as bad as *cough* CSGO *cough*. The community is alright and overall its a thumbs up.
I may have been late for the party, but this game knows how to keep things interesting and engaging. I love all the characters (except monokuma) and it's challenging. Love the game. Recommend it.
What was once a terrific, skill-based and popular first-person-shooter is now a piece of trash. Every time you join a server, there will always be ~2 hackers. After playing this for +1500 hours and suffering wraths of toxic hackers, you ought to save up your $15 USD for a better first-person-shooter. The dream is dead.
Good casual shooter. The only thing I dislike is the tank. Aiming is sluggish, but keep up the good work!
Now I know what your thinking, OMG its a horrible version of Counter-Strike 1.6, but actually its not bad at all. Sure there are swarms of bugs and issues, but its a Beta, so expect loads of improvments when the game becomes an Alfa.
The game is quite intense when it comes to finding food, water, ammunition, fuel and medicine in order to survive. I like how you can drive cars and run over zombies and animals with it. I like how guns can be customised with scopes to increase accuracy. I like how you can even farm for food, so you don't have to go out and hunt for food. However, I find the zombies to be a bit OP, but once I build up my items and weild weapons they're not much of a threat. Just make sure you check your surroundings before you open up your inventory, I almost died doing so. So should you download and support this game? Definately!!
This is a very good documentory that really touched me, even for players who never play Dota 2.
