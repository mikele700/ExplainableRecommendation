Not my style.
What i like about this game is that at the start you are fustrated you die so easily until you unlock other classes, achievements, which changes the gameplay alot. What else is good it's not a pay to win, you dont pay money ($) to get in-game bonuses or anything. In my opinon it's a great game and i reccomend it.
It's good 10/10 and you actually need to learn how to build your vechile when you start the game off, you don't know what to do and how to do it that that happened to me at the start. I just did a game still didn't understand then my brother played it and saw what to do so there shoould be a tutorial when new players start the game.
For some reason i can't do the mmo beta but still 10/10 can someone help me?
