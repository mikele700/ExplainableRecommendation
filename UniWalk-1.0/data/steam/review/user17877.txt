♥♥♥♥ you overkill. You said no microtransactions...What kind of developer lies to their most dedicated fanbase????-From a player who owns PDTH and pre ordered Payday 2
My first ever ARPG genre game. Soft learning curve, large landscape to explore. NOT a game of guns blazing and terrorist killing  but a detailed social commentary regarding to the past, present and future of the human race. Simply Beautiful.
