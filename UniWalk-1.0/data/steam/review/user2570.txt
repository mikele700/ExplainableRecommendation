Excellent a must have for Halo fans. considering that this game was made for windows phones and tablets the visuals are amazing. The only down side to this game is that coop has been removed.
100% RNGESUS 10/10
A true master piece of a game 101+ hours of playing time is the proof for this. Also with mods skyrim can becomes a completely new game in short if you don't mod the game you are playing it wrong.
