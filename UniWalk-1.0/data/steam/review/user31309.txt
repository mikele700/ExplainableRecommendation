I understand that this is in alpha but is there any reason that zombies teleport through ♥♥♥♥ing doors and various levels?also major rubber banding and I was on a server with less than 50ms of ping.Also players glitching through walls onto rooftops which you cannot get off unless you kill yourselflike honestly i swear a bunch of 1st year game designers and programmers would do a better job than the bunch in control of this game..
