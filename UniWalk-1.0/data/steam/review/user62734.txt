Well, this game was good, but a few things have ruined my fun.These include:-Amount of low levels which go into games not knowing what to do then completely screw you over-Stat and Team boosters-Liars! (We all know who I'm talking about)-A drill you have to buy with real money even though you use the same exact one for multiple missions, with a different paintjobWell, I still try to enjoy this game and ignore the large flaws that have been implemented in the game. It has worked, so far, but there will probably be something that ruins my experience AGAIN, later on. Buy it, and enjoy the game while you can.
