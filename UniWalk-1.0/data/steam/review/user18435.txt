Most of the likes here are a result of frustration bred from the inability of SC5 to cater for their die-hard SC-series fans. But now it has changed. People are actually liking this game because of the goodness it offers. And we all can't wait for after dark. Just when you think things can't get any better, Collosal Order does it again.
