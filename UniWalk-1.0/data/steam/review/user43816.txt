great with teh friends
Great classic.
A must play.
A fully confusing, profound and stunning game. I lost track of the amount of screenshots I took, the skies in this game were something to behold. Dispite the inability to run, jump or do anything other than  expore, this is a journey that is emensely complex, travelling a beautiful landscape while and going through letters being read to. A game that makes you feel emotions like none other.
This was so amazing, it hurt my brain just playing it... A must play.
