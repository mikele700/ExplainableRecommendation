After everything i achieved in this game *Rowing through your rubber raft*Rowing while you are on land*Killing a shark with a knife*Not having to bend over anymore because of my spear that and pick up anything*Leaving the crash site not caring about the pilots*Many more shenanigans!Throwing crabs is my favourite!
