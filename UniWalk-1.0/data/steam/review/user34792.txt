  POSITIVES:  Good graphicsGreat campaignAwesome Zombies experience  NEGATIVES:  There are none!Overall, this is a truly amazing Call of Duty game. I would recommend this to any COD fan. 9/10 
I remember playing this on the PS1 and it was just awesome. Worst thing of all is I never knew it was available for PC! I-'ve been playing this for a while now and all the memories came rushing back to me. Good times...This is one of my favourite games of all time. I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a good old retro platformer puzzle game.10/10, would say -Hello- again.
Recently bought this for custom zombies (because of the weekend sale). Definitely worth it.The amount of custom zombie maps is incredible. There are thousands, possibly millions, of custom maps to play on. The best part is how the game supports guns from BO1, MW and BO2. If you don't have those games but want to use the guns from them, this is the game to have.This has to be the best Call of Duty game I have played so far.10/10, best zombies experience.
