i like this game very much and i think that the people working on it are doing the best they can to fix it all up. one thing for improvment and something they have not mentioned coming out anytime soon in the workshop. this game would benifit from having mods that you can easily get from steam (i have got mods but it would be good to have workshop to make it easier). and i have had a few games that are a bit glitchy with building falling from the sky (the crap metal you get is good tho). keep up the good work fellas.
