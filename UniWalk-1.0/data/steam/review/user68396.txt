You Die & you'll lose everything. All that progress gone to waste. STILL FUN THOUGH :D
I got annoyed with this game all too quick honestly. Constantly being revived right near a damn zombie, and they can spot you from what seems like miles and miles away. Good survival game if you have the tolerance.
