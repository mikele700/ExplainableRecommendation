Spawn in, get wood, stone and flax fibers. Make a spear and a wooden shield. Find a player, team or kill. Take loot. Make a base that looks epic. Go into caves and get copper and tin to make bronze in a furnance. Craft a sword by running a rough blade through the furnance and then beat the hell out of it with a hammer on the anvil. Use the smithy to finish it off. Get hide armour. (There is hide, bronze and iron armor which are ubgradeable) (Armor parts are crafted individualy) Make a bow. Hunt, make a boat. Go to another island and get iron. And then die. Start over until you get it right. Awesome battles in the ocean with ballistas and bows (I torched their boat) LoL. Great game. No guns only a bow as as ranged weapon and picks, axes, clubs, swords, hammers etc as a close quarters weapon. Really a very good game. The pvp is about skill(Mostly) Get It if in doubt. Didnt like it just ask for a refund.
Best survival game ever made. Even without the vehicle, bases and a ton of bugs the game is already better than the arma mod. Only the vehicles, less lag with the shadows and bases this game will be ultra outstanding, I have a mac and i can run it using Wineskin, it is ridiculously easy to do so. Even if you use mac buy the game. Tutorial Wineskin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcYhO0fX9jYIf you have a mac then there is your tutorial of how to play windosw steam games on MAC. You can make textures poor if you have a slow computer bt if you have a mac its not needed.
Game is nice n'all but there should be oficcial servers. I mean all admins are godded and pvping with spawned loot. Really annoying :/
Best. All is said
