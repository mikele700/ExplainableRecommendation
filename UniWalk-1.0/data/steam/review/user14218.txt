My childhood in a nutshell and its a still an amazing game.
Great game 10/10
Its an amazing game my childhood all over again. 1 problem though its so buggy, every time I load my game it starts the prologue despite I finished it and I'm past the part where you meet Han for the first time. Travellers Tales please fix your game I have seen so many bugs.
Great game you gotta love all the modes in this game.
