It's like pokemon if it only had grass and sometimes the normal grass enemies had more health and special abilities, and after the 4th area you have seen everything, Until you find the special arenas which take tons of people to do, and are hard to find and you have to make keys which take doing almost hundreds of the same repetetive dungeons you've been doing since the start. after that you need to get to max level (level 20) plus upgrade items to do a area that is a little different than what you've already been doing in the regular area. by the time you are level 15 the game gets extremely grindy, with two terrible ways of leveling, one is going to a area that you can barely beat enemies at or go to a easy area where get barely any XP. both of these strategies still take way too long to keep the game interesting. After you do that you have to start grinding for tons of a really rare item to actually upgrade your weapons so you can be a higher level to be able to get to the uber 6 world (which takes being level 36+), by then you have most likely already seen all there is to see, other than mounts and pets which won't help the game be less repetetive.
