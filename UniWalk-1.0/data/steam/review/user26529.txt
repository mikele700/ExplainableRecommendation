Do not pay attention to the negative reviews since they're all riddled with nonsense about crashes. Every game has some issues one way or another, from day one to even a week or two. My copy of the game runs perfectly well, aside from two crashes at the first two bonfires, which there is an easy fix to(set lighting graphics to low), other than that its smooth sailing. From Software has already prepared to release the next patch to improve the optimisation of the game so props that that.10/10 - would die againVICTUS!!!!   DOMINUS!!!  <------Sing in Falsetto :)
