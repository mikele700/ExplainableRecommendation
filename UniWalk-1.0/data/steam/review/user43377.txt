This game is soo good! It's replayability is endless as you can try different heists different ways, full stealth, guns blazing etc. The wide range of masks, patterns and colors make creating masks fun, and collecting them even more fun. It's a great game, prepping me for my next job... oops.
Very fun and addicting, simple and easy mechanics and the game runs smoothly. 8/10Only criticism would be to change the multiplayer system so that we don't have to port-forward, and more classes/worlds. Please.
