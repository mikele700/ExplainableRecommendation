I think it's a really good game but hell what do I know since I havent played since NBAlive08 it's a decently challenging game but easy to get into.
Very fun game it's good for people who have never played these games before easy to understand very easy storyline to follow 8/10 would recommend
I've spent almost 2400hours of my life on this game and dont regret a single one I think thats a good enough review all by its self
I struggled a lot with this game early on finding where I needed to go was a bit hard but this game is a very fun expirence for fans of MMOs the targeting system is possibly the best i've ever seen I totally recommend it for a fun time.
