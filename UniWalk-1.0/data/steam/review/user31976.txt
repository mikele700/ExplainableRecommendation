Tis game has some of the best replayabilty out of any game i have ever played, there so much to do i never felt that there was a time where i could not start up a team and fight against other teams of course there is a bit of a problem where you hate the world after rolling a one but of course its only a d6 so its going to happen alot. the only real problem is if you have to go and you are playing a team that doesnt get alot of touchdowns you have to alt tab and then close the program through task manager as there is no quit game without saving during a match but if that is my main concern then i feel you have no problem picking up this game if you like the concept
