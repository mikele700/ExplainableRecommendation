Well, M&B WB has to be the best game i have ever played. It is so replayable, there are hundreds of different combinations, and then slap on a bunch of Mods! You could be an archer for the vaegirs, A crossbowman for your own kingdom, a knight for the swadians. Then there are mods!The combat is a bit under but still tactical and thrilling when you kill an enemy. Playing Multiplayer is fun with friends... or against... Its very tactical but very unforgiving and newbies may get owned but once you start getting a few hours under your belt, you can win.My latest save is Swadians, the epicness of watching about 150 cavalry storming into the Rhodok lines is exhilarating and quite epic.It is hard to describe its greatness but damn me if it aunt great.
