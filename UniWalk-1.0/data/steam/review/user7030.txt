The whole game i was worried about the guy trapped in the fortune cookie factory. Best $4 i ever spent9/Shia
Man, ♥♥♥♥ you emerly
Some of the jump scares got me really good but the whole time i was amazed by the beauty of everything. I feel robbed not finishing that 5th part after what happened with the ceiling. Did it again just to take a moment and look at it all. Eagerly awaiting more8/Shia
I ate my shrimp, sexted badly, freaked out a little bit when i was looking for the man in the cage and hung myself. I liked the ending though, how you get more options with the ages and methods. I really hope they update this game, love the vibe of it. 10/Shia
