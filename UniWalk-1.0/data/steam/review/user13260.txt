So, this game, for me, is somewhat unique.This was one of the first survival/exploration type games that I have owned (unless you include Minecraft, but that doesn't really count.) and, despite the low amount of hours, I have found it quite an enjoyable game. It is incredibly polished for a game in early access, the graphics are great, and the atmosphere is a solid 10/10. You get a real sense of scale, some monsters that may be implemented would be 10, 20 times your size. And the audio in this game. Just wow.If you want to experience this game fully, you definitely would have to have a good pair of headphones, as there is alot to hear, from the roaring of the Reaper Leviathan, (It's scary as it sounds!) to the quiet ping of the Cyclops as you explore the depths of this alien planet.This game can get pretty spooky, as it gets very dark at night, and basically everything is out to kill you. There is even a fish that will swim towards you and explode. Sometimes, it can get prety tense having to swim up from the floor some 60 metres down to the surface with a limited supply of oxygen, though you can craft al osrts of things to assist you in your diving. The map, though, is not randomly generated, but is made by the devs as they produce the game, and the map is large enough so that you feel you are in quite a large ocean planet. To sum upp, Subnautica is a great game, though at the current point in time, is somewhat lacking in content, and I dont feel a reason to come back to it when I leave to go do something else. One thing that would make the game far better as well would be a multiplayer, co-op gamemode so that friends can join you and you can stuff around and do all sorts of things together.Grahpics 8/10Audio 10/10Gameplay 7/10Thank you for reading my review.
This is a wonderful game, you should get it when the sales are on!
