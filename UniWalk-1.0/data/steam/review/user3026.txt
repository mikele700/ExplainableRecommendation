Oh my god it's so much fun :') I never usually like puzzle games, but this mixture of puzzle, humor and storyline is just perfect! Co-Op is a blast too!

♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game, everyone camps with OP guns. One  of the worst COD games in history that I've played.
I've played many horror games, watched alot of horror movies, and am a seasoned survivor of them. But i still sh*t myself everytime i turn a corner and run into a f*cking barnacle's tongue-thingy.7.8/10 too many barnacles10/10 would sh*t myself again
One of the best Free to Play games on steam at the moment! You don't HAVE to use money to be good at the game, or to buy overpowered guns/classes, you just gotta play the game, get money/coins/currency and buy them (although it's a ♥♥♥♥♥ to grind the cash) Played it for a short time and already it feels like CoD mixed with CS: GO, and I love those two games so it's a 10/10 would play (and maybe even pay for) again!
0/10 The cake was a lie
