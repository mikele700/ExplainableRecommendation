It is a very good game a little little bit buggy but it is REALLY good effort for a 16 year old, i would highly recomend this to anyone who likes rust,dayZ and minecraft so before i end this review i would just like to suggest some guns and equipment a AA12,C4 (probably all ready in the game),less wood to craft things,less time to cut down a tree and a little easier to find things THX!
yes, yes i do
