I saw that you are working on a sequal and I have a suggestion on where it should be set. Mount Massive Univesity.
Goat Simulator is hilarious and I ♥♥♥♥ my pants of laughing when I was riding a bike, getting hit by a truck and car. But I just have one question, how do you unlock the devil goat.
every time i launch it it says UE4 has stopped working
listen this is a good game and all but no offense i dont think its really scary
