Awesome Graphics!!! Extremely cool Shaders too, although it might be a bit laggy sometimes and if you drive into a wall too fast you might glitch. Nevertheless, it is still a great game. It's also great for an Early Access game. ▒█░▄▀ ░█▀▀█ ▒█▀▀█ ▒█▀▀▀█ ▒█▀▀▀█ ▒█▀▄▀█ █ -u3000 ▄ ▒█▀▀▄ ▒█▀▄░ ▒█▄▄█ ▒█▀▀▄ ▒█░░▒█ ▒█░░▒█ ▒█▒█▒█ ▀ -u3000 ░ ▒█░▒█ ▒█░▒█ ▒█░▒█ ▒█▄▄█ ▒█▄▄▄█ ▒█▄▄▄█ ▒█░░▒█ ▄ -u3000 ▀ ▒█▄▄▀
Pay to win... Pay to win... IT'S JUST F***ING PAY TO WIN.You literally have to pay to get everything. And the lag though. Holey Crap.Plus, if you are Germany, you instantly win like wtf man and the hit detection and ranking thing and the friends system are all just bulls**t. Plus, you always get a connection problem if your internet is not the best.NEVER PLAY THIS GAME EVER OR YOU WILL REGRET IT.
One of the best FPS games in my opinion. Great graphics, funny physics, teabagging, stupid deaths and the grenades...they are just awesome. But sometimes you can still glitch dafuq out of your game and your PC might crash when you are picking an M4A4 but nevertheless, it's basically just fun.

I know previously, I did not recommend this game, but after the 1.3 update, I've changed my mind.The 1.3 update actually surprised me. It added a bunch of features to this already fairly contentful game. The feature that I was most excited about was the ability to host multiplayer games via Steam. This was great for me because it meant that I didn't have to use Hamachi or rent a server.So happy now :D▒█░▄▀ ░█▀▀█ ▒█▀▀█ ▒█▀▀▀█ ▒█▀▀▀█ ▒█▀▄▀█ █ -u3000 ▄ ▒█▀▀▄ ▒█▀▄░ ▒█▄▄█ ▒█▀▀▄ ▒█░░▒█ ▒█░░▒█ ▒█▒█▒█ ▀ -u3000 ░ ▒█░▒█ ▒█░▒█ ▒█░▒█ ▒█▄▄█ ▒█▄▄▄█ ▒█▄▄▄█ ▒█░░▒█ ▄ -u3000 ▀ ▒█▄▄▀
Well, first thing's first, right now there isn't much content. This game only has hotlaps and race against A.I. which does tend to get boring. However, graphics are quite nice and gameplay is real smooth. Controls work well for the keyboard, but I gave up trying to calibrate my controller because callibration thing was dodgy and really hard to understand for me, though I think that's more of a personal thing. While I don't particularly dislike this game, I would say just hold off for a little while and wait until a few issues are fixed and more content is available. If you can get it cheap, go for it.Pros:- Great graphics- Quite realistic- Has a lot of potentialCons:- Not many gamemodes- Gets boring after a while- (?) Controller Callibration is dodgy. - Developers have bit of negative reputation.TL;DRDon't buy yet, wait for fixes and more content.
There's no bloody hitboxes and the game is so unbalanced. You can't even aim in this bloody game and it is ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL. The game trys to imitate CoD but failed so damn hard. The only GOOD thing about this game is that it is small. Also, if you live in Sydney, Australia, you cannot find a server under 180 ping. Boo developers. Also, fail attempt at imitating CoD or CS.PEOPLE GO PLAY COD OR CSTRIKE! THEY ARE MUCH BETTER GAMES AND YES I SAID IT, EVEN COD IS BETTER
