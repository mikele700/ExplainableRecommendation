fun game. bit anoying at time. match system is abit slow and longer match times would be better. heard more maps are coming which is good. i spend some time and money unlocking the sniper riffle which i found out was just my same old bolt action raffle i was using with a scope. im much better with out the scope unless camping or flanking. but yes give it a go.
