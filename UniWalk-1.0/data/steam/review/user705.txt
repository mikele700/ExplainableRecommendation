A fantastic follow-up to the brilliant Space-Chem, I find the process of playing this game very similar to programming.  It's all about breaking down problems into smaller components that can be composed to generate a solution. Very rewarding to see a finished solution working.
If Rayman Origins was a puzzle game, that game would be called Toki Tori 2. This game is just so smooth, and I couldn't discern if the graphics were polygon or sprite-based since the game does such a good job rendering the environment.  The puzzles are suitably challenging and the introduction of new mechanics is paced really well.
Closest you can get to Skyrim with guns.
Hands down my favorite game of all time, here is a game that knows what it's about, and doesn't care if you get it or not.  This game is hard, not arbitrarily, but in a way that challenges you to experiement and learn. The setting and story are incredibly deep, and the atmosphere is genuinely haunting and foreboding.
