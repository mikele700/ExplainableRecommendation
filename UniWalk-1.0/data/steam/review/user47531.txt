I don't usually write reviews but for people that enjoy the 'Tales of' series or just JRPG in general, this game will definitely be for you! while quite expensive the gameplay, story and overall characters are quite honestly amazing. Albeit with some iffy camera angles while in battles. All in all a must-get if you like JRPG's ......R.I.P Alisha
