One of my favorite GTA games, if not my favorite. > The storyline is based on Scarface.> The characters are memorable and well developed> The Voice Acting is excellent> The 80's soundtrack is amazing> The 80's Atmosphere is breathtaking for its Miami, Florida influence > The vehicles are fun to drive; Includes Cars, Bikes, Boats, Helicopters, Planes and more> Various weapons, from pistols, smg, rifles, snipers, shotguns to Katana, rpg and minigun. > Can be modded; Have a look at the BTTF mod and Vice Cry Mod.Other infomation> 2003 game, graphics may be outdated but can be fixed by installing the Vice Cry Mod> Widescreen and Ultra Widescreen support> Framerate can be adjusted from 30fps onwards.With that, I highly recommend that you buy and finish this game. You won't be disappointed.
