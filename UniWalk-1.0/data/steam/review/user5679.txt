as a old hardcore melee player this game is suprisingly really fun to pick up. action is fluid and feels like melee can be both fast and slow paced depending whether you play Lucien or Hattori, or even Barraza and Kor. There is a playstyle for everyone. Like ledge guarding? Barazza has really powerful edge guard/gap closer moves. Like hardcore wombo comboing? Say hello to Lucien! it has everything for everyone and i am genuinely suprised
So far this game is very promising, it doesnt punish you when early on but the mechanics are a bit difficult to learn. Great game overall, would recommend to all diehard fighting game fans out there
