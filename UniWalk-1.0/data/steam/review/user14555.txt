This game was one of the most cinematic fps i have ever played. It was so smooth looking throughout the entire game (finished it). The story was complex making it you didnt know what was happening till the end, i know that because i played till the end cause i really liked the story. Overall I will give this game 10/10
If anyone likes to be a detective this is the game built just for you. I love being any type detective (Thats Why Batman is mah favourite) inany type of game get it or ill kill you and be the detective who comes to see the crime scene of your death
Get this game it is the best. Notice the GAME OF THE YEAR AWARD. WHO DOESNT WANT TO BE BATMAN. IF SOMEONE DOESNT TELL ME THEIR ADREES AND ILL KILL 'EM
This game is definetly my favourite game EVER. This game brings you through an emotional path along side with Lara Croft. Stunning graphics, fast movement and motion and brilliant voice acting. I give this game an easy 10/10!
