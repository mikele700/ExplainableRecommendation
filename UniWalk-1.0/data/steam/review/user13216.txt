As much as the game looked interesting and the reviews to go with it. NOBODY in Oceania seems to play this game at all...Oh and only 4 servers? That means less than 50 people can be playing this game
Space Ninja Parkour Third Person Shooter. Didn't expect that now did ya? This game is awesome, the developers care about the community. I have clocked over 450 hours in this game and I have loved every single one. Except this game has two downsides, grinding and repetition. But this is negated with the content the developers release every month.Grinding.This game requires investment, you'll most likely spend most of your hours grinding a boss for a certain warframe or a Void mission for those sweet prime parts. Either way you will kill yourself if you go too long without a break in-between.Repetition.After about 40 - 100 hours, you'll find yourself bored with the game. Login, Choose a void/derelict/normal mission, Rush through instakilling every enemy you see with your maxed out DPS/Crit build of your Boltor Prime or Soma. I've had to take a month break at some of these points and let the game pass me so I can jump back in and grab up the goodies without the rush. Mind you, I have played this game for over a year now.Overall, this game is extremely fun. You can do so many Parkour moves that adds to a space ninja shooter. At the time of writing this the patch version is 14.5.2 and with gamescom over last week. They teased Update 15: Archwing. And some of us, just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ our pants...
