You farm slime poo and sell it for profit 10/10
Poorly optimised, Hard to use interface, Really stuffy ui and for a game centered around mounts the mounts seem to be the least fun thing in the game...
A dude knocked me down i told him i was his long lost brother, we're best friends irl now 10/10
sometimes i like to bury myself in the garden and pretend that im a carrot
Bad game microtransactions and its boring as all $hit
Space ninjas are pretty cool i geuss, textures are kinda eh in places but whatever i can jump around and cut ♥♥♥♥ in half so im happy
