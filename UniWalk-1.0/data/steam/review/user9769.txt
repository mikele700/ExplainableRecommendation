I like the game, it has some great strategic tactical battles, and a nice online presence/ feel.
Loving this game - about 8 missions in and my team feel like serious Special Ops guys, until the obligatory random event or surprise enemy positions happen, and things go downhill rapidly.I really recommend to those who enjoy a good strategy game. The new -visibility- indicator while moving makes it easy to cope with the occasional wierd angle of fire calculations, and the campaign feels like a choice between conflicting priorities, as it should.
