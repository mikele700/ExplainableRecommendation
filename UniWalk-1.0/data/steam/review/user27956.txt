I'm gonna say it this is one of the best sonic games i have played the mix between 2d and 3d levels is amazing the levels are beautiful the story line is a legit sonic story line it offers a bit of challenge unlike the last few sonic games i higly recomend playing this game if you havent
I got this free on ps4 so i decided to buy it on steamI walk into a wall and glitch throughI'm now under the map my gun auto max levels itself the same goes for my jumpsunlock all achievements10/10
Really good game
From what i've seen its an amazing game however i cant play it wothout my laptop crashing even though the specs are higher that the minimum i can get as far as character creation but i will keep trying it's not the first game thats done this to me bu im not going to rate it bad because of my  laptop
This is not a good game infact i hate this game but not because of gameplay because i dont want to play i have to not only is all my money going towards skins all my time is being wasted on it10/10 would play again
