It's a great game to play when you have friends or family around because of the 5 player hotseat that is avaliable. Unlike Civ 5, the turns are quite fast which doesn't  mean you have to wait 5 minutes each turn. It's also fun when you have a 3 man army up against a 20 man army and the 3 are winning and everybody around is shouting. Great game even if your playing against ai.
So much fun just doing custom battles and the story is amazing. Worth $20
