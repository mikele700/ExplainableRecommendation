Played this randomly on a whim, not really expecting too much, but was impressed and really enjoyed it, a lot. found it to be one of the most fun games I've ever played, so much so that it is now one of my top ten favorites.It's well made, since everywhere you look, it's apparent that loads of work has gone into the making of it, (and still is).I'd rate it 9.5 out of 10. when they add Nintendo and Sega characters I'll probably give it the 11/10 it deserves.yknow... I rarely bother to review games, but I almost skipped over this because I nearly let myself be influenced by others' negativity and angry-mob-like opinions. so, I'm adding my own.update: forget everything above. I used to be a fan, but now I am angry like everyone else. di$ney doesn't care about it's PC fans. TLDR; find a different game.
