Simple yet with great replayability. In my opinion does -zombie- hordes and team work better than left 4 dead plus has a global leveling system. Alot of down to earth -zombie- splattering fun for the whole family. Amazed this sort of FPS is so rare.
It's unique and worth a playthrough.
Great atmosphere. The gunplay can be a bit chunky at times but at the end of the day this game is definitely worth it and I hope they do a sequel...so buy the game so I get a sequel!
