the giant of 4xy games returns, it's just as fun as ever, and fixes a lot of the issues that Civ IV had (no more STACKSODOOM anymore)
so much good fun-batman arkham style combat-grapples influenced by awesome Tony Jaa style martial arts (see movie The Protector)-Just Cause style vehicles + vehicle hijacking-awesome music, featuring rustie, flylo, roots manuva, hudson mohawke that'll stay in your head for days-pretty slick graphics-and a robust storyOnly gripe: it was kinda short, and some of the missions felt a bit cut and paste
brilliantly brutal zombiekillin' fun. Only problem is sometimes versus mode feels a bit odd, especially boomer
Fun for a few hours, I guess. So little content it doesn't feel worth my time. (Most of my hours were spent on Day1 hardmode, anyway)
I played this game after being recommended it by a friend. I found it absolutely amazing! The way the highways match up to the song is brilliant.
