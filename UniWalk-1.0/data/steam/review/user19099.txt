Good game, some is like the old Doom and that part of the game play is great.. After you move from the station you end up in a never ending deathmatch level after level in the demon world. I wish they could have stayed on the station and moved around to figuring out how to move to one part then the next part.  And make the main game CO_OP full stop.
