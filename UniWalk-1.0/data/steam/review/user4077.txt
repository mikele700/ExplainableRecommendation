This game is okay. Pretty good cars tho. Something like a 7... or 8 outta 10? Yeah that's good. So yeah, it looks alright too, got nice graphics and flames and stuff. Physics are pretty accurate too. Player base need some work tho, might be patch in future.all in all, its okay.
A great game if you have some friends to have laughs with, if you love platformers then this game is for you!
Can last a good few ours in Single Player, but if you grab a friend and enter Multiplayer mode this game will make for a co-operative and stratigicly fun game. Orcs Must Die! 2 is a great game that increasingly puts pressure on your stratergies and will make you rethink the way you play every level. Certanly worth the money.
