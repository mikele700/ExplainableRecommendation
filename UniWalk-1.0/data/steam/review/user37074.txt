i really love the Anime and i recommend u play it before the lastest one Ninja Storm 4... hehei still play for the online battles  & the feels for not having the newer game.
IF you like LOL check it in 3rd Person lel
..Hey that actually prety good..:D
Real Boss once you get the hang of it.
Really fun if u play on Master but gets boring once u reach at least lvl 50 or higher tbh.
