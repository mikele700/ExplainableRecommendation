This game is worth a lot more than $20. For a game that is only in Alpha it is pretty much perfection. When you start off the game is freakin terrible. You will more than likely die more than once to a bear, zombie, wolf or even another player looking to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But within about an hour of learning slowly, you learn how to suvive, how to harvest wood and stone, how to craft a weopon to kill for food (the starting stone is hard to kill with) and eventually build an effective house with a strong defence. This game is full on multiplayer and playing with freinds is a much better way of playing it, as you can help each other create a small town and guard it. Playing solo is not as nearly as good, simply because people will come in parties who have better gear then you and will kill you and take everything you have just worked so hard for. It is a LOT harder to take down a party with M4's then a lone wolf with a revolver.Only two downsides to this game are, as I have already mentioned, starting sucks a lot (most games do, but this game is unforgiving without a party), and the second is the occasional glitch of an ai (wolves and bears mainly) attacking through walls (mainly cpu buildings). However considering that the game is still in Alpha and a lot of work will be done on this amasing game, I dont really think that it will discourage most people to play this amazingly well made game.Thank you Facepunch studioes, for developing this amazing game.
If you enjoy punching kittens and being an evil ♥♥♥♥ that thrives off of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ then this is the game for you, 90% of the user base will make you want to kill yourself and you'll often be asking yourself why you're sitting here at 3am with no pants playing a giant load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for no reason, it's addictive - but so is cocaine and I would rather be a banged up coke ♥♥♥♥♥ about to get stabbed in the face several times then ever play this game.
