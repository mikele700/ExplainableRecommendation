I first played this game over 15 years ago and i still find it as challenging an engaging as I did all those years ago. This game really has stood the test of time; a true testament to the brilliance of the game developers.  If you're into sneaky strategy and tactics and have a bit of patience, this game is certainly for you. Highly recommend =)
Sniper Elite 3 is my first and only venture into the Sniper Elite series...and i absolutely loved it!! The graphics are simply fantastic. There are some cool downloadables as well. I myself purchased some of the weapons packs to add a few more options to my armoury. In a nutshell, if you are a fan of World War 2 themed games or have in an interest in this particular episode of world history, you will love this game! A++++
