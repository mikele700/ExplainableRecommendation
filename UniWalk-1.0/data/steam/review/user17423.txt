Had this for a while and haven-'t reviewed it.Basicly: It-'s about a boy named -Clink- (in reference to Link) who tries to beat this monster guy from taking over his world. He goes through changes of evolutions of games as he goes on such as 3D, Color, Sound and etc.Pros:-Very creative Idea-Makes alot of references to modern RPG-'s-Nice functioning all around-Nice bosses and fair difficulty (except for maybe the final boss, which can be extremely confusing if you don-'t know what you-'re doing)Cons:-Final battle has a different system than his 1st form, making all the things you readied for him useless and a waste of your time. (such as potions)-I personally found the first parts of the game frusterating, I don-'t know if it was dying in one hit, the hitboxes or whatever.-The dungeons and places with alot of enemies can get stale and boring very quickly. Dying in them just makes it frusterating to the point where you just don-'t want to play anymore.-Just a personal opinion, but I found some of the events in the game to be useless in the storyline.Some I probably missed, but there is much more pros than cons.Personal Rating: 7.8/10
A -wise- kid once said this game was garbage compared to CoD, that kid was a 5 year old.
The most laggiest game I have ever played.It's cool but it lags WAY too much (And my computer still has alot of memory in it.). I don't reccomend. If your computer can handle everything and like FPS's then it might be okay, otherwise no.EDIT:Holy ♥♥♥♥ you need to pay for tons of stuff in this game.
