Please beware, I attempted to read the Russian but the tutorial went way too slow for the amount of text it had so I was attempting to skip it the entire time and didn't get to read everything.I very much enjoyed this game with it's fun, smooth, simple gameplay and its futuristic, warship theme. It didn't really have any lore but that doesn't matter considering it's free. The game is so simple that you don't even need the ability to read in order to figure out what's going on so even if you were my neglected goldfish, you should still be able to play. I found this game intersting considering that it's about the most creative thing you will find in the last two-three years. If you take a look at the amount of re-used jokes in Family Guy or the shooter genre, you would probably agree.Pros:It's freeThe tutorial shows gameplay while teaching you (which is cool I guess?)It's simpleIt's funIt's excitingIt's like a MOBA but funIt has few micro-transactions (I didn't really notice any but I'm pretty sure there are some)It has better animations than the latest Scooby-Doo series.The community isn't toxic (I suggest you become good before it does)Cons:THE TUTORIAL IS SO ♥♥♥♥ING LONG! THERE IS LIKE TWO PARAGRAPHS WORTH OF INFORMATION IN IT! (and no skip button :P)They didn't explain when the English version is gonna release (not that I'm complaining but it is bad for others)There is a framerate drop.It has a tendency to go into a process of crashing.The main menu may actually never load or show you how to begin to play as there are no buttons or loading signs...If I were you I would begin to play now before everyone else begins too however I'm not you and actually have a life away from the computer screen (the one by the TV where that rusty playstationboy 64 is kept). If you can't speak Russian, I suggest you just watch the gameplay and flashing arrows pointing at cool looking things during the tutorial as you might or might not learn something. If you told me you had a life away from anything electronic related, I would think you were lying and then tell you to wait for the English version but who knows how long that'll take?
Even with the best computer in the world, it'll still go at 20FPS!They haven't released an update for a very long time and still haven't fixed any of the glitches but they promise us something for Dota 2 so I guess that's good enough (it's an abandoned project and they expect it to be fine)! They made it way more complicated than it has too be, you can't use CS:Source textures unless you go into the files of the programme and to spawn something simple, it takes ten minutes! 10/10, would waste hours again!
(if you cant be bothered reading this then just scroll down for the rating and reasons on why it's good and bad)It's a really good game considering its price however it does take a week to get used to the controls and how some of the gamemodes work in it but they don't have a tutorial... It's annoying how you do need CS: Source to view a lot of maps and items that most servers use but you can get those textures for free off of websites which is legal (just in case you think it isn't) or you can do it through a tiny bit more legitament way by buying it with Garry's Mod or standalone but I highly recommend buying it in a bundle as it does lower the price by quite a bit. If you can't be bothered installing all the textures by downloading them online then buying it would be better for you as all you need to do is download CS: Source and just go back onto Garry's Mod but if your like me and your going to barely play CS: Source then just buy it on a sale or download the textures (to be honest I did both because I downloaded the textures but about a month later the game was about $2 so I bought it anyway).7/10 for...Negatives:- Making it incredibly dificult to download the textures.- Forcing you to have them in the first place- Making CS:source way too overpriced considering it's not even that good compared to CS: GO which is newer and cheaper- No tutorials- Overly complicated tools considering thier is no tutorialPositives:- Lowering the price to $1 on sales- Making the original price $10 (considering its a online only game)- In-built workshop compatibility- So many different gamemodes- Some gamemodes are mixed in with others on some servers to create the ultimate game (sort of like Sandbox where you can do what you want and build with PVP where you can still do what you want but no flying through walls, building bases, killing others and still building amazing contraptions).In summary Garry's Mod is a great casual game that you can play everyday if you want but it isnt hardcore so it's meant to be more of a entertaining, funny game which is a lot better to play with friends and if you don't have friends then use a mic while playing on servers as it will be just as much entertaining (you don't have to have a mic either you can also type in chat).
