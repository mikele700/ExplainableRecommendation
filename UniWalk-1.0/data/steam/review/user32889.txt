Everything I ever wanted out of a space sim.
This game has matured beautifully, if you are an RTS fan then this game is worth getting for sure. The interface is the best I have ever seen in any RTS
I've been very suprised with this game, even in its curent form it's a whole lot of fun. Can't wait for them to finish and polish everything off
