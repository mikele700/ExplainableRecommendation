This game is scary, ambiguos, intense and mysterious, and all packed into the creepiest thing since the actual Chuckee Cheese. With a great blend of atmosphere, game mechanics and jumpscares that actually make some sense (by today's standards). This game isn't for everyone but if you want to relieve that unbearable constipation then step right to the original that started a quadrilogy... Five Night at Freddy's.
