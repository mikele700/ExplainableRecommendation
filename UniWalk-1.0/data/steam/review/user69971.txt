That moment when Factorio has better reviews than Tom Clancys The Division
gd game, very addictive, cant wait for updates
EXTREMELY detailed engine building and tuning options, very simple to use.. great fun exspecially when you can fine tune your self a monster engine!!Poor graphics and very buggy (ITS EARLY ACCESS WHO CARES)
A update with some new vehicles and maps would be nice
