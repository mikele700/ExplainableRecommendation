This game in the first 30 minutes of playing was amazing. I only got a short time to play it due to IRL issues but this was still probably one of the best TPS shooters i've played in a very very long time. Reason being all classes are balanced from the word GO! in TDM I didn't die too often enough for me to leave and not play it for another 2 hours but I was really enjoying it at the time. The downside of the game was the sword. It's OP from the begining as soon as you get the 3rd upgrade if I was the maker or the main editor of this game I would either A. Remove the swords, B Do a HUGE nerf for them or C just allow some servers to have them and others not. In replacement for what? I don't know but overal I think this game gives a pure TPS experience overal thank you for releasing this and I look forward to playing it more in the future.
