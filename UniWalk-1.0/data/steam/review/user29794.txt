tried playing this back when it was first picked up for an english version and could never get it to work(had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer and little knowledge on how to get things to work) after playing for a while its a good game wish i had gotten it when i was younger because i would of enjoyed it more then,but still a fun little side scroller brawler
by the time i had gotten this game i had already seen multipul playthroughs of the game. I thought i knew what i was getting myself into.... I was wrongand now i have a very expensive carpet cleaning bill just to get all the excrement out of my floors. 10/10
in this game you play as a leper with super stregth  with the ability to looks at bundles of twigs to forget how disfiigured and disgusting you actually look..untill you die needs more realism like falling off arms and legs like a real leper victim you should buy this game to help raise awareness on how hard it is to be a Leper  you can also crush boxes and destroy walls with your sword so thats pretty boss 
most true to life party simulator that iv ever played  
hours of emotional therapy in this game a really cathartic experience
the lies told in this game will haunt me till the day i shuffle out of this mortal coil
i spent hours making the closest to the real thing look alikes of all my friendsonly to watch them die in minutes. now i dont have to be passve aggressive to my friends because i can just get them killed by doing stupid  ...like running one tile from an enemy and pulling the pin on a grenade if you have issues with people i suggest playing this game.   also its a really good game or whatever
