Incredibly fun, in a category of its own.
Simply an amazing game :)
A sci-fi Terraria with many innovative and unique features. Though still in an early stage, the game is incredibly fun and complex in a way that challenges the player without pushing them away. We can only imagine just how amazing the final product will be.
