all i can say is i played this for quite sometime enjoyed it but i switched to other mmo games Pro-Simple to understand-Items are easy like as in you can get good items -cool characters Cons-sometimes the mobs can b hard but can get through it-you need friends to play with -takes a bit long to level etc
2013 Dota 2 Good players Good Game less blaming games end usually quick about 40mins tops2014 Dota 2 Still good players but is becoming less still less blaming game time incresed 1hour long2015 Dota 2 has become very viral and infected with more blaming / many players that gives up easy2015 Dota 2 Reborn Good somehow this improved the whole dota custom games are boss but in normal match idk yet. Overall: 1st timers playing dota learn 2 play before going 2 real matches to avoid much blames and flaming even report For casual players just coz ur team sucks just get on with it and play dont b a ♥♥♥ and feed the gameHardcore players no comment....Troll players I sometimes Like and Dislike... depends on situation
Note: This game crashes at some points of the game but not always so buy at your own riskMugen souls is a good jrpg game ill rate it 7/10 the game is unfortunately quite short unlesss you try to aim all the achievements or take your time playing the game exploring fighting and not use a guide for the ship battles.The only negative thing i can say about this game is that it crashes at some point not sure if its me since my gpu isnt so top notch i run this game 15fps on battles and 30fps on event scene and maybe 1 other negative is the grind itself to earn gold and points. so if you are a jrpg or lived with it i think you will enjoy this game
Really a shame that i cant run warframe on steam due to its not working very well like it wont even open so i had to go download the non steam one but overall i like it already spent 25$ lol lets just hope this will last forever
FEAR 1 is the most best out of all series should def get it its old but enjoyable not many thriller horror shooting games out there but id say this is one of the best the other series FEAR 2/3 is less scarier shorter gameplay 2
Overall rate for me+Great PVE and PVP design i dont think ill ever get tired of killing humans or zombies and climbing+The combination of AC dead island etc has made this game interesting + the day and night setting makes the game more intense in its own way +With coop you can heal and revive thats like so ideal -2 many cliche scenes -Character not even creative as in if u play coop they all look the same-Story line same old as always fetch grab save getting a bit tired of it-lame ending cant they make this better? (like witchers ending was so great i was satisfied the whole game)Overall game is 7/10 solo 9/10 for coop needs more improvement for character/ story ending
This mod got some buggs but nothing major get this if u want to play with other players or friends :)
Game can be fun but boring sometimes soo i suggest dont play it continously. since the offical release leveling has become more hard quest gives less exp at certain level like only 2% so if you are the type that can handle grinding for days this game is good for you
only 2 thing to say its great the classes are ♥♥♥♥ as hard to level if you reach lvl 3 or so
Only good if youre into RPG and grinding to level up your character or mastering the craft
