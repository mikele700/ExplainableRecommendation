I was really looking forward to getting this game but every time it loads a game i get a notification saying my graphics card stopped working wtf.Not recommended if you have a lower end graphics card.
When it first came out i really enjoyed it, but thats before it went pay2win. Now you have to buy infinite to even unlock new equipment. fuqen piece o' s.hit
wish it had more chapters
its a great game i just wish it didnt crash all the time
Its alright i suppose, its good if you want to have a little fun every now and then but it gets anoying and boring if you play it for long periods of time.
it sucks
