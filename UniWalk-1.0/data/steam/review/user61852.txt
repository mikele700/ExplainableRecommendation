Even in early access this game is amazing, the immersive post apocalyptic tone, survival aspects and player interaction is great. Well, the player interaction can get a bit messy, when the occasional asshat makes you eat bleach, but when you're saved by zombies by a stranger or given some food it's all worth it.
Tons of fun, this is one of the best co-op games I have ever played. Nice steampunk art-style, enjoyable gameplay. One bad thing is that all the servers are american/europian etc, so us Oceanic players get pretty bad ping.Nevertheless, an awesome game.
Awesome game alot of fun. Well worth the $0.00
