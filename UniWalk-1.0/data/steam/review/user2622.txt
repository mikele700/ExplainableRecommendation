Team Fortress 2 is One of my Favorite Steam Games plus  like how you can get alot of Infinite weapons and that most of the Weapons can be Sometimes Overpowered. I like the Really Cool Cosmedics that you can get in the Game and that you can Craft Weapons and Trade from your Inventory too.My only Downside is that there Hackers and Cheaters in there which they can Actually Hack in Some Valve Servers but other than that this Game is really Extreme, Epic, Awesome, and Cool. Oh and P.S. I like the Man vs. Machine Mann Co. Battles. That is all I have to Say for now but I have a lot more that I have to share about this Game. This is my own opinion on TF2 and do the best that you can do with this Game Valve
I like the Weapons and Guns For this Game, but I don't Get Why the Villans Have to Look like that lke Human Face and then robot Body
