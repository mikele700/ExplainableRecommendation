Why this game was not a MASSIVE hit, I dont know. I just LOVED it! GREAT ARPG!!!!!
Why all the grief? This is the best $15.00 i have spent in a LONG time. I have played this game non stop pretty much since its release. 230 + hours and still playing! I have great time with freinds, have hardley found any bugs, and just all round had an excellent time. I cannot see what people are complaining about, I have gotten SO much value from this game. When i play alone i find it intense and genuinely scary, or when with freinds on highly populated serves, its fast and  exciting and rewarding!
You'll Be Emo'd by the end of it!
