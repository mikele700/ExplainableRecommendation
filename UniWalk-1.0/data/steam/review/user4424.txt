Alright, i'll be completely honest here.i had a lot of faith in this game when i bought it; the constant updates every day or so, the community etc. until about a month or two after, when updates basically halted to once every three weeks, and with every update that brought content or fixes, another bug would arise. this game is great in it's concept however leaving a game that has it's whole back-story/influence to a russian guy is like letting an indian direct a movie about the american civil war, it makes no sense whatsoever. this game had so much potential for growth however it looks to be just a cash-grab for the dev as he seems to be focused on making another game, and it looks to be that he is pretty much porting stuff from that game and putting it in DSJ.honestly, buy it if you've got the dosh to spare, but don't expect much.
when you're bearing down on a 120 degree angle towards the enemy squadron of spitfires in your Focke-Wulf 190 A-5 and music is blaring in your ears, that one moment of euphoria calms you down as you crash ever so peacefully due to your actions and stupidity.
