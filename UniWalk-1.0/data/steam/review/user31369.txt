Well if you looking for a game with terrible gameplay, cliche story and the most uninteresting characters ever created.......THEN YOUR IN THE WRONG PLACE. This game is a masterpeice and deserves all the praise its been getting. The gameplay is extremely unique since it mixes jrpg elements with bullet hell, (this was a brilliant idea). ALL the characters are extremely interesting, i dont think i came across one enemy that i thought was boring this can also be said for the MUSIC. The music in this game, OMG where do i start, the music is AMAZING and clearly has had a lot of time put into creating the perfect tune for each encounter. Oh by the way the game is extremely funny and is self realised, from every little joke made at almost averything you interact with. Undertale surprisingly has a really in depth morality system that will remember EVERYTHING you did in your playthrough. This effects greatly how the story will play out and even goes on to shape how your next run will go.Now heres where the game hooks you the most.THE FEELSI dont think ive ever been as emotionaly scared. Undertale does a Brilliant job at making you feel like what your doing matters. From showing mercy and making friends with EVERYONE to being a completely psychopathic murderer. oh and if you thought that you can just reset the game and try again if you, say accidentally kill someone, well your going to have a bit of a surprise when you run into them again (thats all i'm goint to say).And yes this game has great replay value since there are multiple endings (That are actually vastly different from each other). So overall this game is a MUST BUY. trust me you wont regret it.
