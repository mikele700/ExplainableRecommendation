I would probably rate this game 10/10. I've only had the game for a couple of days now and i've got loads of fun out of it. The game is really challenging, has tons of different game modes and lots of achievements. The more exhilerating the game becomes the more you get into it...BUT. WARNING: HIGHLY ADDICTIVE. Anyway really awesome game, my favourite indie game atm! I don't usually do reviews but this game deserved one! And remember......Take your time....and focus!!!
