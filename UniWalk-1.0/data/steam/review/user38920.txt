it was a good time killer. thats about it - and theres the problem. i think it would be much better if it were more than just a game to kill time. i thinkk it would have been better if there was more achievements in-game, or maybe even some upgrades on the base itself. like having different styles per upgrades on the buildings or maybe even some action in game. also the AI SUCKS SO BAD. theyre all busy standing doing nothing while the robots do the bulk of the work. this probably needed more than 6 months before releasing as it felt like a very incomplete game. i like where this is going though so please improve the game to make it worth my money.
one of the bests. i would give it a perfect 5/7!
