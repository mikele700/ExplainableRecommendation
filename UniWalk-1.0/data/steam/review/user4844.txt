A gr8 game with heaps of shooting and more shooting and tactics and headshots and twelvies and more shooting and competitive and skins and overpriced knifes and dak daks and more so get the game bro.Let's just hope you don't get stuck in Silver Cancer if you were to play Comp.
Get the damn game.It's amazing.
I have played 2.6 hours roughly and about 2.55 of those hours were spent in the menu screen getting cards to make money. Guess what my rating would be.
