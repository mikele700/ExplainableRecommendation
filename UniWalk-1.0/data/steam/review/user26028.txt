This game and this development team are a shining example of what an early access game should be like. Even in it's current alpha state it is absolutely amazing in terms of detail, realism and gameplay. The updates that come are huge and it's obvious that this team care about their players.If you can put up with a potty-mouthed Squadie who uses the c**t word to issue orders then this game is for you,I'm 110% satisifed with Squad. Buy it, like now you c**ts...
