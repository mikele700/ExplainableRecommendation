Good game the way it is, is just amazing the field of view makes you feel excited like your playing and actually fun game campaign was short but i've completed all side mission and still have fun just mucking around.
This game is in Alpha game but is still a Great Game to play with friends hopefully most of my friends would get this game but if you haven-'t heard of it Look up on websites called -Youtube- and good channels that play Dayz Standalone like -Frankie plays Dayz Standalone, or Rhinocrunch- that play this game and see if your interested. I also play with one of my Friends on Dayz Standalone cause It-'s enjoy able to play by the way i have over 100 friends and there-'s not many people with dayz that i see play and this game is only alpha it-'s only just started to get better.
Good game, If your thinking about getting this game or have it. Please dont get hacks it will ruin your fun and experience i know a few friends that had hacked and now bored of the game I haven't hacked and the amount of hours i've played its still a great game these new updates are making it a lot better and DLC's i've got makes it better and more fun, Enjoy.

Would like this game but if your willing to take time and download so much and just waste time when you can get something else done instead good game but the downloading is just not worth it sorry thumbs down.
I got addicted at first but then all these hackers keep joining my games making it hard for me to do stuff and as you'd think you'd wanna get money off them but it ruins the game for you because in the end your have everything but still good game First person shooters where always my favourate soo GTA is a game I'll play for the fun of it, not for taking it serious like some people like your in a group of people they want you to wear this stuff but it either cost to much or its terrible looking for your character but good game love it not a GTA person. xD
Really fun game highly addictive new to it but I'm interested in Wasteland really cool realistic Arma 3 and how the game feels and its all whats around you and its just amazing.
