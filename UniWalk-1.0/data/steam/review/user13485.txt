So, i told a friend about Portal Stories: Mel, and she decided to get both Portals plus this. She has played maybe 10 mins on each apart from portal 2 of which she is going through the co-op with me, and she says she doesn-'t enjoy the portal game series... This is a direct Quote: 'I-'m stuck on portal 1, i-'m playing portal 2 with you and portal 3 is all about going down a stupid giant lift-So 11/10 to Portal Stories: Mel for not only really making me think about the tests, but also for being -Portal 3-......
Story line had me on the edge of my seat, rather enjoyed the mechanics of the game. Love the steampunk style of the game. Sad that i lost the dragon form, but it is insanely overpowered. Can't really think of any downsides yet. Still need to go through the Onslaught mode and the hard diff of the story, but otherwise, a hell of a good game. A 10/10 for me
