(Sighs) Ok this not going to be the best review i have done so far but here goes nothing.Infestion or WarZ is a MMO Zombie survival game that takes place in a few places and countrys around the world. When you first start a game you choose your character. You only start of with a Ex-Milltary soldire and a Hunter. 2 CLASSES! when you start. The Game Looks Pathetic and it runs really bad only if you have a really bad PC). Combat is Sluggish when attacking zombies.Their is a leveling up System Thats Ok But not the best Compare to GTAV Or Battlefeild's Leveling up System. Loot is SO easy to find which is Ok. I wished the develpers(Sorry if i spelled that incorect) Made more maps and upgraded the graphics a little more. I think Infestaion is a RipOff of DayZMy Final Score 2/10
Epic,awesome, and enjoyable
IT'S SO MUCH FUN theirs nothing else i could say
Hundreds of Hours Of fun,modding, and so on
