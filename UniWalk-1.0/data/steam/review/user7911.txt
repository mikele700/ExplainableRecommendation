this game is a game that you can play if your frustated or between games (which i always do) this game is just.....FUN!!!! it does frustate you but at the same time you get so much joy when you beat your time....but then 2 seconds later BOOM! Id give this game 9/10
this game does have a lot of problems like unbalanced guns and vehicles, but it is still a great game to play with friends, it shows a lot of potential but at the moment the devs arent doing much to balance anything or fix bugs. the game will take some grinding to get the guns you want or you can just pay2win (the prices are wayyyyy too much). altogether this game feels like a more basic battlefield mixed in with some medal of honour. i would play this game but get prepared for heavy grinding and unfair games at times.9/10
