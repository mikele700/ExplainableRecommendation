Bought during Christmas Sale for the most expensive price of $4.00. Ruined 3 hours of my lifetime today. Next day probably 100 hours. 10.1/10 Absolutely the most intense game i ever played as well as addicting. Whenever it is on sale, snag it. Trust me, it'll ruin your life forever.
Addictive game! Gameplay is great! Awesome graphics!BUT, its NEEDS more fun! Game is OK overall but you can GET bored of it.If you previously have an account for F2P Hawken (Non-Steam) then do not buy this. Check you email for STEAM KEY
I gotta say i got heavily misleaded by the negative reviews. I almost avoided buying this game even whens it 6 bucks.. I would never regret buying this game for the world. Sure, I have almost 2 hours into the game but just 1 match of PA and you can fully experience the mayhem of Annihilation. Ironically, i found myself screaming to my units to rush towards the enemy commander's base while my commander tries to avoid the crossfire in my base at 15% HP (YOLO HARDCORE). Result? I lost. I'm itching to play more of PA very soon possibly may end up with my top games. Snag it guys. Great game, great funa and its on sale so better purchase it. P.S Haters gotta hate
What is this game... oh right my life
Only one hour in and it's okay. Russians but alright
Got an achievement, The dude on the toilet! Best game eva 10/10
