On this review I am going to point out a few tips on adding/removing some items and things in the gameI request you add a Double-Barrel Shotgun, because who doesn't love the redneck's favourite weapon?A 9mm pistol would be awesome, 9mm's are common and 1 should be added to the game. Possible suggestions: Glock 18 (it is common with the Police Force, this makes it acceptable), Sig Sauer P226. I am not requesting you put any fully-automatic AK47's and M4A1's, or a powerful Barret M82A1. Because I believe they would be way too overpowered. But anyway that is your call, you make the decisions, I'm just here to make suggestions and possibilities.Wouldn't Mom's Chunk Tuna in Water unhydrate us a little more than it does at the moment?PS. Loving the new crosshair
REALLY GOOD GAME... ESPECIALLY TTT :D (Trouble in Terrorist Town)
PRETTY GOOD :D
