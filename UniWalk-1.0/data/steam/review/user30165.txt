Mirror-'s edge is a game of beauty. It manages to pack excitment, a spectacular soundtrack and amazing graphics into such a simple idea. It is an amazing game and even though I have only played a small section of it, This game just blew me away. It-'s quick paced and doesn-'t slow down, it doesn-'t drag on. Bam Bam Bam. Ain-'t no stoping it! The sound is crisp, clear and absolutley beautiful. The artwork is original and not like all those generic titles we all seem to love. 100% reccommened it. If you want to be blown away by all of its amazing -edges- (pun intended). Don-'t stop thinking about it, buy it!
