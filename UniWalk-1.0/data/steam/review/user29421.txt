Is a good game overall and you can spend hours just tweaking your ships and such. Rail and Plasma are bit OP but devs are trying to balance gameplay with regualr updates. It has good graphics and a good community even though you might do ♥♥♥♥ at earlier levels. Was real skeptical and thought it would be P2W but isnt even though it has a similar system to de-dust where if u get a block destroyed you have to pay to build it again. However you get more than enough money at the end of the round to rebuild ur ship and buy new parts.Dont listen to anyone else. i made a ♥♥♥♥, a tank and an airship that worked.
I accidentally collateralled a guy through a zombie and his friend pushed me off the building into the zombie horde below. I just survived and started running away before a child zombie pushed me into a trash can. I fell through the map and my computer blue screened. 10/10
have no idea how good the game is cos nobody ♥♥♥♥ing plays it oce
