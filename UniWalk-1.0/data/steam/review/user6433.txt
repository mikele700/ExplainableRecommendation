This game is ♥♥♥♥It tells you it is an RPG but makes you play as some disgusting freak that sounds like batmanThe voice acting sounds like something out of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sitcomVery few dialouge optionsBoring ♥♥♥ quests involving finding or killing somethingDated and crappy movement controlsTries to be edgy by spitting out the word -F***- every 5 minutesBuggy as hell horse♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ storyStupid characters I dont care aboutPS1 era graphicsof course Im joking this game is amazing please buy it and everything I listed down was nothing but bait well...besides the roach part
I type in my name.....mister handy says my name.....reflect on all my past mistakes......take a second to realize how good this game is......then my mind explodes.........111/111 would explode mind again                     fallout 4 is better than mgs 5 and the witcher 3 combined                                                                                                             problem ?
DeadSpace_exe has stopped workingwindows 10 ples....[Update] I finally managed to boot this baby up, I-'m a big Dead Space fan and I really recommend playing this seeing as it is one of the best horror games to date P.S if you are wondering how I fixed this problem I simply added a settings.txt file and then opened -testapp- from within the main Dead Space directory, this some how booted it up, I hope this helps :)
