Well Rust is quite a good game besides the fact it's in early access. The guns are not extremely over powered because of their kick is very high as it would be in real life but you would still loose hand rock vs pistol. I like how The developers are taking a new lead to this game and have been doing alot of updates and changes lately but one thing that I haven't seen in the devblog is a way on how to make the player base more friendly. This is a big deal with gameplay in Rust because it is extremely hard to find someone who doesn't shoot you on sight ( Even If your a new spawn with no gear sometimes.) This is getting to a ridiculous point it has turned a survival game to an all out free for all where people shoot on sight. now a days the only way I find someone who doesn't shoot on sight is when I have a better weapon than them and I tell them to run off and maybe give them food. but sometimes the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ urge is to strong in some people and they go for the kill anyways. The only benefit from this player base is killing a bandit who killed you as a new spawn and absolutly burn their soul in embarrasment. Maybe the devs can't fix this but we can I and my friends have made a pledge not to shoot on sight unless we know that person is hostile. can you guys please band together on this one for me it would make the gameplay alot better. At Rust's Current state I give it a 7/10 The player base needs alot of work!
