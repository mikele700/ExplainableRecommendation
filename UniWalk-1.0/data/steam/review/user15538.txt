I love this game! I love those big construction machines but the only problems i have are a. finding servers with the workshop mods installed but that is an easy fix with the discussion page andb. the game gets slightly boring after a while.
good game, good graphics but it needs some fixes here and there but overall i recoomend this game 8/10
