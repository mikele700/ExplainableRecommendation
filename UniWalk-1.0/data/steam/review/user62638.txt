Great game, I've already played almost 20 hours on this game and yet I havn't explored nearly all you can do yet. PROS/CONSPROS: -Almost endless possiblities to design and creativity-Great source of items-Great landscapes (choosing from a generated world or a flat world)CONS: -Due to early stages, the game, for me, can do a lot more, so I'm hoping it'll become more interesting WHAT THIS GAME COULD INCLUDE IN THE FUTURE: -Changes in weather, i.e Day/night, Clear/cloudy-Ladders -No clip mode if there isn't already one (for creative only) -Water (for possible boat/submarine creations) -More of a variety of size in the items (excluding building blocks since they already have this feature)Over all, very good game, I can't wait for further changes. 9/10 for me, and when the game is complete, a definate 10/10!
