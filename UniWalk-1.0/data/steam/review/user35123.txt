Oldschool? YepHardcore? YepHATS!?! HELL YEAAAAAXXXXEEEEEE
Assetto Corsa is a perfect example of how far technology has come recently. I may be using a low end wheel (Logitech Driving Force Pro) although this game still makes it feel like real life! Currently as I am typing this, AI is not available for the game, although it is currently being worked on. Although even with an opponent to race against, it is surprisingly fun and makes you want to keep on playing.
