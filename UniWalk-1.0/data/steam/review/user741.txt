So far so good, the default characters supplied are not underpowered and so far your success depends on your skill not what character you are using or your enemies are using
The core mechanics of the game are perfect apart from slight (I dont even think you could call them bugs) issues such as deleting braces which can be a little difficult but nothing game breaking. As of right now the only changes/updates that I feel need to happen are more maps, make the settings more detailed and NOTHING ELSE, THE GAME WORKS, PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE CORE, IT IS PERFECTTHANK YOU
