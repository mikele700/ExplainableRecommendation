Spintired is a decent game that performs well in most areas but slightly lacks in others. A few problems I see with it are that the missions and objectives do get a bit repetitive and can take a very long while to complete. Also in my opinion with the graphics turned all the way up the game still lacked in image quality. Apart from those things this is a good game and wpuld recommend this to any serious gamer.
Its a great little game to play and it helps you burn time. its like TF2 just less stressing. recommended to all. overall 8 out of 10
tf2 is a full map. item finding mision that is fun to play and craft on. i recomend it
