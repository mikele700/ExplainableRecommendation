Its a Great Game, Yeah it Just Released not even 4 hours ago, not the best game Optimization right now and many bugs and crashes, but lets just hope they fix this right?
This game is amazing Reminds me of Rust Legacy, Mostly all the People ive met All Friendly Pretty Chill, so +rep to the Community, Amzing FPS on Highest Setting, Would Recommend to anyone!
