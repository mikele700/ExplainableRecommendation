Amazing game but i have encounted some serious problems, it ran fine for 2 hours, past that mark it crashed and now every time i try to start a new game it goes to the loading screen and then freezes, you can hear the sound of the character spawning into the water and when you click or press a button it comes up with -Subnautica .exe not responding- I-'ll re-installed the game and i am still having the same problem
