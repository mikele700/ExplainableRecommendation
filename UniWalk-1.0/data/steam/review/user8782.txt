When you grew up with a game that you cherish so much when you were younger. Revisiting it only makes you feel a strange nostalgic sadness. Truly a masterpiece.
Pros:Pretty fun with friendsPulling off difficult heists with a team gives a great feeling of satisfactionVersatile and diverse customizable tech tree that suits you're playing styleSolid Combat MechanicTons of masks that you can customize to your own personal tasteCons:Buggy as ♥♥♥♥Constant Failed to join gamesToxic CommunityNetcoding is non existantGame Crashes at the most inopportune timesConstant Barrage of DLCs that could have been included as free contentSafes and Drills are completely uneccessaryUseless AI botsConclusion:Overkill spends more time shilling out DLCs and Microtransactions rather than fix up the horrible netcodes and bugs. If you want to get everything and all the DLCS, get them on a sale and highly reccomend Hoxhud to offer some form of ♥♥♥♥ing direction.Edit: Was the additional money and exp boosts neccessary? I am sure that the THOUSANDS of people who tell you this was a bad idea wasn't getting through, do we seriously need to DRILL some sense into your brains in this day and age? (Pun intended)
Go back to a simplier time where Microtransactions are non-existant and games are ACTUALLY games. Plants vs Zombies is a Tower Defense where you plant sentient plants against hordes of zombies. Despite the name, it's actually fun where you can plant a variety of flora, ranging from evil looking mushrooms that is the equivalent of a mini nuke to literal pea shooter plants all while being guarded by a literal wall-nut. Tons of fun content and it's also $5.
With the Multiplayer Servers down, single player seems like the only reason to get this game. Getting the DLCs seems kinda pointless (Unless you want to get the G2 Bruticus and G1 Optimus skins) seeing as how the Multiplayer Servers are down. Basically rendering HALF of the achievements null. PLayed War For Cybertron, while it lacks DLC and such, at least Multiplayer is available.
Does anyone even remember this game? Pepper ridge farms does
Extremely fun game, needs more Australian servers.
This game is another classic of my childhood. Something that is enjoyable to this day. The music is like the original Rome: Total War as the music changes to match the current situation. Such a game like this should be praised for it's gameplay despite it's old graphics.
