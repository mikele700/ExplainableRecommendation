What can be said about primal fears? well it is an updated version of dead hoard, there just isn't really much change with this game there are only one or two variations of specimens that have a different size and skin texture but are still the same well let's go through the list.Pro's-More Weapons!-Hub World(Camp)-An Arena-Moveable PropsCon's-Moveable Props...(they can get in your way)-Not enough enemy variation-Enemies absorb way to many shots.-Limited sprint 3 seconds(can't roll)useless since most enemies can catch up to you anyway.-Always night.-Cannot shop in peace(shop menu doesn't pause the game also cannot buy medkits)-Re-used enemy jumper(which was in dead horde)-Level design is dull and cliche'd.-One level can take from 15 to 30 minutes to finish depending on difficulty.-Melee weapon is useless in any situation and serves as a joke when you could be spriting away for 3 seconds.Overall i would say this is an avarage shooter, no real innovating ideas or any new concepts, just reused boring ideas, if you are interested in shooters and just want some mind numbing fun, buy it, if you are looking for something new and interesting, don't buy it.if you want something similer try nation red or zombie shooter which will prove more fun.
The Harvest....of your wallet.The game itself fails on the most basic levels to be appealing or fun, most of the levels are empty barren and dull, the story is not to interesting to follow i only played once and still couldn't give a crap to even try once more the game feels mostly the same even if it has a few selection of characters, it will always feel long dull and to boring to maintain any sense of enjoyment or adventure.Pro's3D-Rendered Enviroments.Few selection of characters.Con's- Long dull levels- Story is very vague and boring.- Hideous Enviroments- Boring Enemies- Poor Class Builds- Odd object placement???- Becomes way to easy and allows the player to hoard more medkits then he/she will ever need.- Obvious port.- Very little else to do while on a mission.-The game lies-The publisher lies-ƒuck this game , ƒuck this game , ƒuck this game , ƒuck this game , ƒuck this game , ƒuck this game , ƒuck this game.Overall this is boring dull and to long of a game, if you like having spikes shoved so hard up your black hole while eating a monkey's scrottum from space, then don't buy this game, even if you don't like refer to previous statement, don't buy this game.
GTA San Andreas is most defiently one of the best games Rockstar has produced,There is a full array of missions& mini games as well as unlockable gear by doing jobs through taxi cops fire brigade pimping stealing, there are stats like muscle and fat, as well as guns stats that allow you to become a more dangerous, there is a good range of selection in clothing and car customization and many easter eggs to find, so much to do and so much more fun to gain. i highly recommand this to anyone.
a fun game had a few minor issues and it's sad to see it go.sad mostly for the people who invested money into this.
Judge Dredd: Dredd vs. Death is a first person shooter based on the comic, you play as the judge himself sent out to uphold the law arrest and protect civilians.The game itself been humorous in many ways weather it would be a long joke with a good payoff references or puns, such as after arresting several culprits dredd says to himself-you fought the law and the law won- or -i love the smell of justice in the morning-the mechinics are in itself very interesting, if someone resist arrest and continues to shoot at you, you can shoot their gun yell at them to get on their hands and knees and arrest them or simply just kill them, however killing innocents or not upholding the law can result in a mission failure, the famous gun dredd uses comes with several modes such as armor  pircing, fire, heat seeking and ricochet, you can also carry a second weapon which can be a handgun shotgun or an assult rifle.the graphics however didn-'t age to well and the game itself will only run at 1280 x 720 resolution anything above that will force the game to crash,the story the humor will possibly keep you entertained if the gameplay and graphics don-'t.
DLC QuestThis game is fun and amusing, what happens when every in-game action you enjoy turns into a pay2play model? you get this game.This pixel styled sidescroller platformer game is so much fun to play through and ironically does have DLC which only adds more to the game, there are no bugs i have never come across nor any techinical issues of any kind,if you like pixel styled sidescroller platformers and you like collecting shiny coins buy this game it's worth it.Don't worry it's not to long or to short if it's to short and you enjoyed it consider getting the dlc.
