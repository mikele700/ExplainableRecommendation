If you have money, and have some time to spare, you should try this game out. Definitely worth it. Unless you hate puns and skeletons. Then maybe you shouldn't.Music was great, story was great, all 3 endings were beautiful in their own right. Do not be turned off just because of the hype surrounding it, just try it for yourself and see whether you like it or not. Or don't. I don't really care. Bye.
