This game is terrible. I gave it 3.5 hrs of my life and could do no more.Aside from massive plot holes (how can your phone blow up storm vents?) the whole game feels way overhyped. Combat is boring and discovering the map almost feel pointless.The graphics and city were good though, sometimes there were little things that impressed me about the gameplay. But overrall was not enough to keep my interest.Get GTA V, my recommendation.
