Naked men, radioactive bears and guns. Not a redneck acid trip; Rust. 10/10 would recommend.
This was the reason that I got steam in 2011, as a friend had wanted to gift this to me.I now have over 200 hours with the New Steam Version included, and after 8 years of this game being out, it is still amazing.The mod support has extended the life of this game so much, even without the ability for Steam Workshop, which CoH 2 has. The mods available are varied enough to give everyone something they like, with different maps or game modes included in most of the large total conversion mods such as Blitzkrieg or Eastern Front.The base game itself is also extremely fun and very user friendly; it doesn't take long to get the hang of the game, and you can use the very enjoyable campaign as a running tutorial before getting into the multiplayer, which is still populated by the die hard fans.The expansions are also well worth the price of admission if you're a fan of the game, especially now that they are at such low prices, having been out for quite a while.This is one of the best strategy games I have ever played, and one of the best ever made, RTS or otherwise, and it's well worth buying.
PC elitists rejoice. It's an Elder Scrolls game. Nude mods fall from the heavens and blanket the Earth with beautiful imagery.Console commands! 1000 whees of cheese? Done. Attack them with your modded lightsabers? PC gamers plz. Child's play.I used to be an adventurer like Dovahkiin then I became a PC ♥♥♥ and bought this game.10/10. Graffics.
First played it on PS2, loved it, still a great game. Hard to get frustrated at unless you absolutely suck so a fun timewaster, which is what a game should be. Fun campaign, Galactic COnquest is a fun one too, and multiplayer as well, so loads of time to be played, well worth the small amount it costs.
