Sometimes you get lucky and have barley arny run ins with Catastrophic events and somtimes you will be 20 min into the game and BAM!!!!! MECH things shooting up the colony and ♥♥♥♥. There goes my whole colony.10/10 cookies. Love it and hate it. Can't go wrong
Great game. Competitive is the only way to really play and enjoy this game. But hey, thats just my opinion. Give it a try
