Cute cardboard on the wall with cute faces, This game is Humiliating until you descend further down into Spooky's Mansion then it gets scary.11.1/10 This game is spooky :P
This game is good for a F2P game, Why? Everything, It's a Zombie Survival game you can either do objectives or survive rounds, Stick together to survive longer, Help eachother out, Kill zombies, Get Infected, U ded amen :D1000/100 Lov It
I am a fan of Slender The Eight Pages and since the day it came out I got the game and my god the graphics are better, the forest looks beautiful (sexy) and there's a story to the game that I really like about games. Try this game yourself if you got balls to do it C:10/10 really good job
No more watching people kill zombies with gore now I can kill zombies with gore myself
Garry's mod, Best mod in this whole dumb world if I could vote out of 10 it would be 400,000/10.
