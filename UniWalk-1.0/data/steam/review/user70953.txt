This is a truly amazing game for Tolkien fans and RPG gamers alike. The game give you access to many starting areas including the beloved Shire and Bree-lands as seen in the movies and books. And give you the opportunity to play completely f2p by earning Turbine points in game to unlock other areas in Middle Earth. Additionally the Epic (main) questline is completely f2p and you can run through the entire game at no cost, completely worth it. If you want to see the beoved characters true to the books, experience some authentic tolkien lore, play classes with incredible skills and characteristics, become a member of the highest crafting guilds and test your skills in fellowships with people from all over the world I completely reccomend this game :D
