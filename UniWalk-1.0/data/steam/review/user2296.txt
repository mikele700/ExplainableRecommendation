La verdad es que este juego es muy entretenido para jugarlo con amigos, porque si andás solo, o te matan mucho, o te morís o te aburrís. En resumen: Está muy bueno y se los recomiendo.
You wanna a full-o-bugs game? This is perfect for you. An update was released: 560 bugs released, 1 fixed.10/10 would use flamethrower through a wall again.
What the hell are you reading this?! Go and download the DLC! (If you already own HL2)
