One of the best RTS games ever !Now on steam .Buy it !Play it !Love it !Just plain Awesome !
When I first bought this game I was not expecting much, but I soon found myself playing one of the most fun FPS games I have played in recent times. it had good graphics , good sound and a very good PC gamer Keyboard and Mouse setup options, and it was responsive and fast to play, it reminded me of a more action packed and feature rich Doom 3 with alien and standard weapon options , IN SUMMARY- great fun, one of the best shooters i have played recently, i rate it a solid 7.5 /10 for FPS games !
Good Single player game, multiplay is uncertain as the reason below explains. But be aware that this is a Microsoft Windows Live game and think of that fact before purchasing, but that has not and should not affect the enjoyment of a good action fps single player campaign, If bought for 5 US dollars on sale, what have you got to lose?  It is well worth a look for good if to pc gamers is a bit of Consolish gameplay, but in this case it works to give some quick fix fps shooting, nice graphics, good sound, good mouse and keyboard contoller support with adjustability,I personaly rate it a solid 6/10 , that is on a scale of which i would rate Borderlands a 9/10 if that helps with scale of rating in my opinion,  I recomend get while on one of the many sales steam has at the moment!
