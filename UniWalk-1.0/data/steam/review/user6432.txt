One of the best games i have ever played, easy to pick up yet hard to master, i have sunk hour into this and have many great stories. It is one of the few games that make you feel a conection with what your doing and every moment is special since the game can change in a second. I myself have play since the kickstart and have been involved in the amazing community as a modder, this game inspired me to follow my dreams of codeing and i hope you all give it a chance.
