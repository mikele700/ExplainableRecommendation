i was gonna update my review but it would end up being exactly the same as Atlas 141's review...to put it short though it's crysis.
Peice of ♥♥♥♥ unoptimised game, to make it worse it's p2w and matchmaking leveling is practically non-existant at level 10.Level♥♥♥♥ing10.Run on a mid range system or even just a tiny bit less?

Played about 1-2 years ago, was aids AF to play.Still aids AF to play.Rentable weaponslauncher's news works using IE, and the launcher if i remember correctly the launcher uses java/script (eitherway is bad)absolutly no matchmaking at all (will be pitted against level 30+'s 90% of the time [even max leveled])That's only the start of it.
I have better things to do than sit around for more than 30 minutes just to find nothing....
The game has gotten so bad that if it was fixed, still only the children would play this thing.Also what the devs do in every update is proof that they are humanoid gold fishes.
The game has very nice graphics, that could be improved on, as well nice smooth controls when skulking around (pun intended) as you don-'t have to constantly hold down CTRL like in -'AVP-' although you do find yourself stuck on little objects a fair bit ,and it is a challenge to sometimes get on the roof of a room however I-'m not saying that is a good idea as you will have trouble getting to your enemy before you get shot, making it sometimes difficult to get away. Although due to the small objects that are included you can-'t easily -'blend-' with the wall. You can, however, easily use the small pieces to do nice leaps from wall to wall to accelerate you.That was only talking about the graphics and skulk though! As the aliens (or Karah) you can evolve into different types; flying, slashing, -'tank-' and (the cute) support, allowing you to also evolve to the new types, each set with separate abilities.The marines look like they have it tough but in fact they do not as the marines being equip with an arsenal of ranged weapons, along with jet-packs, allow them to dodge attacks and kill something before it get to them...usually.It may seem that the game has a variation of 2 gametypes to play; fast and -'abusive-' or slow and stealthy, but there is also a third variation. The commander! Without the comm (commander) you will be screwed, and without a good comm you will also be screwed, as a comm on either team are required to be able to place support structures and upgrade you. This means that if you are more of a good strategy, top down, player then you don-'t have to go looking for another game, honestly its like 2 games in one!There-'s one major floor with some of the levels though; some are too wide. This makes it nearly impossible for the Karah to win. There are some rooms where the moment the marines capture it, the karah aren-'t able to even enter the room, as they are to wide open. There is also glitches in the maps that stop the comm from placing connection nodes called -cysts-, these cysts are the Karah-'s way of -'transferring energy-', where you are meant to be able to. An annoyance is that sometimes you will get base rushed and that-'s the end of the game...no joke, once your base is attacked within the first 15 minutes you are placed in a permanent disadvantage. This problem is in many games, though, and can not be solved by devs. So nearly every player on this game has a mutual understanding not to EGBR (Early Game Base Rush) so it is currently quite rare to see a base rush within 15 minutes or so of a match starting.Another major problem is the difficulty curve. Due to the fact that there is practically no training, trying to understand how to play properly and learn how to -'dodge bullets-' is simply not possible. The training in the game is mostly just a movement tutorial as the bots are very...unresponsive. Although there is a video tutorial which helps when trying to understand the games mechanics.In total NS2 is well balanced and if you stick with the game long enough it, will end up being incredibly fun. It only takes about 1 hour to fully understand the game... well for me it did.I almost forgot to mention the loading times take about 5-10 minutes....graphics: ++extremely smooth controls:+++multi-genre:++teams are nothing like each other:+++acceleration physics used as mechanic:++original character variety:++proper stealth mechanics:++character traits stay for only that character type:+MODDING SUPPORT:+bias maps:-map glitches:--EGBR problem:-anti EGBR community (mostly):+difficulty/learning curve: --training/practice mode:+helpful tutorial:++bad bot AI:-loading times:-scoring:22 pros8 constotal: 14 prosn=number of cons/pros totala=answer+/- depends on cons majority (-) or pros majority (+)0.16666666666666666666666666666667*n=a +/- 50.16666666666666666666666666666667*14=2.33334+5=7.3/10
The game, alike its brethren endless space, has stunning graphics however it is styled in 8-16 bit, i.e. the game keeps style with the old bit-like games but does not look completely like an old cartridge game. The game play is surprisingly smooth and easy to understand but the game gives quite the challenge regardless what character you have or how skilled you are. Every level and play through you will have to think strategically and place defences so, you also have to keep a constant watch on your hero-'s life as well make sure that your producers are all equal or close in production or focus mostly on one type. As you traverse through the seeming less endless floors, every item that you get holds a big value even if it is a stray jacket.There are a few glitches left in the game but all are being fixed quite constantly by a very active dev team which are probably the most friendly dev team you will ever come across and the community, even friendlier.The music is done by FlyByNo, the musician for the well known endless space, has again created more masterpieces. The music in this game is very well thought out as the music does not make you have to battle with it in order to think of strategies rather it helps you, while setting the mood and vibe very well. The calm music, slow paced and thought inventiveness is what makes the entire game so relaxing most of the time yet so frantic at others.The multiplayer, however, is still having difficulties but has only recently been released so is technically in beta still. The multiplayer, regardless of your upload speeds/download speeds, has a big lag problem which is getting much better slowly over time as it isn-'t amplitudes forte but they have worked with multiplayer on turn a based game before.At first glance the game looks entirely turn based, D.o.t.E. is part turn based, part strategy and part real time, the turn based comes from the doors and the material obtaining being that each -'turn-' is counted in doors. The strategy is obvious, planning where you will go and where certain things go along with the difficult choice of weather -should I have all defence in here or make it a place for my hero-'s to heal...or both?- will be asked about in every room that becomes available to you to place defences an the such. There is more strategy in the characters as well, as you will have to plan who gets what and who should have what role which becomes even larger and harder to do in multiplayer (more on that later), in fact you even have to plan your escape. Finally the real time comes down to doing all of the above whilst being attacked, placing defences, watching your health, equipping items, you name it, you can do it in real time when the waves of monsters are out.multiplayer doesn-'t only have problems with lag or randomly disconnecting but also somewhat in communication and majorly in sharing items. When there is an item no one knows what the chest holds so no one knows what the item is until they pick it up, once the item is picked up, instead of the item going into the global inventory it goes into the personal inventory which if you cant equip the said item for any reason, you cant drop it nor trade it in any way. This makes the game more difficult as loot gives more bonuses and traits than levelling meaning your entire team is more likely to die unless you all get lucky.Next problem is communication, due to the lag building things and claiming a room becomes more difficult as more than one person may try building/claiming at once. The only way around this currently is to let the host of the server to build/claim, meaning your entire team will depend on you if you are the host.All up the game is well balanced, not pain numbingly boring, even after a few plays, and looks very good for its chosen style.great graphics design: + + +smooth controls: + +very easily understandable: + + +simple tutorial: -+ +awesomely challenging: ++ +extremely well balanced: ++ +multi-genre: +++active devs: +extremely friendly devs: ++ +extremely friendly community: ++ +perfect music: +++ +multiplayer: +very laggy/disconnecting multiplayer: - ---very interesting mechanics: + + +mutiplayer inventory problem: --muliplayer communication problem: -34 pro-'s8 con-'stotal: 28 pro-'sn=number of cons/pros totala=answer+/- depends on cons majority (-) or pros majority (+)0.16666666666666666666666666666667*n=a +/- 50.16666666666666666666666666666667*26=4.3333333333333333333333333333334+5=9.33333333333333333333333333333349.3/10______________________________if the mutiplayer was fully fixed and the tutoral a bit more advanced i.e. more interactive it would be a 10/10
Very fun but slow at the start...which is about 1 or 2 hours of just trying to get stuf. Also ,in my experience, the game always tryes to kill you or at least screw with you.So its mainly a game where you can only have fun if you are playing with another person that you can trust throught the entire game, otherwise you WILL always die with about 0-1 blueprint actully being learnt.i.e.pro's: fun open world multiplayerlots of serversstable (for a alpha)allows easily to roleplaycon's:you will die withought someone's help i.e. fourced multiplaynot to easy to start playing withought pre-knowledge of how to play the game (requires you to do a tutorial thats not in game)'sneaking' dosen't work the best...but at least it sort of workscan easily get spawnkilledat night, if you have no flashlight or anything to do, you get bordservers arnt stable (but the game itself is [for a alpha]) so its not easy to battle even on 100 pingBut remember; this is a ALPHA so those type of con's are expected!
