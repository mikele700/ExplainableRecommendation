its finejust fine
this was i game that took a while to figer out how it works and how to launch it but once it works u will fell so happy.now gta iv is a great game and for me it wont lag if i put it on high settings(dont know why ive heard so much stuff about that this game can only be run with low setting) but i guess im just lucky .ps this game is not for noobs
i want to let u know how good this game is and how much it is like gta 5 or 4 well i mean gta has some more stuff but jc2 has a freaking grappling hook which is way more fun also friend request spudow4567 he is the best guy sadly he is bullyed a bit :{ :/
