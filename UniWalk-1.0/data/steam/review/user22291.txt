It's free and more importantly, it's fun. Theres no reason you shouldn't have this game. ♥♥♥♥ you if you leave a negative review.
Hats over Gameplay.... 10/10!
Less than 10 hours of content (good content at that). Buy it in a pack or on sale, otherwise, don't bother.
This game is ehh.
Play online if you want to meet and maybe even become the cancer of this world! 8/10, could do with less death threats and DDoS attempts!
Not as good as BL2, but still worth a play if you're a fan of the 2nd installment
Watched 3 naked men fight with rocks... 40 minutes after I first started playing, 10/10!
