Quite possibly one of my favourite games ever, Saint's Row III is serious about messing around.Aim of the game: shoot stuff, chainsaw stuff, explode stuff, run around naked while hitting stuff with a ♥♥♥♥♥/baseball bat.The possibilities are endless. Regardless of how many times the game glitched on me or just plain disturbed me I couldn't stay away. The fast paced combination of shooting, running, driving, flying, skydiving in a panda suit with a chainsaw, I just couldn't resist the simple, mindless fun of it all.Screwing around in sandbox mode is certainly more exciting than a mojority of the story and that's OK because the game is simply incredible.Flawed and Unfaithful to the previous games as SR3 is, it is still a brilliant game and totally worth your money.SO BUY IT.
