Although I love dead rising and played the ♥♥♥♥ out of it on the xbox, in its current state I can't recommend it. Although the performance is perfectly fine running at 1080p 60fps, there is a game breaking bug where the game refuses to save and instantly corrupts any auto-saves made. As there is no definitive solution for this glitch, this makes the game broken and unplayable.Once this issue is resolved, I will be changing this into a positive review.
The memory in this game leaks more than the Jennifer Lawrence nudes
Got plastic surgery to make my breasts as big as most of my torso and to be able to like nolan north before puberty, Stopped a nuke from launching by riding it, Became president, lost to an Alien, got put in a simulation, had pancakes,  decided that the pancakes were not up to my standards so I blew up the town, became bisexual while on a spaceship, gained superpowers, started practicing my WWE moves on civillans, killed a monster by punching it, killed Santa and stole a mech suit and blew up a alien shipThen I started playing Saints Row 4 and it was alright
