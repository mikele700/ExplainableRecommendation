This game is the best FPS i've ever played, it's got great maps even though there arn't a huge range of them there are still mods, and on that note the mods are very well done but some are a bit dodgy. The servers are well marked, people can be a*sholes online and can teamkill but you can kick and band them. People give this game sh*t a lot but the communtiy is really friendly not like CS GO..... (don't get me started.) Buy this game! Its really fun!  I recomend it 100%
