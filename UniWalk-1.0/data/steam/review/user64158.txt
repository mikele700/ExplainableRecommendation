This game is awesome. It has a unique and great style of combat. Great graphics also. The HUD is also great and really makes the -pilot- feel while playing. Two thumbs up. :bdCons: Is somehow looking like a pay-to-win since with cash you can literally get what you need in the long run. Unlocking early items and getting the mechs which somehow ruins the fun. But hey, it-'s F2P who am I to judge? :3
