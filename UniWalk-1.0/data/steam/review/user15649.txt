This game is a Remake of Half Life, bringing you up to date graphics and a great feeling to the environment that half life wasnt able to deliver back when it was first released. The game is very good in regards to the weapon mechanics, movement, graphics and combat. I believe the game is more difficult and more challenging than the original Half life. Unfortunately, the game did lack stability near the end where most of the boxes, dead enemies and environment furniture starts to bounce and sometimes would fling me up in the air or just get me stuck. This would be ammo, health packs and things that I would generally be able to loot would fall through the ground.This is truely one of the great remakes and even though there is due improvement, there is great potential for this game to be amazing.RATING: 7/10 - Highly recommended.
