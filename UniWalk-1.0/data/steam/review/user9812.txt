♥♥♥♥♥iest Horror game I ever played, didn't even take an hour to finish, horrible tension build-up and nothing scary about the game at allNEVER WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS STUPID GAME.
just like the classic Slenderman, but with a few differences, different story, different place, and it doesnt stop once you collect all the pages.if you found the original Slenderman scary, you might this one scary aswell.me personally, I didnt find it as scary, but the stary finds a way to slowly creep you out like Silent Hill does but in a clever way!
