https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQxg40wctA RIP payday, you were a good friend....Sadly you were brought down by your friends (CSGO and TF2). You have to get off it man, leave the microtransactions behind, your tearing this community APART. I will always remember the payday that said -No. No. God, I hope not- about microtransactions, I want you to be remembered for the amazing game you were and not what you have become, a lair and sell out. RIP to my old friend and sadly I will never hear a cloaker again (Clicks uninstall button).
