This is my review of Life is Strange, and before I say anything you should buy and play this game right now because if you like games like Telltale's TWD you'll love this game. Now, onto my review. I loved the characters, the world, the concept and the story. But I have two major problems: The illusion of choice and episode 5. This game clearly had some-I mean lots of inspirations from Telltale's game, but they made the same mistake Telltale did, the choices don't really matter. It's all an illusion. And this ties with episode 5. Don't get me wrong the episode fine, but the ending was poorly written and lazy. I mean there were thousands of possibilities but there are only two endings and it felt lazy and it felt like everything I did was wasted because of the ending, and if you played the game you know what I mean. Hopefully the devs behind this awesome game will learn from their mistakes and makes games better than this one. Now with the review over it's time to give a score. This game is a solid 7.5/10 it's a pretty good game, even if it's short, but it's something I expected from this kind game. I hope this review was useful to someone out there. Now, if you'll excuse I have a lot of grammatical erros to adjust. (though there will be some punctuation erros)
