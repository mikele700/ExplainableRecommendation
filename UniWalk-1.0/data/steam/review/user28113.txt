FEEL YOUR FINGERS FORGET SIMPLE CONCEPTS LIKE RIGHT AND LEFT. PERSONIFY LITTLE TRIANGLES AND ABHOR ANYTHING WITH MORE THAN THREE SIDES. THIS GAME WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.
all my friends play this game. it has taken from me money, time and effort. in return i have lost my faith in humanity and i doubt everyone i meet and their ability to ward. my life is ruined and i have never been happier.
It's like Starcraft without the Koreans.It's like Dota without the Russians.It's like TF2 without the hats.Xenophobic genocidal violence at it's chaotic best.
A simple concept which is a solid ton of fun. The puzzles will boggle your head no end (hint: translations) and the beautiful 8bit-esque graphics and sounds will tug at your nostalgias. PLUS IT HAS A FEZ HOW COOL IS THAT COME ON SOMEBODY. Great depth, detail and gameplay in one casual (ish) gaming package.p.s.
