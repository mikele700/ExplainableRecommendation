MVM tours have the biggest aspect of a 'team' in itOtherwise your just shooting everyone with 0 concideration. Taking a large health kit when you are healthy and you leave your 5hp injured team mate to suffer, emptying your wallet, buying hats, selling those hats to get an unusual, then trade that unusual for a ghostly gibus in a carefuly wrapped gift, crying, buying more hats, burning people, buying hats again until you look superior to everyone else. But then some nub with a gibus & a mercanery badge dominates you and so you rage quit and sell your entire backpack on the market & loose another 15% of your $ so you check your bank account balance & owe $150your lil' wallet will look like a dry prune @ the end of your tf career11/10No that was all a joke, great game
