It is a very realistic and medium open world type of game. The graphics are amazing at full res and the gameplay is awesome I really suggest this game
Goat Simulator is a fun messed up game. It has a great idea to it giving players to just destroy everything they see and make it half free roam with all these secrets and collectables.
