My god I love this game. I'm not sure what the entire game is like because I only played Karin's story but I loved it to bits. The entire plot is great and is super heart warming. You really start to warm up to the characters and I wouldn't be surprised if people actually started having full fledged crushes on some of the main characters. It gets a little bit boring at times but it was probably just me being impatient. I'm gonna get my friends to check out this game because every time I play it makes me fell so happy it's crazy. It would make me the happiest person ever if you made  a sequel where you go back to live with them after either breaking up with the one you chose or continuing the story with the relationship still going. Either way I would love to see some sort of follow up. You have my full support the whole way. (Also can I just say that the soundtrack is amazing and I would've loved to here some more songs with lyrics or just somewhere I can get the mp3s to this game because I would listen to them every day) It would probably ruin the point of the story but I would love to see this english dubbed one day. I would replay the entire game.
