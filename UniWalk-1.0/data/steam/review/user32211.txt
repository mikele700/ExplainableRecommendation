Still not global elite after wasting a year. I recommend to people who have suicidal tendencies and do not care for lives. After installing this game, please hang yourself at Google hangouts. A real hangout. Also if you install this game, you can get an expansion pack that provides sunlight and a soccer ball. If you do have a girlfriend, I recommend not playing this game because it encourages aggression on the other hand, if your girlfriend likes BDSM all for it. Also, this game dissolves relationships among your friends and promotes being an a55hole. For example, my friend who complains about CS;GO and how he is held back and blames his team mates has now become alot more aggresive and annoying in real life. CS;GO is bad for our youth and encourages offensive language and behavior.There are 4 types of people who play CSGO:1. The Competitive ♥♥♥♥♥♥s (me)2. The Casuals3. The Surfers4. The Bunny ♥♥♥♥♥♥sTL;DR: CS;GO is bad for people who have a functional life but good for people who live in their mum's basement. CS;GO is bad for our youth.
