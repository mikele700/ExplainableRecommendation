I guess it's ok. Very little upgrade in textures, underwhelming graphics settings, but other than that it is fine (no bugs I have run into). Can barely recommend this.
Absolutely beautiful game. While the ending might not be the best, the journey is incredibly awesome. Since Ep. 1 is free, you have no reason not to play it.9/10, wish I could play it again for the first time.
Really cool idea, 10/10 would recommend for the 7mb download and 10 minutes
It's pretty damn good DLC to be completely honest with you. The high detail on the car, and attention to detail with the sounds and visuals are amazing. For a BTTF fan this is a must have. However, it has no customisation whatsoever. That's a pretty big downer, but it's so good nonetheless, customisation would have just added the cherry to the top.
A must buy for anyone into rally or racing sims.
