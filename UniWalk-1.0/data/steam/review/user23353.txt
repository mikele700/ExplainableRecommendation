Very different to the average FPS. I like it.
Probably one of the best sandboxes ever.The first thing I would say about this game is the amount of addons (If you can think of something it will most likely be an addon) The freedom to do almost everything you want, from making contraptions, 3D art, cooperative maps to multiplayer game modesThe features allow you to manipulate objects (You can change colour, texture, poses, physics, AI behaviour and much more)You can have fun by your self in sandbox or online but i recommend playing with friendsThe only con I can think of is hardware:It requires little hardware for minor things but like all sandbox games it requires a powerful computer to process everything a a large hard drive for everything
