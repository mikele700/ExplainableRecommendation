Now before I begin, Team Fortress 2 is an epic first person shooter game from the start. A summary of the story would be how two companies (teams) are fighting to claim land. 9 mercenaries have been hired to fight for the land. Each mercenary is quite different from each other, and have their own specific role. The game is quite fun and is mostly focuses on team work, and communicating. You also find and trade tons of weapons, gear and, hats throughout the game. The game is not pay to win as you can find every weapon in the game :P, and if you find the same weapon you can craft them into different weapons or hats!!! Another alternative is to trade with your friends online, or to buy them in the shop. Unlike most other games, team fortress 2 has many game modes, a few of them are: CTF, KOTH (King of the Hill), Payload( Move a bomb into the enemies base, and watch as it explodes :D), Capture control points, and boss fights! There are tons of maps you can play some made by the creators of tf2, Valve, and custom maps made by awesome people like yourself. There are many cool updates, in which new equipment and maps are added to the game. Want to see what people have created, and hope in adding? Then, visit the steam workshop for tf2 and explore! Hey, did I mention that even you, yes YOU can create an item in hope of it getting added to the game :D And on top of that people create thousands of funny, amazing animations using SFM(Source film maker) using TF2 :D. O and if you want to be different from the rest, well not to worry as you can customize how your mercenaries look like with hats, cosmetics and even more hats :D!Would rate it a 100/10
