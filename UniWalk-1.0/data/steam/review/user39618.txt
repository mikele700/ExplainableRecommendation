You either die a noob or live long enough to be called a hacker.I've been playing this game quite extensively for the past month now, I started out in Gold Nova 2 and im now DMG 1. The game has a steep learning curve especially if you're more accustomed to other fps games. It takes a while to adjust and adapt to the mechanics but its one of the most rewarding experiences once you actually become decent and can get headshots consistently.
