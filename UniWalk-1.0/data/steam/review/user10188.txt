Great game scott I love the Storyline of the 4 games however i only played the first one :( i wish i can play more but its way too scary BTW great jumpscares
i love the creativity because you can build what ever you want.i have only 2 dislikes you can't edit an enemys health and make then harder to kill and you can not give many NPCs a sertain Weapon like a lightsaber.However I would give it a 9/10:)
