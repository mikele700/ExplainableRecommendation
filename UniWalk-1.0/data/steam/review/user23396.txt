Buy it so the devs can make it good pls.
Amazing experience. Get it when it is cheap cause the playtime is less than 2 hours (any cod campaign).
This game is good
I'd give it a year
Absolute waste of my life. First of all (despite what it says on steam), The Darkness II has not yet been optimised for Mac computers which is an absolute let down/waste of money. Don't get me wrong, i'm sure that the game is great, but from what i've seen so far playing on a high spec mac computer, is a pile of ♥♥♥♥. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT buy this game unless you are 100% sure that you have a working PC and not a mac. I want my money back you sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.
Twelvies! Twelvies everywhere!
No matter how much you try. You will always hit the ♥♥♥♥ing corner
Great game. It's like dayz except you get to kill zombies with spoons
Very fun once you get used to it. Still looking for people to play with though.
