Fun game to play which runs on lower end hardware but also takes advantage of higher end ones with good anti aliasing (MSAA), graphical quality, etc. The classical maps which is revamped with the newer Source Engine looks great.The 10% extra over the 5% (total 15%) steam market tax is too high and should be lowered as this negatively affects CS:GO sellers and buyers.In terms of game quality, CS:GO is a very addictive and offers fun content as many people play online both competitively and casually.Over all great game 9/10
Fun relaxing fps game to play... Good thing it works on lower end PCs as well. :)
Simply amazing game. You can tell by how many people still play it; and it was realeased back in 2006. Awesome addons such as FTX Global, PMDG, etc. make the game even better and the multiplayer brings it to life. Occasionally you go online and realise the a kid is flying the plane and annoying you :P. Definitely get this game, even if you don't know ANYTHING about flying; you will learn as you play it. (just like me).
