This game is one of those games that are great, fun and a bit addictive but no one can know you play it. 10/10

I spent 5 minutes playing this then i realised that fish are eating each other! We need to fix this problem in the game it's a massive bug the FISH EAT EACH OTHER!?
10/10 would massacre jews again
(At time of review i've played 6hrs and lvl 5)So far this game is fun, it offers fun kinda tactical gamplay and the 3 loadout/class system is a great addition to class based shooters. I would recommend getting it's a 9/10 from me just because the rhino class is unbalanced and the maps sometimes have to many bottlenecks.P.S You can run around and kill people with  cricket bats, it's fun smashing in someones skull with a cricket bat
Good fun addition ot the series
It's a fun creative game with a spin on the alternative arena deathmatch. The large amount of possiblities make this game very enjoyable. At times it can be a bit grindy and doesn't have much in the way of a tutorial but it works in the end just use the internet. 9/10 :)
