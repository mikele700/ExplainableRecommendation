Recommended to fans of South Park. A thoroughly disgusting, yet awesome, interactive episode of South Park hidden beneath the thin veneer of an RPG.
Counter-Strike has been around forever and is a competitive FPS staple. The main problem for the casual player is the cancerous community. When playing competitive mode, the higher a players rank goes, the more disillusioned they are likely to become with their fellow players. It would appear that 30-40% of all players are sociopathic teenage boys with severe behavioural problems and high pitched screamy voices.
