As it stands this game has a long way to go.Improvements that should be made:1.-tUn-optimised game2.-tslow frame rate 3.-tbuggy ragdolls4.-tBoring grindy leveling and dinosaur capture system5.-tChallenging in the wrong ways6.-tCombat is to easy and uses no real unique mechanics7.-tLevelling is used for too much (in terms of craftables)8.-tLevelling web like Robo-craft or Kerbal SP would be better9.-tResources are too difficult to obtain10.-tBuilding takes too much in terms of resources (makes the game more grindy than it should be)11.-tLoot is stupid meat rots to fast and you should get more for the kill: bones, teeth, skulls, and the stomach contents of the animal (berryâ€™s, bones, meat, plant fibre) 12.-tIf levelling system is kept greater reward for kills in terms of XP is need (currently collecting berries is the most effective form of levelling)13.-tHunting should include more depth (tracking sent trails ECT should be added)14.-tRiding is a pain: no backwards movement15.-tDifferent types of meat should be included for taming dinosaurs16.-tLess dinosaurs more mammals small rodents and herbivores17.-tMore server slots needed18.   Oil and other late game ingredients are to hard to getbut to be honest it is just perfect the way it is :)
To be fair i didnt get my $60 USD moneys worth.Its not a fun game.Its not being updated fast enough.I dont like it.It is insainly boring mine fly, mine fly to create another instance where you can mine and fly WTF is the point in this game. No mans sky:Exploring the worlds most boring sandbox has never been so anoying!
