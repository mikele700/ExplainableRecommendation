Medieval II: Total War is a pretty average vanilla game.When you add mods however like Stainless Steel, Broken Crescent, Third Age and many more, it goes from a average game to an AMAZING GAME!!!.I would totally encourage you to buy this game if you a) Like using mods in gamesb) Love the medieval era and all it's crazinessandc) If you like creating an empire that will soon rule all of Europe
