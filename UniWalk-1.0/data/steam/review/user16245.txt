ok so i'm saying no because i had the solar eruption (a weapon) i used it i died lost checked where i died counldn't find it gone well there goes one of my best weapons unless Duke Fishron stole it then i don't know maybe bugged but that is just bad
really good but i haven't seen the neon corrals other than that really good but i think these corrals now are better maybe a thing where you have to feed the chickens but its good. Indigo quarry needs more areas and there needs to be more expansion places like (the grotto)  maybe an area where like  oca oca grow and maybe other stuff not in the overgrowth maybe like higher teer chickens but start of as chicks and i hope this game gets steam workshop gg
