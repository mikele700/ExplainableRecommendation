For what it is and the story into making this game, its quite fascinating. Gameplay is incredibly fun and has depth to it. Optimization is lacking to say the least and PROBABLY be fixed before it releases. I would recommend if you like this type of game and don't be afraid to pick it up. Be warned however this is a early access game, stuff WILL change before release!
One of the best games of 2013!!! Mixture of MotherLoad, Minecraft, Terraria and Spelunky, A Visual Feast and has an amazing story.Sad to put it down after playing it for about 4-6 hours.
