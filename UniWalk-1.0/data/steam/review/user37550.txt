i love this game its one of my favorits but the one thing i hate is that you have to wait for a mounth or two like the episode 2 has not came out for me yet and its been like good three,two mounths now but the suspence is really good for the game if there was a raiting i give it a 9 out of 10 but i like this game its got fresh and new ideas and thats really good
