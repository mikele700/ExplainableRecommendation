RuneScape and Diablo had kinky sex while Touhou was watching. This thing came about 9 months later.AND I LOVE IT.
This game is like a satisfying mix of World of Warcraft and top-down Legend of Zelda games. The artstyle is really nice, and there's a lot of depth to this seemingly simple and childish game. There are so many different ways to build your character, and there's an armour, weapon or pet that accomodates your desires for any playstyle, be it a tanky melee fighter, a powerful ranged DPS or an AoE support. is rly good
