I mainlined a mixture of ground-up first-aid kits and plastic explosive and dodged bullets.10/10
I shot the Sheriff.And I didn't spare no deputy.
SCREEEEEThis -♥♥♥♥ing- sound will get embedded into your mind, should you play this game. Every time you kill a tyranid, every damn time you're attacked, any time you're so much as on a map containing the little buggers, you're going to hear this sound.A lot.Do your sanity a favour, and turn off your SFX volume, it's not too important.Gud game tho.Heresy/10
HNNN! HRK! HNNN! *SPLATCH*NNNN! HRNG! RAAGH!If you like the concept of being a mute nerd in a suit and killing tentacle zombies with industrial equipment, this is the game for you.
