This Game Is AMAZING.. Once you get past the 1st section of the game which equals spending alot of time on a planet called TARIS...But the game has great story telling where every decision you make could change you or the people around you...I love this game i would easily recomened the to anyone who is a true fan of Star Wars..11/10
10/10 Its SimCity just had sex with Age of Empires and made Banished. There is no army or combat just basic fun and relaxing town building. NOT MADE BY EA!!! :). Really Indepth and really addicting. The feeling of building a whole new town and having tons of people then to see it get washed away with a natural deaster gives you the feeling that you should not quit and make a new world but help out the poor civs rebuild there lives again.Personally its a Awesome game and i would deffintently recomend it..(Sorry For ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Spelling)
