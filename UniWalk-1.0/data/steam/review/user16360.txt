-We-'ve made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!)-Remember that? Well they just added microtransactions. A game with tons of DLCs, and they added micro-transactions on day 1 of Crimefest, which was supposed to be -free content-. That-'s just a slap in the face for all the veterans who bought most or all of the DLCs. You thought this couldn-'t get any worse? Well you-'re wrong. Where-'s did the 250.000 dollars prize for the Paydaycon went? Why is the FBI files function almost the exact same way PD2stats? Hypetrain, The walking dead advertisements, Completely Overkill Pack, more lies. The list just keeps expanding.So, is it a good game?Yes, before the whole microtransactions fest.But, the stat boost isn-'t that big.It-'s not about the stat boosts, it-'s about them lyingShould I buy this game?Nope, nope, nope, and nope. Even if they removed the micro-transactions, this shows that Overkill can drop a big ♥♥♥♥ you to us. Go buy something else, stay away from this once good game but now ruined by Overkill.
