LEGENDARY, have hundreds of hours on console and the PC version is just that much better. First Person Shooters don't get much better than this.
One of the best sandbox gangster games i've ever played, definitely sets itself apart from other titles such as GTA or Saints Row, the intense storyine mixed with unique hand to hand fighting and brilliant driving mechanics makes this a memorable experience with a strong impact upon gang relation.
most ♥♥♥♥tastic shooter i have ever played. i have unloaded so much of my life into this game and i have regretted none of it. most of my best gaming memories have come out of this delicious peice of coding
