A great game, cool and epic battles and units
Fun to play, however it sometimes tuff to turn around and shoot
very addicting, very fun and very cool. BUY IT!!!
This game is quite good in combat, in some good areas of campaign and maybe a little bit of multiplayer. However I'm dissapointed in the acheivements. I play many nations in the grand campaign on easy and normal to earn the the level acheivements, however I still didn't get it. I even conqured india to earn that conquest of india acheivement and I still didn't get it. This game has screwed me over the acheivements, however if u play all the nations and still have fun with the multiplayer ur going to love it.
This game does get addicting as you play it for hours!!!!!
VERY FUN and VERY COOL!!!!!!!!!!
