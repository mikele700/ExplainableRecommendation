I have been playing Payday 2 off and on since it came out. I have bought all of their DLCs (Even the Completely Overkill Pack) so that i could support OVERKILL and help them bring new content to this game. But the new Weapon rebalance and Black market update have destroyed all faith i had in OVERKILL. If you have played CS: GO or have seen crate openings, it’s exactly the same thing. When you complete a heist, you may earn a safe that can only be opened by purchasing a drill. When you open the safe, you'll earn a random weapon skin with a random condition ranging from Broken-in (Battle Scarred) to Mint-Condition (Factory New). This would be alright, if it wasn't for one detail. Weapon skins can give you stat buffs. That’s right, a cosmetic actually improves the killing power of the weapon. It might improve accuracy, stability or total ammo, pretty much any stat. Who thought this was a good idea? This is a Pay to Win Mechanic. And the weapon rebalance has destroyed the weapons, either making a weapon extremely under powered or over powered. Revolvers do more damage than some sniper rifles, a DMR does more damage than a sniper, all shotguns except for double barrelled shotguns were nerfed to oblivion and most pistols are one shotting enemies on the highest difficulty. These changes have rendered the game completely unplayable and i will not be returning to Payday 2 until these issues have been fixed. (I should also mention a humorous bug that is currently in the game. The Minigun used to give a movement penalty and had mods that would reduce the movement penalty. They removed the Minigun movement penalty but not the mods ability to increase speed, meaning with both speed increasing mods for the Minigun, you run faster with it equipped than any other weapon)
