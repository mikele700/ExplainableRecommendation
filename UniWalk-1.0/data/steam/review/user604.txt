Well what can I say, really? For a game that's in its alpha stage development I have never loved any game so much. Despite the fact that I can see this game having a lot more features and fixes added into it (I started playing recently in Alpha 10.4), in my oppinion its so far very in my oppinion realistic when it comes to survival, and very addictive; you are just dying to get the game right when you first try it out. For those of you who posted negative feedback on 7 Days to Die, I have got no idea what you're crying about, because this game just blew me away! I fully reccomend this game to anyone who is interested!
