Nobody plays this game... How do I play clan wars with no clans?
It's just meh... game is dead as of right now.
Full in-game immersion, that's enough to rate this game a 10/10 already and play it all day long. It's a PC Gameplay Masterpiece and no consoleboy game will ever touch the heights that ArmA reached.
It's kinda nice.
Thank you, Canada! You can turn Heroic Ballads into Godless Howling!
