You can do what you want in this game, if it even is a game... You can make a rocket ship that explodes into a million golden flaming genitalia of doom, or you can fly around in a hoverboat entireley constructed out of wood and television sets. My favourite thing to do is spawn a mob of zombies, and whack them all over the head with a ♥♥♥♥♥ that is conveniently merged onto a drill. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to do something that their parents would not actually allow you to do. Like the above examples.

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME: - buy it - just freaking buy it - start up the game - finish the first third of the main quest - go to the college of winterhold - get involved with the college of winterhold quest - finish that quest - wonder why the game finished so quickly - ask a friend - friend tells you that the College of Winterhold quest was just a side-quest, not the main quest - get even more confused - finally retrieve the horn of Jurgen Windcaller - continue from there - fight Alduin on the Throat of the World - do some elder scrolls ♥♥♥♥ - go the sovengarde or some ♥♥♥♥ - fight Alduin once again - kill him - go back to the throat of the world - wonder why the final boss fight with Alduin was just freaking easy - watch as a bunch of dragons salute you - wonder where the end credits went - close the game  - open the steam workshop page - download 50 skyrim mods - wait for thirty hours because your internet supplier is Dodo - start up the game - play for 200 hours more because of the mods - close the game - sleep - wake up - download 100 more mods - open the game - get an average of 15 fps because you accidentally installed an ENB - put out the fire that your shoddy amd radeon r7 created - look  at your monitor - bask in the next-gen x2 graphics that is a skyrim ENB - watch as your fps goes down to 2 fps as a chicken runs towards you - get blown up by a kamikaze chicken - respawn - get rekt by thomas the tank engine dragon - skyrim crashes - uninstall a few mods - waste the next 500 hours of your life on this game - die of starvation because you have not eaten in two weeksyeah so this game is better than 90% of games on steam

It's weird how not many people have created their guns to resemble something phallicI thought there would be more9/10 would spend hours making skins again
This game's community is very unlike other multiplayer shooter's communities.Unlike any CoD games, and unlike TF2, this game does not really have any 5-9 year-olds playing.The community is made up of people who want to have a good time, and want others to have one too.No one in the community claims they had sex with your mother.The community just wants to tell of stories of their personal lives, or discuss current events.Buy this game.The people are nice.oh and its pretty fun, too
Y O U   M U R D E R E D   H E R,   A N D   Y O U   W E N T   B A C K   B E C A U S E   Y O U   R E G R E T T E D   I T.-I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself because I then realised that Flowey could see through my save files. It's true, I killed Toriel the first time, and I did not mean it. I was trying to do a pacifist run.10/10 would cry myself to sleep in fear again
9/10 would- get my shoddy PC rekt by graphics- Get blown up by surprise butt-hole missiles- wonder why its free- get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off because I'm not rich enough to afford better mechs- get my shoddy PC rekt by so much action- wonder why strange blue tiles are blocking me from flying out of the map- get blown up because my framerate ranges from around 10-25 fps- spend most of my time in the air, avoiding getting shot down by surprise butt-hole missilesagainI recommend this game to people who have patience, a good PC, reasonable download speeds, ping that is below 100, and if you like penguins.And mechs, i guess
