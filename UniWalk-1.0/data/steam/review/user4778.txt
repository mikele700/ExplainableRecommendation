The tactical turn based strategy supports the story, rather than the traditional way of having the story string the strategy elements together. Very well polished and atmospheric, although some choices come out of left field. Best bet is to let yourself go and roll with the punches that the game dishes out; you'll get a much more satisfying experience.
