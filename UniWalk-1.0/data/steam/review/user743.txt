Make sure you dont need to ever eat dinner while playing competetive, my first cooldown for leaving was 24 hours :3
I killed a giant ancient alien warrior with a pistol...Amazing.
The name jfiam5udeh was taken... Best name maker simulator i've ever seen 10/10
The journey through the game was very fun (and very difficult), and made me laugh while also making me want to stab myself in the eye with a screwdriver.The ending was amazing, my friend and I were so happy we made it to the end, and also super relieved we didn't have to torture ourselves any longer. 10/10 - Make sure no charp objects are near when playing.
I got the 500 attempts achievement. Pretty much explains my experience with this game... Still fun tho
You can kill a shark with a flare gun.  If i were to give a reason to not buy the game, it's the fact that you nead Uplay... Uplay sucks ♥♥♥9/10
You can throw melons at people.10/10
