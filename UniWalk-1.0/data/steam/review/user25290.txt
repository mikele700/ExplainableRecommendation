100 hours in and I want more! I can move through maps maps like I'm flying and rack up the kills, what more do you want. An easy map editor that you can use to build maps with friends too, well theres that :P.Its a seriously deep game where you can find action quick with only 10 minutes duals unlike other big fps games that take an hour for a game.   Reflex also allows for you to edit how the game looks like how you want, no creative lock that the devs force onto you. Right now don't display the gun models but have the colour of my crosshair showing what gun I have which is nice.10/10 will play again!
