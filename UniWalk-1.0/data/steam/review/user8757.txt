After paining my way to get all the achievements, this game has left a bad taste in my mouth.
3min into the game.Hear the characters voices.My body instantly cringes and my spine develops scoliosis on the spot.
I'm writing this review because... about a year ago i found this game and thought i could easily 100% it. 1 year later...Coming up on 300hours played and only 3 more achievements to go. If i wasn't for the solid 350 ping cause of the servers being hosted in america (I'm Australian) I'd probably be done with this game, but no i have to endure young children and preteens type nonsensical gibberish in the chat.But there is solution yet at a terrible cost. Too easily get one of these achievements I can go to the music room where most players lack the cognitive abilities to past the map, but the room it self is where you can post youtube urls and listen to music. Which ends up me listening to ♥♥♥♥ posting videos louder then a jet engine, watching anime, anime remixes, nightcore and other monstrosities.Other then the brain/soul destroying environment that I'd say it's a pretty good game.I rate 9/11
Wanted to play this game.But i couldn't because of the insufferable control scheme and a mouse sensitivity akin too micheal j fox being a brain surgeon.
Awesome game!
