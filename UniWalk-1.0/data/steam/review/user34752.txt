No i wouldnt recommend this game, its the biggest hunk of ♥♥♥♥ ive ever played
Great game so much better than the origional mod i really like what theyve done to it and look forward to seeing it evolve over time into beta
great game stopped playing though untill standalone, as there was too many bugs however the standalone looks promosing i just wich dean hall would give us some insight on the release date but hes gone completely silent wich i guess is a hint maybe...
great game but if you dont play for a while then come back to it you get pwned
THIS DAM GAME IS SEXY
