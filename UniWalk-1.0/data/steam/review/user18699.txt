Excellent game in all aspects, it certainly deserved the reviews it got. However, the problem I had was that it's a pain using a keyboard rather than buying a controller as the game was designed for controller. Bare that in mind before purchase. Luckily the excellent story and gameplay took my mind off this mostly, so it wasn't a major issue.
