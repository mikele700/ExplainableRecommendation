This game has wasted my life I have played since 2006. At first it seems boring and think this game is stupid but then after a while you get addicted it is absolutly no fun at all just press 1 button to kill something and keep doing that over and over until u lvl up.But the desire to get new better equipment keeps you going grinding forcing yourself to play through this boredom for better equipment.Since I started playing so much stupid random things have been added so much that any person who is not willing to play litrally 24/7 could not possibly do everything or obtain everything on this game, BUT you could pay nexon of course and save all that time to get your rewards and obtain whatever you want as long as nexon gets into your wallet.This game is pay2win nexon and the most greedy corporation you could imagine I played for sooo long at know the ins and outs of this game but still im considered a noob because I have bad damage and equipment because I did not pay any money for equipment or damage therefore I am noob even though I know exactly how this game works, have played for ages the fact that no money was spent I have very low damage.Nexon do not care that your accounts get hacked their support system takes ages to get back to you and when it does get back to you they do nothing to help you anyway. Hackers run the game and nexon pretends that they care. If you did pay money for this game and want to buy end game equipment well guess what? nexon says that is illegal your only allowed to carry 10b at one time and end game equipments can be worth 100b+ making scams easier. Don't waste your time with this game... Unless you are very rich and willing to pay thousands of dollars for some pixels.
