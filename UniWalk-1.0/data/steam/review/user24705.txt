People always say you need food, water and oxygen to live. I object. Basic humans need food, water, oxygen and dota to live. Controlling your addiction is one thing. Curbing it is another. I never would recommend the latter. Taking away that one precious 1 hour of dota2 a week will make you suffocate. 2 weeks, and you will start to feel nauseous. In the 3rd week you-'ll start to develop -finishing all homework- syndrome, which is not only bad, but contagious. Dota2 made my life better, but more so complete. I highly recommend Dota 2, Play dota 2 now and live a complete life lel.
