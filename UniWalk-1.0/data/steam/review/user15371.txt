Excellent game.Particularly since the recent December 2015 updates.Strategic options with the addition of numerous new ships  have grown significantly opening up some great play.Good graphics and sound design all help make this game very much a keeper, particularly impressive as it is still in Alpha.Give it a go if you like A) Sci-Fi settings and B) games that reward thought, timing, positioning and teamwork.
