HIGHLY RECOMMEND IF YOU LIKE TO FARM FOR YOUR EGO.
This is probably one of the stupidest games on Steam and I love it.10/10 I cried bullets
I noticed a few people in my friends list playing this game, and I also saw it on the front page of the store, seeing that it was free, I decided to check it out. When I first started, I had no idea what I was doing, looted a few places, ate maybe 3 berries and ended up dying of poisoning.After maybe 3 days of just leaving it be, I decided to REALLY try to get into it.Crafting is a bit complitcated, but once you recipes multiple times you start to get used to it, but it's always nice to have the wiki up just in case.Weapons are great, and finding all the ammo you need to for them can take time, but soon, you will become unstoppable.Watch a few guided on Youtube and you'll get the idea pretty quick on what to do.I really do recommend this game, it's great fun, and I've only done the single player, so I can't even imagine what it's like with a friend. Since the game IS in early access, I'm really looking forward on what this guy's gonna do in the next updates. If this game can get some open source stuff going on, it could be up there with DayZ and the other great zombie games.So play it, and while you're at it, buy a Gold account, you can get some cool stuff for your character and the game, and it helps support Nelson.
