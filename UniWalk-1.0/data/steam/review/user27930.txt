War Thunder is an Epic Free MMO available on Steam. If you loved Ace Combat or World of Tanks this is for you. Best WW2 Combat Flight Simulator to date.
I loved AVP and AVP2 when they were released back in early 2000. AVP2 Gold sets the benchmark of this franchise and I would still play that over the latest AVP from rebellion. It lacks some of the original features and gameplay with poor mechanics and lack of depth and feel in single and multiplayer.
Loads of fun shooting up zombies and multiplayer. Can be a bit repetitive after time.
