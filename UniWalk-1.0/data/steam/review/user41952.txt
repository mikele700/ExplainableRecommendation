This is my first review of a game, I usually never do this but this game deserves it, it-'s a nice sandbox game similar to minecraft, and the reviews other people have posted are true, this is truly a great game where you can express most of your imagination into with Lego, when I was a kid I always used to play with it and make weird cars, or buildings or anything else really, and now I can virtually do that! but overall this game is amazing, the camera can be a little dodgy however and when it comes to building sometimes too, but they-'re really the only minor cons in this game, nothing to say -this game is crap now because of these cons!- but besides those it-'s worth buying and trying out yourself if you haven-'t bought it or played it yet.I do hope as well that the developers will include most of their Lego franchises into the game, such as Star Wars and Jurassic Park, Batman and Marvel, etc., like being able to drive your own X-Wing or Batmobile, even make a Batcave and all sorts, and hopefully later on will be able to build and drive our own vehicles too. Either way I recommend this!Thanks for reading :D
This is a great game with variety mixing swordplay and sourcery, players will experience great dominance over the opposing team or other players in free for all, it's a success and I personally love it. Recommended for everyone.
