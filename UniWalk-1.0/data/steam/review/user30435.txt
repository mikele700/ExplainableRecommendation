Has a Beartooth Music Kit and I can use the assets from this game in Garry's Mod.Worth it.
People will kick your ♥♥♥.
How did Bain find Sokol?On Grindr. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Can't go bowling with your cousin. Bad game.0/10
I started playing because of the Edgy trailer.
This game made me bisexual.Just kidding, I was already bisexual, but if you like extreme homosexual grunting, male noises, cosmetics that dress you like a gimp and a rauchy title name this game is for you.Observe dong.
3spooky5me.Literally, I'm more scared of dying of cancer or in a plane crash or hair loss, not a fictional pair of hands being pulled over my eyes.
I vastly like this game, except now, having mods disables your chances at getting achievements. I can see the fairness in that, but what if we're talking non-gameplay advantage mods like graphical and audio mods? Nope, achievements disabled.You need to have a bland experience if you want to get those achievements.Really Bethesda. You should honestly leave the Fallout Titles to Obsidian, at least they won't screw up the fanchise you've adopted.
