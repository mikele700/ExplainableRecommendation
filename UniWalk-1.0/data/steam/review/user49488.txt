One of the more atmopheric games i've played with one of the best soundtracks i've ever heard. I had this game open in the background just for the music until i found i could buy the soundtrack!
Highly recommend; heaps of fun and very challenging.

Is Corvo the most deadly assassin ever?
Arguably one of the best games ever made, including Ep. 1 & 2
