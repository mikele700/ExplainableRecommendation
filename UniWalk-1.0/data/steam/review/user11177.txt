Fantastic game. Great gameplay, great shooting, and the soundtrack is phenomenal. In fact, the game is worth playing for the soundtrack alone.
Excellent game. Well worth picking up if you are a fan of Arkham Asylum. The narrative isn't as strong as its' predecessor due to  the open world nature, but it is still very good. Highly recommend.
