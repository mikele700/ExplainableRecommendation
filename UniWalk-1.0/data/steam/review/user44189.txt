This game has a lot of potential,however we are limited to only controlling our main hero and not other units.So,I decided to train more troops and let my hero stay clear from most battles,this led me to losing the match.When you are outleved by your enemy more 2 levels,dont even try to play,just surrender if you can.This is because no matter how hard you try,if the enemy hero is the same as you but 2 levels higher,you cant win the fight.The units counter each other but in the endgame many units are rendered useless as there is the artillery tower that insta-kills axe men and archers.You also can screw up very easily in this game,if you do,just surrender for christ sake as your units stumble their way through the lane,dying and feeding the enemy hero.The player count is also extremely low as I played with the same person for 5 times,and he is of higher rank than me,so that makes my beginners experience extremely poor.The controls are confusing at first,but once you get the hang of it,you're fine.The fullscreen option is bugged as it does not correctly fit my monitor screen.The conclusion is,this game is fun,loads of fun.Being an early access game,I can see this game improving more and more.I hope to see more upgrades to the towers and more unit types to add to the variety of the game as a whole.
