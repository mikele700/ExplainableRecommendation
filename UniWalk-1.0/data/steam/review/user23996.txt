Fallout: New Vegas is a very fun free roam, RPG Shooter because the area you explore is intresting, the quest are fun and it feels so satisfying to kill someone with any weapon!The only problems are having to config the game to stop the screen flickering and the random crashes that happen often.other than that You should buy the Ultimate edition of this game when its on sale.
play only for the tf2 hat, this game is boring, dull and not fun at all
A Really Atmospheric FPS with some Horror thrown in to add to the dark, disguisting underwater city called Rapture.this is a shooter you should definitely get if your into dark FPS or just FPS in general
This game still holds up to this day and is also fun to play a bit even if you have the 2nd game, so you should get this game if you want a fun zombie game, even if you own the 2nd one, buy this game for your friends and play together, this is a experince you don't want to miss
