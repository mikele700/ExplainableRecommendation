Played it a couple times. It was alright.
I first started playing this game a while ago and I must say it's come a long way. Seeing all my OP friends makes me want to grind like they did to achieve maximum bada**ery. However it is a grindy game and as a driving game guy not really my type either. That being said I still recommend this game to people considering it, it's free so give it a shot[EDIT]I've played 441 minutes in this session alone.. make it stop..
If you haven't played Payday 2 yet then this is a great place to start. I had a lot of fun with friends when I picked it up on the free weekend that Overkill was doing. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it though as there is a lack of content and only so much replayability. If you can get this and/or Payday 2 on a good sale then I highly recommend it
TL;DR Extremely fun and extremely addicting, I would recommend this game to anyone, no controller required (I personally do much much much better with Keyboard & Mouse)
I sent a ship up to the moon, I ran out of fuel and crashed into it. So I made an even bigger ship and tried again, I landed and crashed but survived, I have no more fuel or electricity. So I sent an even BIGGER Ship to rescue them, I managed to rescue them, but I realized I wouldn't have enough fuel to take them all back, only enough to get into Kerbin's Orbit. So I attatched seats to the same ship and transfered the Kerbals (Creatures living on Kerbin (Earth)) Back to Kerbin, safe and sound. 11/10Bigger ships always win
I picked this up for 99 cents and got my friends some copies too. It was fun while it lasted, be careful who you invite to your sessions because they can make it living hell..
Gotta be all sneaky beaky like.
