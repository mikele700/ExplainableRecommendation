If you ever wanted to kill the world with... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? Well then this is the game for you. Choose your plague, evolve it, and watch as humanity gets destroyed and see how it tries to defend itself from their imminent death. Or you could do it the -passive- way and enslave them with a mind controlling worm, which is personally my favorite plague. Or if you-'re one of those zombie loving people, well we got the plague for you. There is a virus that brings the dead to life. You can decide if you want it to simply destroy humanity with sheer force, or if you want your zombies to become vampires and only drink their blood. You can even bring back the mummified dead. Humanity even nukes the places with zombies in them, United States might even nuke China, or the other way around. I simply recomment this game because it-'s so much fun to play. I might also add that there is going to be multiplayer and diseases from the past like the black death, smallpox and the swine virus. For those who own the mobile version, this is not some kind of scam. You notice that they put a lot of effort into the game and it even includes new things that the mobile version doesn-'t have. Thanks for reading and sorry for these -spoilers.- Have a good day or night, or at whatever time you-'re reading this.
