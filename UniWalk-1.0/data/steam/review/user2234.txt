I use to play this game alot but now it is filled with bugs and character movement fills sloppy.I remeber this game when $30-50 dollars could get you the best sniper, a tiger1 and the best medium tank at the time the Pz4.one big issue i have with this game is audio, there are so many bugs with Audio, in games i dont get any Audio at all tried this on two headsets my Razor Krakon and my older Gamescom headset and it just doesnt work.Also a really big issue is the cost to play, to get up any line now you need to spend atleast $100+, it just seems recently they have become very money hungry since to get a tiger or a Panzer you have to play atleast 100+ hours on that line or spend ridiculous amounts of money since now you have to pay for all the ribbons before the item you want to get and then have to pay for the ingame item as well!!!also (there are lots of other also which i am not going into detail) now they have made playing solo and with friends horrible ingame you cant switch from a F***ing tank crew to a Recon this is BS, and if i want to play with my friend who didnt buy anything when this game turned ♥♥♥♥, well guess what i am stuck with my LMG crew. What the Developers have done is take a Huge S**t on this game and made you pay for itHope this review HelpsFrom Jukia Ninjadont waste your time with this game
