It isn't actually half bad i like it has it's ups and downs although the only down for me is that you can't hear dialog unless it's a cutscene or battle ect but apart from that not too bad for a turn based stratagy kinda reminds me of the old FF still though dialog is smooth and fits pretty well easy to understand decent story and good character designs and an added bonus it's an anime game with a dating sim  in the extras :) ♥♥♥♥ yeah
Decent game pretty much feels like Im Micro Machines which was a great fun game,Although it did get pretty tacky and boring becase there just wasnt much to do 8/10
