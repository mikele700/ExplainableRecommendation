Best elder scrolls to date, however, morrowind is still dear to me, Moz was all content and gameplay no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and thats what i like to see in games.
this is the one game i have found ever, where the hardest difficulty in my opinion makes it easier to play if my word was worth anything i would give it 10/10.
