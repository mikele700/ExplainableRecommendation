Gone Home is very........well, meh. I had a good time with the story but the ending really drags it down, the massive build up to something that could of being explained on the note on the front door (But then we would'nt have a game now would we?).So thanks to that you are forced to do a massive goose chase witht he payoff that just makes your eyes roll.Also this game is not worth 20 dollars. you can eat ♥♥♥♥ and die if you think you can sell this for 20 dollars.I was only stupid enough to miss a book on the second floor so played this game for 20 minutes to long, so now i can't get a refund, ♥♥♥♥.The game is alright in all fairness, but that's it, just alright, nothing more, mabye something less.
