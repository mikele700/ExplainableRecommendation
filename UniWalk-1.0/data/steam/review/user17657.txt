Definately the best DLC out of the ones available, the focus on actual characters instead of the army as a whole was a refreshing break from the rest of the campaigns, the mission were well designed and fun to play, definately recommendThe voice acting, as usual, is pretty terrible, but it can be forgiven
Removed 437 kebabs in 9 minutes10/10 best kebab removal simulator everBut seriously, this is great. Unlockable levels, fun to use power ups and very well done controls. If you are a fan of either kebab removal or on rail shooters (or both), you owe it to yourself to check this one out
Never has a game made me care more about a fictional character
