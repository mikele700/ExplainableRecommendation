As a game ARMA 3  is fundimentallly the same as ARMA 2 with prettier graphics and a better running engine. But as a tool, ARMA 3 has so many better changes over its predacesors, one being it is easier to mod and easier to connect to servers which could be a hassle in earlier games. Do I recommend ARMA 3? Yes when a sale is on I mean it is worth the full 60$ price tag but i know alot of us dont have all the money in the world, getting this game on a sale makes the money for gameplay value that much better you can get 100 hours per cent in the game. pay 1dollar easily 1000 hours of game play. I do exadurate a bit but you get the gist. Pick this game up if you want a difficult but fun Army Simulator
You cant rate a game like this with a score.I reccomend this, but only if you are okay with a depressing game which will probably bring you to tears more often than not
I have been playing guitar for 4 years, now, and it teachs you everything you need, either a new player or long time.Its fun informative and has a great song selection, you are free to download more songs from certain websites and play the songs you grew up with or currently love
What is love, unbelievable, B.O.B, Insane in the brain, Song 2, This is just some of the music in this game, you travel to the 40's and kick some ♥♥♥, how can i not reccomend this game, just go in with an open mind, dont compare this game to the others, and youll have a wonderful time, if you compare then youll still have a good time just thinking more about stuff that you shouldnt be
