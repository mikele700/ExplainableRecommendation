I have a couple of things to say about this game:1. this game is probably not worth playing and i'd rather move on to watching bamboo grow, or my skin to peel away, or my toenails rot2. Honeslty i reckon that the trailor for this game is better than anything else in the actual game.3.Your probably gonna have less lag playing Skyrim on ultra-high graphics on a cheap 1990 Nokia phone then you will playing this on a $10,000 customised, top of the line computer with NASA wifi speeds.Is this game all that bad, Y-E-S. but there is some actually very important stuuf in this for examplethis game helped teach my younger brother how to uninstall a game on steam... Bless you, Jagex <310/10 would rather pay $15 to uninstall this game than to buy it...
