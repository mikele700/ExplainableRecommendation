Dirty Bomb is dirty, very very dirty. :3In all seriousness, this is a very fun, somewhat class based FPS with awesome voice acting for the many mercs you can play as. Currently it has been in beta for a while since I'm sure Splash Damage wants to make this game perfect before calling it a full game (since we have more mercs on the way :) ) Pros:-Diverse Mercs (That means race and gender too)-Large maps that coerce you to have teamwork to the fullest-Fairly well-designed maps with secondary objectives to keep both sides on their toes-Proxy, because she's Proxy :3Cons:-Currently unbalanced games are fairly widespread, though improvements have been made and are continuing to be made-Best played with friends, since bad communication=bad dayI really hope to see what else this game can offer. Hope it can tweak itself to perfection. But the current build is fun too. :3 But its still so dirty.
It's about time that we are given a pc port with ease of control and amazing graphics and fps. ^_^ Finally a game to satisfy my anime genre craves.Pros:-Smooth controls that can be rebound-Amazing art-Good fps, should maintain 60-Light hearted story (At my current playthrough)Neutral:-Breaks the fourth wall quite a bit -Has its fanservice moments (Can be a bit like Ore, TsuintÄ“ru ni Narimasu)-Has many options and features like guilds and events that can be overwhelming or liberatingCons:-Nothing I can really say is bad so far
It's good that I could play a game with such originality and depth at the same time. The game is puzzle-oriented, like life is (hint-hint). What you do with those puzzles is up to you, and you do have the option of negotiation this time. Prepare for very emotional moments, or lack thereof if you are a psycho.
