(sorry for the bad english)      As a gamer who played formerly played World Of Tanks,This game is one of those hidden gems in the world of gaming from your usuall fps games(Counter Strike,Team Fortress 2) i really like it but my rating to this game is its a good game but i want to gave a low rating cause the new 1.37 patch it messed a lot in the tier of playing and the progress just to get a good plane.Because of the new patch im late in the tier of the German aviaton all i have is 3 planes of tier 2 plane and 1 tier 3 plane i was outgunned,outpowerd,outtactic with it so the lost of my interest in German planes For the new who played this may not notice but over the years playing it they will notice how long the time to just to get good plane.       The graphics in this game are unbelieveable with its texture and detail of just the ground its amazing.But after all the need of the Golden Eagle(In-Game Currency)is pretty much very high,im using the British planes who made it to the tier 4 who is always struggling with In-Game Credits. im ending up bankcrupt ,this is what i fear in high tier gaming the need of a higher currency of something premium just play without any loss.      The In-Game matchmaking is one the worst that i would review,The new tier system making a lot of pro players in tier 3 and the new players who just made it to the tier 3 are very unbalanced.Considering myself using Russian tier 3 planes i see this often sometimes i get too good because of the new players that i dont like it because its not challenging enough and a whole of pro players that pretty much dominates every one but some of those pro players are positive hacker because i once  saw a low tier plane(A6MN) just ripped a wing of a well armored bomber(B-25 Mitchell) in seconds of firing it.So the match making system one of worst in War Thunder    Overall:this game is perfect for the players bored with the ordinary First Person Shooter game,a high graphic picture,its more a pay to win game   
One the best games that simulates trench warfare with rigid controls and  few bugs
