Although significantly more 'casual' then the average MOBA, it's the most fun I've had in years when playing the genre. A delightful roster of hilarious characters also makes the game even more of a joy to tuck into. Unfortunatly, some of the Awesomenauts are either over or underpowered, but patches are frequent. So unbalanced gameplay occassionaly happens.8/10 - A top laff
A very fun, moderately challenging platformer which looks absolutly beautiful. It's a stunning looking game, but anyone keen on platformers can tackle this in about an hour. In spite of how short it is, it's certainly worth playing again.
