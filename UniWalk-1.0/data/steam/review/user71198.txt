I sometimes want to hang my self when I see someone unbox a god tier unusual in just a few crates when I've unboxed literally like 600 crates and have received no unusuals.
This game sucks ♥♥♥ there is no killstreak system like on Call Of Duty Ghosts. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I played this game right after playing TF2, my volume was on the max. I leave TF2. I start CS:GO. I was wearing headphones. It blew my eardrums.
