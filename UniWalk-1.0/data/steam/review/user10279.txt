What do you mean this game is only fun with friends? Who do you think I am to have a friends list full of people that want to play games with me? What am I a famous youtuber?But really the game is alright. It runs well and gets updated quite a bit. My only problem is its gets boring after playing it for like 30 minutes even with friends. But other then that its not a bad game even for its price. I can't say if you should or shouldn't buy it, its your choice. I'm just going to vote yes to recommend this game but I mostly stand neutral on this game.
