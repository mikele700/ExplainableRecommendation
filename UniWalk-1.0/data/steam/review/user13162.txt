This is my early review after 3 hours trying how to run this game in Mac OSX 10.10. If you are using Mac, you may also interested with this.What I love and confirmed:+ TONS of player models.+ TONS of maps.+ A server with 15 players.+ Boss fight epic.+ Fast....+ FOV can be set to 180. <3+ A time killing game.What still not yet improve:+ Can only play with lowest graphic setting.+ Keyboard setting can only be changed by using binding console.I would say this game is really worth to play, or at least try it!If you want to try this game out for Mac before developer update, follow this intruction:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=606904804

Well so if you are reading this comment, I guess you already aware of different negative and postive comments. Myself I would recommend this game but strongly warning that the community is toxic (e.g. 12 years old). However it often comes in standard gamemode such as vanilla or normal room, I'm pretty sure most of people there don't feel pleasant with slow action since they have to repeat the same maps again and again. While some other gamemode provide much higher challange but you can be sure that the community is way better there, however they are all tough gamemode for newbie.Pos experience:+ Different gamemode lead to different challange+ Amazing unexpected bug+ Time killingNeg experience:+ Acid community+ Unfair player skill level, some skills are way advantage on a gamemodeSo what I would recommend is the good experience only come through in a certain of time playing, and it will be much difficult to the one who not yet know.
