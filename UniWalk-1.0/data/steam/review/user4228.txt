If you like fun, than you will like this game
Just started to play this game and i love the soundtrack
Dayz has the potential to become one of the best games out on the steam store. The nature of the development progress of the game is so slow and updates only add small amounts of contents and small bug fixs. On the other hand the game is slowly getting better and maybe in 1-2 years time the game may just be worth wait. But for the time being don't buy the game unless you want a game full of bugs. But if you are willing to play the game in a unfair state, it can provide many fun experience playing with strangers and friends.So if you have some money to spare try out the game if you like survival games and zombies.
