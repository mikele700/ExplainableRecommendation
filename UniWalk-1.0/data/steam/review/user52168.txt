Nether this game is so bugged it isent funny but i think thats the charm of it espically with the severs for every continent. Honestly the community is quite a laugh and i find as more of a casual game becasue when you get together with about 3 other freinds or people in a -3rd party program- its just a huge amout of fun and laughter. Any I really enjoy the game hope you do to!!
