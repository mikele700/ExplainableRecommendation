At least we get a free to play ghost recon game
It's like a mix of tf2 and warframe
i regret playing the game. it made me ran out of tears, especially at the ending
this ♥♥♥♥ reminds me of dungeon defenders
Though i didn't see much difference from the original, but it's still the best game out there.
BEST GAME EVER?!
it's a greeeeeaaaaaaaat game, especially when you have the assassin dlc :D
i hate it for not having infinite ammo in this game,but still 10/10
It's a good game,but now the players are collecting stuffs,and it also has a lot of modes :D
