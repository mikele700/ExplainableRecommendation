I do not appreciate being sold an overpriced hyped up pile of ♥♥♥♥ covered in sugar and being told it is delicous cake. well the cake is a lie.
They just don't make JRPG's this good anymore! and backed by an awsome Team to port it over too! i easily recommend this game for anyone who loves the old school games. i rate it shut up and take my money! out of Ten.
I really loved this game,  it was a bit of a downer at the end, but that was because of the choices i made. i loved the art style, it seems the old bit style graphics are the only way developers can get away with such adult themes.  love, sex, murder,suicide and conundrums of morality, if you enjoy roleplaying any of these you will love this game. i wish i had the time to replay this game over and over and discover alternate storylines. this game really made me think after i had finished it about my own moral values and this i rare for a game to effect me at all. also i appluade the option to choose to be a gay or lesbian character, being gay myself it really made me associate with the protagonist and care about the game.
