Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a vast open world for you to explore, dungeons with so much loot you could possible imagine; from your normal Iron armor to Demora armor. You play as a custom character you create, not much different from past Elder Scrolls games. And your on your way to be exicuted in a little imperial town of Helgen, then a dragon attacks and you make a atempt to excape, you get out and the whole world of Skyrim is yours to explore! 10/10 - Ninja Kitty
