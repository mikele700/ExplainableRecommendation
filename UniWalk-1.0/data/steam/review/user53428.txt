This game is amazing! Have played for a while and will continue to play! Every update brings new, fresh content in a unique style of play not found in any other game! The one problem is learning to play the game. The tutorial could use some inprovement, but aside from that the game is flawless! 10/10Side Note: If you are struggling to learn something there is a lot of support provided on the games forums and within the game in various different chat channels.
Clunky movement, lots of Russians and a terrible basis for the game make for an AWFUL time! I played for a quarter of an hour and just couldn't even deal with the lag. (Which by the way, is not due to my computer.) Save yourself some time, DO NOT download this.
