Amazing game, but when ever it changes maps it crashes. very upset that i wasted my money and i cant fix it. help me fix it if you can
10/10 Love Portal 1+2 So Much. The storyline is amazing and it's good to have harder to solve puzzles once and a while. It tests the brain :) But altogether I love the story, the setting and the characters. All Hale GLaDOS!
10/10 Where do I start, This game is just so funny. The story line, the characters. Everything. I'm addicted to Saints Row, I have played the game over and over. Warning, This game is Highly Addictive. I really do hope they make another Saints row game, This game is defently worth the $$
9/10 Love The Arkham Series. It's just got so many twists and turns and A interesting story line. It brings all the favourite bad guys and puts them all in a game. I see it more as a movie than a game but it is very enjoyable. The Third Person view suits the game well, I can't wait for the next game to come out. I'm a big harley Quinn fan :P
10/10 One of the most funniest games I have played. Very enjoyable. Would pay full price (got it on sale)
