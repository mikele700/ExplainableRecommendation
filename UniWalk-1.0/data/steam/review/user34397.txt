I'm having some trouble with this game and I cannot find any answers anywhere. everytime I open the game there is no sound what so ever. could someone please help me
Only played a good one hour or so of this game but I have fallen in love with it. I'm normally not a fan of strategy games but this has blew away all my expectations withing the last 60 minutes. I cannot wait to jump deaper into this game and give it a much more in depth review. I got this in a bundle and it well worth the $15 AUD.
