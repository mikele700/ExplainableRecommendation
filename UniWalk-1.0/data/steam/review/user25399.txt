Valve please give me back my life!!??
Ok, I have a lot of games I really like but haven't reviewed but this game is to excelent to ignore. The story line is enjoy able and the game play is diverse(Like any good stealth game). But the things that make this game stand out is it great art style and because its the only 2D stealth game I know but probalby the best stealth game. And I forgot to mention ITS BOUT F***ING NINJAS!!
