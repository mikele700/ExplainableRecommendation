All I've done in the 21+ hours I've played has ♥♥♥♥ around. This game is so relaxing and fun. Awesome gameplay with a creative engine makes this one of the best games I've played in the last year. And TBH, I usually stay away from open-world sandbox games, but recently they have been very rewarding. If its on sale, buy it. If its not on sale, make sure you still buy it.
