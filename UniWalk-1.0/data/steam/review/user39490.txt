In the festering world of RPGs or gaming in general in which graphics,speedruns that would make Sonic say too fast and unneeded fanservice that would make you grit your teeth in rage rather than entertain you take precedence over everything else, this is what the gaming world needs but not what it deserves. This is my attempt to do a good review and sound not stupid.Characters that are far from stereotypes,supposed accusations of mary-sue that are just actually character devlopment from simply learning from past mistakes(give or take a few tries...) and a world grounded in real world politics and situations while at the same time, a fantastic setting that can keep you entertained and move alongside you.It makes realistic situations part of the charm rather than ditching it like most others,after all there is a good reason why -reality is stranger than fiction- is a saying. If you have the patience to read and immerse yourself in an RPG world that defies the usual cliches that came with the genre, than this game is the one for you.P.S:If the wall of text boxes put you off and make you want to skip in a hurry because you want to save,whenever there is dialog stop thinking that you are playing a game but reading a novel. You will enjoy it much better.
