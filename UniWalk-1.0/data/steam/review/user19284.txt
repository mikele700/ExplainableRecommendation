Should of fixed the ♥♥♥♥ing game before releasing it you ♥♥♥♥ing idiots.
if this game stopped after you got through the first part of the game i would be happy, but it lacked substance after that for me.
As much as i really want to love this game its to broken for me to properly enjoy it. I recommend it when the game is released or close to proper release
This game was incredible and one of my favourites before this Giraffe update came and ruined everything. I am not reccomending this game at this current stage because beign forced to use the matter manipulater every time you want to mine because pickaxes and drills last 5 seconds.Thats some b.s. Until you can mine better and faster without using a ridiculous -repair- system and be able to get your ship up and running without playing a world for 10 years to get 20 cores i will despise one of my favourites. Also what the hell is up with not being able to start a new character with a new world? i have started multiple characters since giraffe and am always! always on the exact same world i just tried to leave behind. Overall Bring back the Koala updates and this game is highly recommended!
