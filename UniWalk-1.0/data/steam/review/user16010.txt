Why the hell am i VAC banned? I don't cheat, srsly valve wtf is your problem?Just remove VAC, steam doesnt even have particularly good games, really doesn't warrant banning a bunch of people for nothing. Legit hackers will be smart enough to not get caught. Plus, tf2? it's basically sandbox. Noone would bother cheating.
