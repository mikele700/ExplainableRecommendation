Exquisite style of combat with a variety of weapons to select from, and an intense atmosphere set by a battle that's always moving, make for an incredibly enticing experience that won't stop being enjoyable. 9.5/10.                                                  Also hats, hats and awesome.
A thrilling RTS game with an original and enticing concept. Defintely a step-up from the first Plague Inc. Would rate it highly for those looking for an inventive and engaging challenge that really gets you to think. Although a captivating simulator with a perplexing amount of appeal, It's still more suited to a Casual category, and is not the ideal choice for those who enjoy taking up lots of time in games. Would still rate 8.5/10
