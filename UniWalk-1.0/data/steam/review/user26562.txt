ok game but could be better
Best game ever cool concept quite a contender for DayZ and Nether. When in a server you must be careful who you trust....a good 78% (or so) of players are KOS (Kill On Sight) but every once in a while you run across some nice people to play with.Great building ideas but would like to see mare varryation in what u can build cool durability system BUT EVERYTHING runs out TOO FAST please nerf that Apart from that on e of the best games i have ever played!
Bought this today tried to play dayz get message global banned UMM WTF I JUST BOUGHT THIS!!!! IM TAKING THESE ♥♥♥♥ERS TO CORT!
Freakin trerrible Overdramatic/over sensitive crashesCant steer left or right while brakingunnesessary Delay for auto reverse and rentering first gear *makes game unplayable those extra 10 seconds <--- wish i was joking mean the diff between winning and losing. 1.2/10Graphic wise its -OK- with the expansions.Again many more issues you can see for yourself.Number Rating: 1.2/10 Worded Rating: Bull-Sh it
