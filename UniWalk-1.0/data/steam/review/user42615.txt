Amazing game, vvery funny and enjoyable. Highly recomended.
This game is wrongly accused of being pay-to-win. This is a pay-to-progress title, and the devs are workgin on making it less and less so. By reducing the bonuses of being a premium member, they have decreased the in game money gain so everyone needs to farm. There is no reason to get mad when people pay up to $100 for a tank in a video game, it's their moeny and their choice. If this game was pay-to-win, then there would be things that only premium members can access that normal members can't. There are only 2 things that a premium member can access that a F2P member cant. Those are the extra inventory slots for your weapons, which is useless as you can only tkae a maximum of 3 weapons anyway as you cant carry too much weight. The second is an extra combat badge slot, to those who dont know what that is, you can equip 1 badge if F2P and 2 if you are a premium member, these give you small bonuses which dont affect the tide of battle. In saying that, they hardly affect a single soldiers gameplay that much, and can be countered easily with skill. All in all, don't be disgruntled by all the negative reviews from people whining about the game being pay-to-win because its really not. If you feel like you need a game to pass some time then give this a go and make your own call but dont review it after 60 hrs... Happy to answer any questions or disscuss with anyone about this game on any topic, add me for info and thank you for reading. ENJOY THE GAME
