ok after finally getting in last night i died from starvation 3 times. they need to up the loot a bit more for everyone is dieing. it is quite funny but also annoying if you actually want to progress. i love th ecombat system makes you feel like you can actually survive one on one with a zombie. after i found a axe my life became easier i was cutting trees making campfires and cooking  up poor bambi in no time at all and purifying my water made it feel like a sense of achievement.i recommend this game on the basis i know it is alpha and will keep on improving.
