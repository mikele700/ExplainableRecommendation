9/10 would hang my ♥♥♥♥♥ out in public again
Highly recomend this game. fun for days and good to play in a group its not really a horror like its stated but its a good survival game. although its very buggy in the games current state keep in mind it is in alpha. it has alot of potensial in my opinion 8/10
