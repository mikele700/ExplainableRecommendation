I've played the beta of this game and this is no different. Although there is some skill involved, it still feels like a pay to win because when you get passed beginner level you are more likely to rage quit all the time with pros out gunning you with better armour and weapons. However it looks beautiful and brings a different genre of shooters on the market. Just hoped they would make more maps in the future but you'll still look like a badass in this game.
