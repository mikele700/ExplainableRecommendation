At first, I had fallen to the bitter end of mass raiding enemy troops. Now that I have learnt the controls, I started to create garrisons as a combine and increased the number of stalkers. I thought that I needed something more. Something to make the game full.Then I found it. Garrisons were my source for tomato sauce on the battlefield. There were so many metro police that I decided that there was not enough. When I finally decided my troops were ready, I sent them out to my battlefield. At this stage I was getting 6 FPS.Even if it was lagging, I decided to push on. The enemies did not stand a chance.But then something else did not stand a chance against the plethora of metro police I had sent forth. The game itself. I found this amusing and for a mod for an RTS within the source engine, it was extremely well done.
