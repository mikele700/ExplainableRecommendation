The graphics are good. The sound is good. The gameplay is good. Everything is good. If you say otherwise you are going to be shot by Kaiser.
Update 100 update of an update of a review: They finally listened. Finally no more drills. New skills update. Looking pretty good there OVK, just don't screw this up with the Safehouse customization or anything else.As of 15.10.2015 PAYDAY 2 has been renamed PAY2WINDAY 2 or P2W: The Game. I seriously loved this game, spent 2,000 hours on it, and now came the greed, the microtransactions. They ruined the game (well it was ruined before, however still good enough to play), you can call those microtransactions as The Final Nail In the Coffin of PAYDAY 2 and the Crimefest 2015 as PAYDAY 2's Funeral. Don't buy this game, it is no longer a good game. Score: -∞/∞.P.S. Microtransactions are the spawn of Satan, they are awful. I get the idea if this was a F2P game, still would ♥♥♥♥ me off, but the developer has to make some money off of it. But for a paid game: ♥♥♥♥ NO!!!!!P.P.S RIP PAYDAY 2, PAYDAY 2's modding community, PAYDAY 2 players. OVERKILL you should be ashamed of yourself of not only ruining a good game and killing your own company but also of your flat out stealing from other games. Shame on you OVERKILL, shame on you.Update 1: Since 25.10.2015's AMA I think that OVERKILL just completly forgot about their community and just straight out said ♥♥♥♥ YOU! to us. Well ♥♥♥♥ YOU! OVERKILL cause I am done with you, hope you have the same faith as GRIN.
Graphics look the same as on CS:S. Sound is the same. Gameplay is broken, the bullets go up (physics? who needs physics). Bots are the dumbest in the whole series. And than there is the greatest microtransactions ever. For only 300€ you can have a skin for a knife. How about you take that knife and shove it up your ♥♥♥. Generally not a good game, threw itself off of the CS originality.
