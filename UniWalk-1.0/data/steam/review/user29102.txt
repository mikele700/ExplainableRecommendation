I really love this game but i fixed the gravity postion stabilizer in my lifepod and it just keeps drifting. This was not an issue before the 2016may update and now i have no idea where my base is. :(
As someone who has been playing all the Fallout games since 1998, This one is by far the best FPS one but simultaneously the worst RPG one (disregarding Fallout: Brotherhood, we don't talk about that one), so it has kind of (or started) to move away from what makes Fallout exceptional, originally.Fusion cores are annoying and go against the lore, preston even more annoying.Didn't live up the games hype, still good though.I rate it, Fallout 2 > Fallout New Vegas > Fallout > Fallout 4 > Fallout 3
