Love it! This game is just so fun to play, w/ friends or online. The only downside is the lack of community, so get out your wallets and buy this game, and recommend it to all your friends and help the community grow! +1
This game is one of my favourite co-op puzzle games. It is one of those games that challenge you, and make you enjoy every second of the game.
