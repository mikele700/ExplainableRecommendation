this game is fun to play but is very pay to win
This is the game that killed one of the best strategy game series of all time
Space Engineers is a very fun game with little to no bugs and alot of gameplay. i am always finding new cool things to do and they are adding new thing all the time.
don't buy this game. played it at alpha lots of bugs. i now play it and i crashes for me and my frends all the time!this game would be fun if it worked,  but it does not.
so many things to do, fun gameplay. if you like RTS games this is the game for you.
one of the best 2D games i have ever played, i play it every day. it is one of thoughs games you can just pick up and play.
