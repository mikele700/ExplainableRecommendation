I love this game! It is one of those game that is easy to play but hard to master. The game goes on forever but in terms of actual story it is rather short as you only get 35 years. However, with that in mind, this game is easy to pick up, fun to play, and very casual. Overall a good little simulation although not very realistic but that is the beauty of it. I rate this 9/10.
Spec Ops: The Line is actually pretty fun to play. It is not as hyped as other games but it is definitely worth playing. This game is a unique third-person shooter that is unlike any before it. The story is well written and from time to time the players will have to make moral choices that will affect how the story plays out and how your team feels towards you. The multiplayer is a bit of a letdown only because of the fact that there is hardly anyone online as no one really plays this underrated game. However, there is an option for co-op so in that regards if you have friends with this game, you will always have someone to play with and complete the story together. Overall I give it 8/10.
Haven't play much only because I have exams coming up but from what I've played I can already say that this is one of the best games I've ever played. The first thing that got me was how beautiful the graphics are. It is truly a work of art. The gameplay too is magnificent. Absolutely amazing. I recommend this to everyone. Buy it now!!
