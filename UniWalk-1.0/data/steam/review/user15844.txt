The Best, the story in single player is really good. Multiplayer..... just add me and ask me if you want to play multiplayer
pay to win
Totally not worth it for 10 bucks... Third person view in this dlc mission only
No-one play multiplayer, graphics is so bad, AI broken, mission got problem (because AI sometimes wount move) and many more!
Its a good game even with unbalance match you still having fun playing it.
just do it
