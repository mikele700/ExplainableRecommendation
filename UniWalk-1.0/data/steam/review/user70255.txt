If you like the steampunk genre, this game is definitely for you! If you like waiting, dealing with the inadequacies of your teammates, a clunky interface, terrible customization options, AI that wanders around aimlessly, and matchmaking system that leaves random assignment to be desired, then this game is super definitely for you!!!
