DC Universeâ„¢ Online is basicly a game were u can play as a hero or a villan both side's are slightly different but in my opinion the vilans are better because it's just a bit easyer to play as the bad guys but moving on. u get to customize a character and if u dont like the way a pieace equpment looks like but u like the stats of it there is 2 tab's in the menu, invintory and looks u can equip the stuff you like and still look how you want at the same time. but if you want to use full customization u have to buy some stuff first but u still have access to most stuff wile customizing a hero/villan. so i reccomend playing this game even if your a marvel fan play this game
y dont i have the armors
