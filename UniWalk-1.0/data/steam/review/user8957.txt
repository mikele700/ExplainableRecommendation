Finished playing through it on normal and maybe soon play it on the hardest difficulty, but heres my report:Loved it, loved every minute of it. The Artwork is amazing and the voice actors did an amazing job, nearly cried at one point, not because of the plot, but because the voices actors said it so amazingly it was beautiful.the plot is suprizing and the Ending has left me wanting more Dust!i give it a 9/10the only bad thing i can say is the combat system is very repetative. But besides that minor detail, i still will be coming back for more. :)
Ive played over 7 play throughs on multiple consoles and still havnt gotten bored of this game, though the issue i find in this game is minor (The Zooming) i still find the story, the enviroment and the npcs are just amazing. worth every dollar and every hour spent.
by far, one of the best games ive played.
