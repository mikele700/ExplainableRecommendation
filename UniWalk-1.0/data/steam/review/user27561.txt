All this game taught me is that hitting animals while they are down is super okay. What a mysterious game. However so far this game has great environments and isn't scary, but tense and kinda spooky.
Few games live up to childhood memories, this is one of them. This game was a fun as I remember it, worth a purchase if you have played any of the fables. Because this is by far the best.
One of the laziest games I have played, you repeat the same thing and get a little closer each time. Dissapointing considering Alan Wake was alot of fun. Don't bother.
A fantastic game with a great list of songs, got me playing guitar again! Brilliant for any level of guitar player.
Potentially spoilers, sorry.I feel as if Coda isn't a person, as narrator already feels bad for showing his work, but then goes ahead and sells it? It just doesn't feel real.  However this game has a great, deep narrative.
