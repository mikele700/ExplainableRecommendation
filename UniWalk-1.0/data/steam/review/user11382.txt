This game is really one of a kind, and one of the best games I have played. I was really blown away with how well it played with my emotions because of the incredible story. The characters just have so much... character, which really makes this game amazing to me, along with this the music just adds so much to the story and has the ability to make you feel happy one minute and sad the next. I would recommend this game to anyone, it really is just amazing and I can't think of anything bad to say about it.
