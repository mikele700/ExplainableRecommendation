Apart for some setbacks due to my amd graphics card, (so many crashes, but solved by disabling catalyst AI), and audio issues (probably driver related, a reinstall fixed it) that i have sorted out, it is a great game that really just fits in well with the doom franchise. Fast paced, shotgun in your face, looking for secrets, and the story.. well who cares! Its doom!
This is not a game for beginners and kids, if you are a real man u will love this game. Paradox has done it again and i give it my highest rating. Best game from best the developer.
