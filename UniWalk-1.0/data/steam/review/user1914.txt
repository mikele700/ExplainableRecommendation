While I don-'t play it anymore, Team Fortress 2 is an amazing game. It-'s fun and has a surprising amount of backstory with the comics and -Meet The- videos. Every class feels different and is well balanced (Can-'t say the same for some items, though) and the modding community makes the game even greater by adding new content such as skins, new gamemodes and new models. Team Fortress 2 is a game that everyone should try out and play with friends.4/5
