The game is really good but when you are in the game for some time most of the terrain gets destroys making it harder to play and sneak around which also leads you to fall down holes, also when you snipe it makes a laser when you scope.The game however is very creative and allows you to create your own maps which is very hard but also fun because you can then make it together with your friends.
