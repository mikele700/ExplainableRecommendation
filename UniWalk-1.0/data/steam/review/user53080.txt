every time i get on a match like a noob i hear screaming and lots of- KILLL EVERYTHING BANG BANG GRENADE FLASHBANG  YOU NOOB and i'm dead i like it :D 10/10
this is an decent game only if i could play a match! i have wasted 48 mins of my life trying to get on a match beacuse it just loads the ? for 20 mins or if i get in a game after 10 seconds everyone freezes and i'm left by myself wondering the map then getting off. this would have been a enjoyable only if it was not so glitchy. to sum it up never got in a match, sometimes the match does not even load and it freezes all the time 0/10
i just got this game yesterday and i all ready have 12 hours into this game, dont think of buying it just buy it already!how i started the game-get into heist-finishes easy one and is full of pride-has little to no money-tries to stealth with other people-fails-they leave me and im left alone-cries-cries agian-finds random hard mission-finishes mission and gets $1,000,000-buys one gun and one mod and is left broke-can only find exp and money in the cards-still broke:D luv it 420/10
