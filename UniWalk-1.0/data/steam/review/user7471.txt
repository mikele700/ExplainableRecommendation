Killing Floor seems to be in a style that isn't seen to often in the gaming industry, as a true Survival Horror co-op game. Unlike other sorts of these games, such as Left 4 Dead for instance, this game does not follow as storyline at all. You spawn into the level, and you either survive or die. 6 different classes to experiment with: Sharpshooter, Support, Berserker, Demolition, Firebug and Medic, means you'll definitely find your preferred play style A great game, constantly being updated by its developers, (it does seasonal cosmetic changes in game, which are always fun), made even more enjoyable when played with friends.
