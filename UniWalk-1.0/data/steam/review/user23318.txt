This game is great. Action packed, Indepence and a great plane simulator. You have freeness to drive around, and do test flights. highly realistic. And, its free. CMON PEOPLE! btw, 9.8/10.
I have to say, the game is great. Although the game isnt fully developed (which means there will be some bugs) this game has great gameplay and the visuals are stunning. The combat style isnt like any old-fashioned call of duty, it is rather hunker down and try not to get sniped, whilst clearing out trenches. The maps are well done and add alot of character to the game. I really love how the central and entente powers have their own sub-classes, it adds alot of variety to the game.9/10
