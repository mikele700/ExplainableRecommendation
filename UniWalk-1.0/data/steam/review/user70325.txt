The binding of Isaac is a rogue like shooter based on the randomly generated dungeon crawling structureThis game is amazing. Most of the people complaining probably just sucked at it. At first, I did too, but I was hooked. The story is much deeper than it seems and the game play itself is wonderful, but tedious. I do admit that it's frustrating when you find items you'd rather not put up with like the lemon mishap, but nothing feels better than showing up to the final boss room way overpowered and unlocking new items before starting again.
