Horrible optimisation. I can run every game in my library on 60fps on max settings. Except this one. This game is literally unplayable. I want a refund.
How to make DayZ better1. Please for the love of god let us spawn with friends on the coast. There is nothing more annoying than spending an hour looking for your firends. Absolutely ridiculous.2. Optimisation of the game is terrrible, 80 fps in the country which dips to 25 in cities? What the hell? 3. Combat with zombies sucks ♥♥♥. Using a melee weapon, the shots dont ffel like they connect at all, when as a zombie game that is one of the most important things. 4. No random events to keep you going, there should be hordes of zombies roaming around. 5. LET US SPAWN WITH FRIENDS RUNNING AROUND FOR AN HOUR LOOKING FOR THEM IS NOT FUN
Fix stealth. A guard walked through a closed bookcase. Still no 7 day heists. Still no safehouse customization. You only ever play two missions, which gets very,very boring very quickly. They keep adding heists but they all give ♥♥♥♥ all cash and xp so there is no point in doing them. Fix your damn game.
