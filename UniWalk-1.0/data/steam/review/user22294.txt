I cant say much for this game with such small hours but coming from never heard or played thief before hand i was quite intrigued to give this a shot not knowing what lied in store for me. i can duely say that this game has showed me a incredible amount of detail and depth to its story from the smallest of expriences to the larger picture its quirkey yet amazing and how real it makes us look into ourselves on how we act in real life and what decisions and for what our own fate entails to us. this game was a real eye opener for me and i loved im not a [/spoiler horror fan but this jumped me a bit but i stuck to it]. its an amazing surely a must have if somone wants to go Out-of-box/ mainstream game. toss a coin and give it a shot like i did it wont disapoint. loving it so far intend of finishing it
