This game just sends me back to my when I was a child and played this on my brothers computer. This game is solid, its fun, its challenging and it requires superior teamwork to win the game. I would definitely recommend this game to anybody.
An extremely fun game that leaves me wanting to play it again, again and AGAIN. It makes me want to do a ghost run, no kills or kill every enemy. In short, if you find this game, get it, it was worth every single dollar of the 50$ i spent on this game.
