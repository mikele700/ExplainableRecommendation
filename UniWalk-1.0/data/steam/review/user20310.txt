Robocraft is a rediculously fun game that allows alot of creativity and freedom due to not so recent updates. When these updates came out, I was allready max level so I automaticly unlocked every component. I think tht it is a good chalenging game that actually invovles alot of dicision making, like what to build how to build it, should I scrap this bot and all that kind of fun shinanagins. Anyway, I think that robocraft is a really good fre2play game that has a lot of really cool features and is just a really cool game in general.
