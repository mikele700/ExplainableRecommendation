If you enjoy a FPS zombie game, this one will work for you. Not as good as the more popular games such as left 4 dead 2, but it serves well for those who wants to play a similar game but can't afford it. Great game, loads of blood. loads of fun. 7/10. :)
Essential to anyone who owns steam. It takes a while to download but it's worth it. So many differnt options. A great comical fps that deserves a solid 8/10. Storyline isn't obvious but the great this is discovering the origins of the Characters.
Great sandbox. Just for messing around and the gamemodes are addicting. I give it a 8/10. It just lacks story. (There is none) but we can cut it some slack just because it's a sandbox game.
