this game has potential and all im gonna say is that it needs a lot of work
it needs a lot of improvement and needs a better translation that doesnt use Google Translate or what ever they used and it shouldnt show both languages at the same time and instead make an option to choose between them and other than that i guess its fine consering this is based of STALKER
6/10it could improve
i have played this game a lot on the ps3 in here just like 5 hours because my pc couldnt handle it before but this is a game that you have to spend youre time on to get somewhere and most gamers dont like that and thoose are the kind of gamers that say that a game is horrible because its not easy to win and to be honest they are wrong and they arent true gamers because the fact that old games where really hard to win makes this game easy to be honest this game isnt easy and its a little hard to play but this game is easy compared to an good old hard game and i would recommend this game to anybody who likes games with multiplayer and a long storyline
its bad for a normal game but for an unity game its not that bad
its a very decent game
its a decent game
