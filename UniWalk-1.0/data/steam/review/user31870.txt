This game.... is amazing.It has all of my favourite RPG characteristics; Extensive character creation, unique experiences, story-changing choices and much much more. It also has more realistic parts, for example: marriage (both heterosexual and homosexual), granted Bethesda copped some flack for Oblivion-'s heterosexual-only marriage, but it is still good to see homosexual marriage in the game.One of my favourite aspects of this game, is the fact that everyone has their own unique experience. Both me and my friend can talk about Skyrim all day and we willl always have different experiences.There are two minor (and clich√©) problems that I have with Skyrim: 1)  It has no multiplayer; Skyrim would be even better if it had multiplayer. To quote M-'aiq the Liar (Main easter-egg guy) : 'Some like taking friends on adventures. M-'aiq thinks being alone is better. Less arguing about splitting treasure.-  But none the less, I can live without multiplayer.2) As Skyrim is a huge open-world game, it has a little more bugs than any other game. But those can be fixed (usually).If you are considering buying this game, then buy it. It is (in my opinion) one of the most immersive, fascinating and addictive games ever. I spent all Summer playing this game. So I recommend this RPG to anyone.~DarthHaydo1
