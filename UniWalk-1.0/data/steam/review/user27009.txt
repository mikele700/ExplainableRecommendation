First time playing the game, these exact words came out of my mouth -Where the F*** AM I?-Then i met a man who only had pants and told me a command (F1) that allowed me to see everything (censor.nudity false). We lived together as happy naked men, sticking our beloved rock up each others ♥♥♥♥ cracks, it was the most fun ive had in a game..soo realistic. A rule to remember: Don-'t trust anyone! this game can bring the worst out of people and people say words that shouldnt be said such as #GetRekt, Your a C***, F*** you, Give my F***ing Rock back, Take your pants off, bend down...all i can say to this is welcome to the world of rust, have fun and rage.
