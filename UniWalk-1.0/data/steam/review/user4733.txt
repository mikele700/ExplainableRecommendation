A great game and with further development will become probably one of my most played games on steam, look forward to what the team at Eleon studios can do with it, and I can't wait for them to make it better ^^Still a bit buggy in its early alpha format, would give it an 8/10 in its current format, but as the game progresses this is sure to improve :)
Such a great game 10/10
Very promising, can't wait for more updates :)
