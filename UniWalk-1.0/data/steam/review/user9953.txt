This game is really good the only down side is that the game is not finished yet.Recommend having good headphones or speakers at a high volume.
10/10 Wish I could go higher great game for you and your friends. Great game to find friends to play online with. Great game for pretty much everything I think I have round 800 or so hours so take that as you may. But definitely worth the money $10 seems like a rip off to valve actually.
