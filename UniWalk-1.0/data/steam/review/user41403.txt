The fantastic thing about Ultimate Chicken Horse is that you don't even have to be good at it in order for it to be hilarious fun. If you have even one friend to play with in local multiplayer (I can only recommend local multiplayer since that's been my only experience so far with the game) and you can both laugh at your own absurd (and no-doubt plentiful) virtual demises, then this is a game you owe it to yourself to at least try (don't forget - you can refund any game for any reason if you've owned it for under 2 weeks and played under 2 hours!).I already feel that I've had my money's worth from this game, and those I've played with fully agree. My fellow players and I have discussed the game and we agree heartily on its quality.Ultimate Chicken Horse...is accessible to gamers of most skill levels (some basic platforming experience helps).is thoroughly amusing, light-hearted and fun (or, hey, you could play it seriously, hold a tournament! It's very flexible!)plays smoothly.employs simple controls.is quick to learn.features some surprising depth and creativity in combining objects and game mechanics (the 'honey,' especially in combination with moving objects, is my favourite part of the game).has an enjoyable and fitting soundtrack.contains only a few minor issues which only occasionally detract from the experience.has a cute style of animation and cute voices for all the playable animals.features a simple, well-paced progression system, with the important parts (new levels and characters) unlocking early, and the fun little bits (clothes/accessories) unlocking later.uses a clear-cut and simple scoring system that requires little explanation, if any, as most of it can be understood simply by learning through play.can be enjoyable even for less-experienced players - if you're not hung up on the goal of winning and just like having fun, it doesn't matter if you don't often come out on top! Watching others yelp and holler as they navigate a devious stage is half the fun.is thoroughly spectator-friendly.should probably be in your Steam library by now.
Only played a few hours, partly solo, partly with my brother and a friend. Already got my money's worth. I imagine it will be quite some time before another game captures the spirit of giant-robot-battles-in-space anime as well as this one has.
