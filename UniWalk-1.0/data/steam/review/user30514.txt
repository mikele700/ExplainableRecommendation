I wish I could provide a more externsive review of the game, however it kepy crashing in the Prologue. The fact that I couldn't save the game, meant I had to replay it many times, only to enjoy more crashes and begin again. That aside, the camera controls were awkward and controlling your hero was pretty annoying. The fact that your heroes auto-used skills and spells felt like there was little need for me to control anyone, and that I was simply there to (try) and tell them where to move, and let them do the rest (which they were more than capable of dealing without me).I asked for a refund on this one, simply because of the controls and constant crashes. Unless the community builds some impressive content after the game is heavily patched, I'd not recommend.
