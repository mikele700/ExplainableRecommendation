Welp here is my kinda quick who gives a damn about spelling review on the crew, Even though everyone gave this game ♥♥♥♥ before it had even come out due to ubisoft and how they are but This is coming from someone who is max level and finished the story,Pros- The game looks really nice,cars are very nice to look at and sound very nice, the map feels very large and has lots of different terrain and weather which does effect the handling which is good. The story is rather enjoyable for a racing game and it is an adult level story not some dumbed down kids friendly story that makes me want to cry (Test Drive 2 im looking at you), The cars handle well for what they are and upgrading does actually make the cars feel better to drive.Cons- (ohboiherewego.jpg) Welp this game does have its fair share of cons so far. The whole name of the game is the crew, which is funny conisdering me and my friends cant join each others crews, and the fact most of the time you are playing you never see anyone else driving around, and teleporting to friends to see them doesnt help because they never show up on your screen. Another con would be the huge lack of support with these problems and how none of the devs seems to care about the connections problems (Which isnt good considering this game is apparently an mmo, and an mmo with connection issues isnt a good thing). The last few cons would be gameplay based, the other ai racers in this game are either so stupid they drive into rivers or they are so rediculously op that they cant be caught even by the best of drivers in the best of cars, and the last con would be im having a problem where the game seems to take control of the car and ♥♥♥♥ you up at the worst of times.Final thought: Even with this extensive amount of cons i would still reccommend this game as the majority of these cons will be fixed within the next few days (hopefully) and the game is rather enjoyable otherwise.
