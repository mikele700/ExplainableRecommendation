This is an excellent survival horror game, as it manages to keep a suspensful atmosphere throughout your experience and manages to create a very realistic post-apocalyptic city, by uitilizing the use of shrubbery, broken building, crashed helicopters, masses of derelict, weather damaged cars as well as, of course, the players, who mostly seem to be very paranoid towards eachother as well as very distrustful. This greatly helps to create a tense and frightening atmosphere in which the players survive. And one final thing, the nether (of course). They are not only scary as crap in appearance but they can also teleport and are extremely powerful depending on the variety -speaking of which, there are many-. All of these assets greatly help to create a great survival horror experience for the nether game. PS: it is still in alpha, so there will be a few bugs.
