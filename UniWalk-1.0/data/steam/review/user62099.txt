The game is the same as the origonal realease, except with so many little bugs added in that it is truely infuriating trying to play. I really enjoyed Age Of Mythology so when I saw this I was rather excited, I expected it to be at least a slight improvement and was thouroughly dissapointed. I am glad I purchased this while it was on sale,  because I do not believe it is worth the full price. I regret paying even the $10 that I did.Please save yourself the time and money and just do not buy this. It is not worth it.
