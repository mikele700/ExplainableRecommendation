This is by far one of the greatest games of all time. Thats including the few minor bugs jere and there. Don't expect any game to be perfect but Fallout 4 is near that. Base Building, great storyline, amazing exploring (if you get this game make sure you explore the bottom right about level 20, amazing loot down there) if u loved NV, loved F3 and loved skyrim then your sure as ♥♥♥♥ gonna love this game. Its also very ♥♥♥♥ing addictive so watch out. If your on exam break i recommend waiting until after exams to download the game because once you start you cant stop. I would give this game 11/10 ign. Also u can ♥♥♥♥ your companion.
