This is a really good game. There are many Multiplayer modes you can play Such as DeathMatch, Arms Race, Demolition, Casual and Compettive. DeathMatch is alot of fun and can be played when you don't have much time but want to have some fun. Arms Race is a fast paced game. It can be alot of fun. Compettive is alot of fun and I really like the way it work. You have to buy your wepons at the begining of the Round. Rounds go about 4 min I would say and there are 30 Rounds in a Game. The game looks really good and its also very cheap. I recommend this game to everyone.
This is a really simple game but alot of fun. You can have hours of fun with this game and best of all it is cheap. If you want to have some fun for awhile you should buy this game.
