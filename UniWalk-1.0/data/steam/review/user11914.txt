just ruins the game for example heres one of the issues this unrefined dlc has brought. If you want to play as an ethnic minority like the dutch stuck in west francia and you want to break out before the patch/xpac you could just focus on finance and save alot of money to buy a mercenary army that take them down while they are weak.however with the new fleeing system and how hard is it to chase through francia with all the provinces being so small you will beat them in a battle but get much less victory points and they will be able to flee much further and if u catch up to them while they are fleeing you cant fight them which is absolute bs and just unfair nonsense. tldr some people like playing as the dutch and u made that harder paradox.
Was really keen for this as i played mk9 back in the day but wasnt able to own it cos mk is r18 in aus.when i got this i played the story mode and enjoyed and i liked some of the additonal moves u can swap out with the characters.namely the cool new stuff ermac can do.unforutnately thats where the positivity stops.The online is freakin unplayable not matter how good ur net is,the game is soooo badly optimized im using an alienware with a good processor and 32 gigs of ram and a 2gb graphics card and this game lags like ♥♥♥♥ where as skyrim on ultra high or dark souls 2 on max settings is fine.Seriously bad optimization for a fighting game.most dissapointing thing is no online cos i was keen on that
still in early access asnd needs mods that inscrease gathering by 10X and speed up taming otherwise the game is way 2 slow wudnt buy until the game gets fixed as also most servers are laggy.the game itself ona modded server where the biggest problems are fixed hwoever is a blast
Spawned on a beach took a gander around noticed a hideous fat man of in the distance running at me with a club get wreckt by the fat man . 10/10 wud buy the game to get killed by a fat man at the start again.
Based on the first 2 hours of the game i would give it a 7.5/10 good game but I feel like the polish/time needed for this game to be great just wasnt there  the very first cutscene for the campaign is very poorly done and looks rushed after that though the gameplay was actually quite fun.
