Abosultly amazing game and well worth the money for all the DLC's and I recomend it to people who need a change to the old school tower defense plus its multiplayer so if you want to kill stuff with a mate you can :DGreat looking game, story line is easy to follow and just a brilliant game overall. 10/10
