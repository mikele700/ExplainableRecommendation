Best Carbage Digging Simulator Ever!
Alrighty,this game looks totally sick,i saw many videos on how to play,my frwnds playing ths ect.But now that i bought it on steam i have many sort of issues with the launcher,i can-'t even launch the game.So can i ask one of you guys to aid me with this. As soon as i log in everything run as it should,connecting to servers contacting steam servers,but then it says this messag:-Would you like to link your Steam account to your Mber account? This is required if you bought your game via Steam.-I click yes,and what happens?it is literally en infinite loop and it repeats with taht message the whole time and that leads me to not launching the game.PLS PLS PLS help me with this problem,i will be very grateful if 1 of u can help me.
Still a better love story than Twilight... 10/10 would never let it go again.
