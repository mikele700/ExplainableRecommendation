I love this game because of its beautiful design and structure, it seems so satisfying when you kill an enemy and he explodes into parts: here are my first 5 mins of the game:-spawn in-rek tony-get my crap together-die to a guy who just decides to be an ***hole by blocking the shop-spawn in and try to kill him-die again-close game-starts new game-repeat step one downBut jokes aside I have a suggestion for this game:MAKE IT FREAKEN MULTIPLAYER GOD DAMNIT
