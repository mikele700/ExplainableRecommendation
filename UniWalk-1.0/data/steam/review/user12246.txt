Can you guys please add a way to delete worlds? Please. i have a metric crap ton of worlds and i dont want to keep them all. And i dont want to re-install the game just to delete all my worlds otherwise i lose all my progress. Please just add a delete world button.
it keeps crashing. i dont know why but it does so i cant recommend this game but for the time i did get to play ( Couple of minutes like 10-20 minutes) i cant dislike it so im not sure. so i will just recommend it.
Ok so this is really good. I have been playing this for a while and it is like free less content version of Gran Turismo. Really fun. Controlls are a bit wierd but you can manually change them yourself. other then that it has good potential.LIKE!
Its ok i guess. it could just go on a website or something. but i like the fact it is on steam. Also i dont know why i cant get lemons anymore. they stop produceing!Sounds wierd but its true.Overall good game.
very good game. um but there is a problem. i have been able to play it for ages and now im trying to play it again but it says there is a problem with the launcher. please help i have paid for this game and if i cant play it i am going to be pretty mad. over all good game.
BEST GAME EVER!If you like childish but still adult to basically any aged games and you like -SHOOTING- people...then this game is for you.
This game is kinda pointless. its still fun to see whats inside guns. And this is kind of educational.I pretty much recommend this if you want to learn what makes guns work!
