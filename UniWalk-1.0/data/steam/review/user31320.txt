Firewatch was an unexpecting, joy of a game to play. I normally don't enjoy games of this genre but it easily gave me a real feeling of connection towards the characters and storyline. I throughly enjoyed it and don't personally feel deceived or frustrated by the ending that many felt lackluster about. The voiceacting and writing was top notch, I look forward to this game winning many awards for these categories.I'd read bits and pieces of this game prior to launch and thought of buying it simply on it's artistic basics. This game is gorgeous and is throughly enjoyable to walk around. The art style is really spectacular, it really had a 'Up!' feel about it in terms of it's design and cartoonish-like aesthetic detail.I feel like I need to see people in my life play this, to hope they will understand what this game means to me.This game will be in my Top 10 games of 2016, hell, I feel like this game will be in my top 10 in my lifetime.I really really like this game and if you are the person who enjoys narrative driven games that could be completed in one-sit through of roughly 3-4 hours. I would highly recommend this game. Just, go buy it now.
This game is just terrible, if you have $10, please spend it on something else.
