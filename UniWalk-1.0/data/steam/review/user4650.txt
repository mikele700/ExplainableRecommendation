Great top down game, easy to play as you can figure everything out as you go. A simple yet engaging and fun experience with few biomes, many items, plenty of building materials and great mobs. Good value for it's price, the game is reasonable however probably needs quite a few more things still.The developer works hard on updates every day and regularly does things to the game which is always a good sign. You can find the official wiki of the game here!
