A fantastic RPG with an unparalleled sense of progression, well developed combat system, and a world that feels truly lived in. The controls take some getting used to but with a bit of effort soon become second nature. It may be dated graphically with blocky models and stiff animations but surprisingly the texture work is very good and in some places even outshines some modern games (which is depressing - get your ♥♥♥♥ together developers). I recommend playing Gothic 1 before 2 because the second game builds heavily upon the characters, story and setting from the first game and certain parts from 2 will feel more rewarding after having finished Gothic. Having played both games for the first time in the year of our lord 2013 I can say without the slightest trace of nostalgia that Gothic 1 & 2 ranks high amongst the finest of western RPGs.
