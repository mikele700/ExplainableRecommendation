reccommend if you have a good internet connection and good temperI live in Australia and because I play at odd times I tend to see the same people quite often. late at night it seems there are some people who use smurf accounts and just aim to get teammates banned. I am now on a one week cooldown because of 2 disconnects one because it's Australia and the other was a dc followed by a forced update the other two bans come from a group of two smurfs who get a bunch of kills and then try their hardest to get killed (jumping in front of awps and standing in molotovs ect.) I have no real way of doing anything to stop them and I can't leave either. the other thing that I noticed was people farming up smurf accounts by getting a bunch of kills and carrying for the first five or six rounds and then turning an auto spin on and going afk. The vote system should change from needing all but one in team to needing a majority and autospinning should be detected. there also needs to be some way for a player to contact support with a ticket regardless of response time I mean if i could get a ticket and it would take a week but those accounts would be banned I would be completely fine with it.
