I loved playing this game, even with me and my potato computer i was able to run it with it looking amazing (except those eyes, creepy). The stealth segments felt amazing and was honestly my favourite part of the game, while the fighting felt extremely satisfying once i understood the patterns of the game.My one complaint would have to be the lack of variety in bosses, while poison ivy was my favourite boss for her unique fight, the rest were you fighting big hulking figures such as bane or some of joker's henchmen. Otherwise, amazing game.9/10
