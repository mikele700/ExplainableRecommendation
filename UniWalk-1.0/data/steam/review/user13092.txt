Fun and cheap gameNeed friends
Castle Crashers is a very fun game for singleplayer gamers and also multiplayer gamers. In the multiplayer games, most of the game is co-op but some parts are not. The graphics are nice and cartoonish. i think that the keyboard controls could be better, because we spent a long time in the controls page and randomly pressing the keys because only 1 person had a controller. Overall this is a very good game.
