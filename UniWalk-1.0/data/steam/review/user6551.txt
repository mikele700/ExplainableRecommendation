This game is deep and has a lot to learn but once you do its surprisingly addictive and really fun
A tale beautiful in both story and art design told through a fairly bland underlying combat system but even that thin, repetitive veil never gets in the way of your immersion and thus the games plot and music and visual design draw you in like no other. The only other major quarm in how abrupt the ending of The Banner Saga is, I don't want to say anymore out of fear of spoiling the game but let it be known that the ending felt a little undercooked.RegardsBohlsi
A huge upgrade from an already brilliant base game and during a sale its 5 bucks for the game and dlc i.e great ♥♥♥♥ing value
A great game if you work together with your crew and a few real life friends, tonnes of action and one of the most stessfull games of this year
