This is what Duke Nukem forever should have been. Very impressive 3D engine but be aware, it is very hard on the GPU. My 7970 frequently was 95% gpu usage. The combat is really well balanced with the swordplay being a standout from the rest of the FPS crowd. Gameplay is mostly old school with tried and true tested method of hordes of enemies one after the other. The enviroments are filled with plenty of variety with things to shoot and explode with very impressive graphical effects. You are able to take down enemies limb by limb disabling them firstly before finishing them off.Even amongst the big budget titles of today it still looks visually impressive. Gun Mechanics are good as well with a good variety of weapons with multiple upgrades and modifications on offer.There is also the odd easter eggs to find which reminds you of the old shadow warrior game from 1997. Seasoned gamers will be impressed by this. Unlike Duke Nukem forever, Shadow Warrior is a funny game with humour that actually works. You have a tag along demon character who is always giving his input on situations. At first i thought this was going to become a chore but further into the game i realised how well it was working and was keen to hear his next remark.Highly recommended and took me by surprise. Something different with that classic gameplay!
Why cant lucasarts/disney make games like this anymore?
- First few levels are a bit average I thought.- Engine looks a bit old and creaky nowadays, but not enough to distract badly from the overall feel. It certain scenarios it     does really shine though(large outdoor areas)+ Further into the game the more it started to remind me of the old Return to Castle Wolfenstein :) This is a good thing!+ Better game than Wolfenstein the new order
