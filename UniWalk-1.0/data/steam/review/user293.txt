at the first time playing this game i saw a tank-threw a grenade on the tank--accidently killed 2-3 friendies--They said it-'s okay :))))))))))))))-the next battle i saw a german infantry using a MG42-kills him using my grenade--stole his MG42, shoots randomly headshoted a random guy--then i leveled UP-11/10 GG Grenade was too OP for Noobsand the repair cost would be great for a lesson for not using a grenade wayy to much(btw that time i was lvl 0 now i-'m not that level)
