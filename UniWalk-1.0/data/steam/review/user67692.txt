I loved Team Fortress 2 for many years now because of its huge amount of servers and very fast join sessions, now to become one of the -big boys- you must pay 10 dollars for competitive or else you-'ll be called fresh meat, join long ♥♥♥ queues that take over 5 minutes and trying your best to find a game without having a hacker/s problem thanks to the MYM updateI loved that they listen to the community to add com there but personally i think they didn-'t do it to match everyone-'s expectation, I-'m still playing the game but not that much anymore since then. I just hope valve fixes this cause i wanna play this game again
One of the best zombie survival horror game EVER INVENTED

Pros: - Yelling simulator- You will get the hang of it if you play such games like the elder scrolls franchise- Beautiful graphics and atmosphere- Creative and funny dialogue from any character in the game (especially the classes in Deadliest Warrior)- Great music that fits so well for each setting of the game- Interesting objectives that makes you come back for more.Cons:- The game seems a bit laggy- The world seems so beautiful that some pcs or laptops can't handle it- Pings can expand extremely fast ( if your internet is crap )- Combat seems to be in the form of rock, paper, scissors ( especially being put in unwinnable situations as an archer )- Not enough cosmetics and hats :(Overall this game seems to be one of my favorite games in pc, but only if your internet is good. Just give it time to load up and when it picks up, you my friend are going to experience a game that really captures the medieval feel. And every gamers dream about fantasy battles as knights for being a hero ( or villain ) in a server.I love this game so muchI give it a 9.5/10
the best part about this game is that when you go to the car chase, YOU A SITTING AN INVISIBLE JET10/10
This is the definition of either a michael bay movie or AMERICA!!!!
