You NEED to buy this game.
Spent hours looking for gear only to be shot in the back by someone claiming to be friendly. I've been kidnapped and force-fed rotten food and disinfectant. Buggy, un-optimized, not finished, bare bones, human nature simulator.10/10 had a blast and would do all over again
