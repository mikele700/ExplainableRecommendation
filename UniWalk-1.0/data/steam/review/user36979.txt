This makes you feel like a truck driver. I am near a legal driving age, this game will help me drive a manaul. This really sets the bar high in my opinion for a simulation game, truelly excellent Indie Game, Totally Recommend it!
This is a truelly excellent game, one wrong move is fatal and I like this. To anyone getting this game needs to have a keen eye on everything and not to accept big bribes. This is one of the best Indie's out there.
Good, Just Excellent. Obviously my favourite concept is Pyroland! BALLOONICORN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Honestly, this has to be one of my favourite games hands down. Big fan of Racing Games, and loved this one on my old family PC with a CD-ROM (yeah, a CD :O) I wasn't allowed to play my PS1 during school term, so this was one of the only games I played. 90% finished before, this time I want to get 100%. Totally buy it, for classic Ford cars and a great racing game (wait for discount, like I did :) )
I bought this for $0.30 in the Steam Sale, It isn't the best game but excpected at the price. It's not worth $3. But it is very addicting with voice, music and constant raging of 'So Close, but next time I'll get it' and doing the trial and error. Very good but get this game during sales when cheaper, not $3
Awesome, But needs auto-save
Wheatly and Companiun Cube in the First Level, Awesome!
