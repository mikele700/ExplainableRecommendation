There might be a bug but my game starts but i can not move other wise it crashes.I play on a macPlease fix thisThanks
The game is great and has a fast loading system for online games.I do not like the idea of Premium because it gives players a advantage that destroys the game.But that seem to be the only problem.
There is a few bugs that need to be fixed.I finished the game and becasue of a bug with the tech and it would crash my game every time i got a new tech.I then started a new character thinking it would be fixed then but when i went to put the core frags in the space gate it crashed and there has not been a update to fix this bug.Please do But in tatal i love the game and would like to play it again after this bug is fixed.Thanks
I have loved playing the game but the light issues have not been fix Love the gameThanks
I love the game and if it is possible I would like a customization on the character
