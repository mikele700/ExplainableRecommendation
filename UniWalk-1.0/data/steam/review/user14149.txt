The Beginner's Guide is... well, The Beginner's Guide is different, the story it tells of a river that flows.It's all, a part of the experiance.Whether The Beginner's Guide is a work of fiction or a work of fact is something that is actually tearing me up inside, it is not often that I write reviews or actually make comment on a game's deeper meaning, but, the experiance is... Uncomfortable, and I feel that, The Beginner's Guide was designed to be just that. After playing through it a few times, you begin to connect dots that you didnt even know existed. So, should you Buy this game? Hell yea, buy it now and experiance it. The overall theme is something that, in this day and age, is more and more important.==================================Read Ahead if you wish to read my views on the subject matter.==================================.......Going to warn you here that this next bit may be considered a spoilerIf this is a work of fact, then... the subject has missed the point, but, that also seems to be the point, by continuing through the game you get the impression, through the tones used by Davey, his choice of words, and just the general feel of the final screens of the game, that as much as there is a need to continue to experiance the work of Coda, but, there is also deep deep regret within Davey.In the second chapter, the whisper chapter, you are automatically skipped through a maze section, (in which you have the option to turn back and complete it if you wish) but this single act, shows that, Davey hasnt actually learnt anything from the ordeal. But that may just be a choice to depict his mental state at the begining. With Davey only coming in about halfway through Coda's game design career, it's understandable the excitement you get from experiancing these new and wonderous creations from a mind that isn quite on the straight and narrow.Coda ensured that everything in his game's had a point, everything appeared done, from the gun that was useless and then skybox where you could see the end of the universe, things were done deliberatly. It's not my place to say that anything was done, or, if it was intended, or, if I could even have any minute semblance of an understanding of how  Coda worked. That's the point of the story. You dont know an artist through their work. Just like Davey when he told people that Coda was depressed, or in a bad state of mind, because of the theme of the little tidbits of game that he created.Coda just enjoyed what he did, and the pressure that Davey put on him, the rush, explains why he slowed down his development, because, Davey couldnt, didnt, wouldnt, understand the demons he had inside of him, his need to be validated through someone elses work. Did Davey put out these works as his own? Did he really add the lamp-posts into the games? You cant know, not unless Davey tells us so, and yet, its only a game.And you Cant know an artist through their works.
