csgo is a great compeditive game that alot of people play. i myself love it alot but the ingame cases are a easy way to lose money i sugest if you are going to open cases then just buy the items you want and not use $1000 dollars and get no profit.
nice sandbox  will will love and ther is a demo
good game :)
