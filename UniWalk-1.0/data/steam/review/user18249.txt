Having played over 200 hours of this B-E-A-UTIFUL game, I can safely say it is one THE BEST games I have ever played.
The twist of ALL twists!! Plus don't forget to wait out the credits to play the secret ending!
Really don't know what I'm doing in Rome 2 but with the help of a mate who does know what he's doing, Rome 2 has become highly enjoyable
