I must say this game is very well done. If I were to rate it, I would rate it 1,000,000,000/10! I really like how the game starts and how Wheatley helps you most of the way! My favourite part of Portal 2 is Co-Op becuase it gets more and more challenging!-------====================UPDATED 2016 EDITION====================-------Almost three years after buying this game on Steam, I still enjoy it SOOOOOOOO MUCH somehow, I have never EVER felt bored when playing this game and it has so many features and puzzles it's AWESOME!!! If your new to Steam, even if you have it on your old Xbox 360, THIS SHOULD BE THE FIRST GAME YOU BUY!!! This game is truely amazing and will always stay in my heart.
For some reason I really enjoy playing Team Fortress 2 because the graghics are AWESOME and because it is really mega FUN!---------------===============UPDATED 2016 EDITION===============---------------From almost three years of playing this game, this game is freaking AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No joke, this game is legit updated almost every month and is awesome to play again, again and AGAIN without having that boring feeling! This game is truely the best game to have on Steam and it's free to play as well. EVERYONE I know on Steam played this game as their first game on Steam. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
