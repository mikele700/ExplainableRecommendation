great game
I played the demo online, loved it. The second i saw it on steam, i bought it, no questions asked. Never regretted it for a second.  11/10
Extremely fun
Probbably one of the best games i have ever played
The most emotional 6 minute game i have ever played
A really grat game. It is great if u like stealth or if u dont like stealth much then u can just go and kill everybody that tries to stop you. Amazing story, great gameplay, and overall just amazing. 96/100
