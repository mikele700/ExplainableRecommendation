Go for it, such a great game to play with friends. The game has a save function even for multiplayer, so don't worry about the fact that most games go for quite a long time, simply save, and return later with your friends. On top of that, the game can get a little weird and wonderful when you play a dead civilisation, and end up winning with it. Does Age of Empires let you play future egyptians with death robots? I think not.
One of the greatest little discovery-combat based RPG's ever
