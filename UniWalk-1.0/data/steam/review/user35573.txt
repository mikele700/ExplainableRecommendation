In it's current state, this port is borderline unplayable unless you dont mind the audio cutting out all the time, the frame rate dropping constantly and playing with a gamepad. Wait till it gets patched/ someone fixes it, or buy it for the wii. It is really worthy of your attention, just not on the pc right now.. :(
WHY DOES THIS EXIST I HATE THIS GAME WHY MY ARM IS GOING TO FALL OFF SOON SEND HELP
