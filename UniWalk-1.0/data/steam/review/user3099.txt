Payday 2 was a great game, but now it's sinking. In addition to a metric ♥♥♥♥ton of a dlc to fund the game, and forcing the community to pay for an event, Overkill decided they needed a bit more income. MICROTRANSACTIONS. Even after they pledged to not have microtransactions. Most heinous of all, these microtransactions give stat boosts. Go fellate yourself Almir. That is all folks.
