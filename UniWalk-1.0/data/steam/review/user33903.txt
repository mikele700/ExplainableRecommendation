Extreme Lack of updates, cars sound the same, smaller cars get run off the track too easily, AI is stupid, poor customisation (currently), very annoying theme song. Just a lack of content in general. There's only so much figure-8 derbys you can do with a car you can't even upgrade. This game has been in early access for YEARS.Nice damage model though.
Cars look and handle like they were made out of plastic. Driving is a chore in this game. Still a 8/10 for dat crash physics
If it wasn't for the music this would be an immensely boring game.
♥♥♥♥ing amazing.
10/10 would recommend
