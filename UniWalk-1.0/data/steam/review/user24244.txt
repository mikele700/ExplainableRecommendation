Who dosent love being a goat and getting to do what ever the hell you want? well if you wont like being a goat and being able to do whatever the hell you want then this ame isnt for you. this game made me ♥♥♥♥ my pants (with laughter) because the amount of glitches and random moments happen so randomly and are so damn funny. this game also offers a pretty resonable size world to walk about in and to do what ever the hell you want. Even though its a muching around game I think you can have some serious fun in this game. 10 goat statues out of 10 :D
Alrighty, I know its a bit late doing a review on tf2 but who cares right? i mean like this game is amazing and in my opinion is one of the best fps out there on the gaming market today. It has hats, who dosent like a good hat every now and then to spice up theyre game play. I also like this game very much because of the amount of customization it gives you, you can make you demo man look like he's in his pj's and you cna make the heavy look like a russian assassin it's that amazing :D. All up i think this is an amazing game which i will be playing long into the future.
