I spawned for the first time, and tried to find buildings, took me an hour just to find a small town, i walked in and searched around, ate some food, got a kitchen knife, saw a cool military tent, turned the corner and crawler grabbed my leg and was all like -Hello little boy, I wanna see up yo panties...- I got killed, turns out it wasnt a ♥♥♥♥♥♥... I respawned and thought... -YOU KILLED MY FATHER! I SHALL EVENGE HIM!- And went of to find him...
Good point and click adventure, didnt really understand, but I got stuck quite a lot so its a good time consumer. 3/5 gold stars.
Starbound : It is a nice little game, that still needs to work on the biomes and planets. But, I guess I can let it go this time. Only because it is in 'BETA Stage'. I have to admit, this is a nice game that you could play for a few hours then you have to restart because you either 1. Think your guy is too overpowered. Or 2. Want to see what other worlds have in-store for you. I give it a 6/10. Only because it is still in 'BETA Stage'. But it still is pretty good.
