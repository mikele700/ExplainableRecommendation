I find this game to be a bit of a mix between Spacebuild from Garry's Mod and the sandbox of Minecraft. It has the exact same atmosphere as both and I love the gravitational and collisional physics. Ofcourse the game has a few bugs but they can be easily avoided.In the blackness of space, you assume it to be boring, but that is very far from the truth. There is so much to do infact that I actually have my hands full!
