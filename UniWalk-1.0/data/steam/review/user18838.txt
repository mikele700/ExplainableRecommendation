I love this game. if you like playing games that you can get hooked on to and play forever, this is for you. Even when you get super good at the game there is still a lot more to discover. Have you ever heard of the game called -Cube World-?  this reminds me of that. And that was my favourite game to play. And the Massive muiltiplayer world lets you fish, explore, build, fly, walk, find mounts, get awesome weapons, fight the shadow tower and ALOT! more!i highly recommend this game to anyone who has had cube world and or games like that.
Great game! has some Performance issues and server instability so needs some performance tweaks and updates
