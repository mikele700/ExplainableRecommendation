If you're looking for some less hardcore turn-based game to break up the XCOM marathons then look no further. The art style is fantastic and the characters are very well drawn and look great. It's good for a quick fix as you can finish your 5 expeditions in a couple of hours but isn't tedious and has endless replayability thanks to the crew combinations so you can play it for long periods of time. It has a nice subtle sense of humour and has some funny moments without it being the centre of attention and it helps keep the game light hearted. It has a very unique levelling system that incorperates traits which I found really enjoyable and intuitive.The only negative I have about it is that I didn't enjoy the inventory management much, but it's very simple and doesn't require much of your time.Overall the game is very cute and has a fresh new take on turn based strategy and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
What's better than blowing up terrorists in the name of freedom?NOTHINGI give this a 4th of July/10
While not graphically very good it has really fun, addicting gameplay that will suck hours from your life. It's longevity is increased by the many amazing mods. I highly reccomend the mods L'aigle and Anno Domini.
