Pros: +Good Gameplay+New/Good Story+Good Variety of Enemies+Graphics Glitches make the game more funCons:-Irritating Physics Engine-Lack of Upgrades for Abilities and Weapons9/10, is Good, would love to see a Sequel/Remaster
Really good, needs a Red Eye Orb though.
This game right here, this is how you Remaster a game.The Original was Great, but a bit buggy and quite limitted, But Rebirth came along.Contains all of the original content from Base and WOTL Isaac, but with more items, enemies, combos, characters and challenges. With Afterbirth coming out in October, Isaac is going to get even better.Also Bouncy Blood Urine Lazers will be great42/10
If you are Smart you Will get this game, and some Vitamin D10/10, Would Request a Sequel
I received this from winning a raffle with free entry, and it still wasn't worth it.Incredibly lazy worldbuilding, models and AI, Sounds are on the edge of pointless, even on high-end PC's there are generally issues and crashes which make it unplayable, whilst also having quite long load times for such a simple and barely function game. Firing a weapon is near impossible, as it requires you to only be able to use the crosshair, aiming down sights shows you the incredibly generic weapon models, and blocks your view near completely. The enemies can't kill you, and even if they could, you'd be dead instantly, as their AI is incredibly limited to waiting until you get near enough and then proceding to push through the walls to kill you. If the Dev even cared anymore, he could at least attempt to patch this game, but that in itself would be ~such~ a task.TL:DR- The Dev needs to get his ♥♥♥♥ together if he wants people to play and buy this game.
Good Game, could use an update that adds more levels, weapons, upgrades, but pretty good for a $3 indiegala bundle.Seriously Devs, make an update that adds more, and I could see more money in it for you.
SO MANY FEELS FOR JUST A MOUNTAIN10/10 would attempt to buy the sequel
Yeah, sure, why not?
Brilliant game, can play multiplayer by downloading Synergy :D
