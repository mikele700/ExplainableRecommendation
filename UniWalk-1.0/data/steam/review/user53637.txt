Boring and overpriced - plain and simple. It-'s a good thing I bought this for $10 on special, because I enjoyed the game for around an hour, before realising that the basic game you-'re given, is really only worth $10. Sure you can tell they-'ve tried to make the few routes they provide with the Steam edition visually appealing, and it seems like an authentic experience (I don-'t know much about driving trains, I-'m not a professonal), but if sitting, staring at your screen for an hour, waiting for your train (from the minuscule selection you-'re provided to start with) to exceed the speed limit a little bit and then pulling a lever slightly is authentic, frankly I don-'t really care because this -game- is not necessary - I hate to be harsh, but perhaps if the dlc wasn-'t so expensive, I wouldn-'t care as much. I love trains, but this just isn-'t compelling.
Using classic tables, beautiful graphics and realistic physics, it's just a pinball game. And it's so satisfying.
If chess and the Spore space stage had a baby, this'd be it - the eternally replayable, incredibly addictive Endless Space.
