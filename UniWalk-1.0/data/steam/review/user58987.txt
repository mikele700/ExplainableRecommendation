The only initial reason why I got this game was so I could yell -SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEEEEEEEEEECCCCCCCCCCC!!!- like a dingus for the rest of my life playing this, and now we can crash land into an unknown abyss pondering on what lies ahead for us travellers and then try to set up a little civilization just to get by. It has changed so much since 2013 and many people may complain that we-'re proceeding into complex gmaeplay too fast and possibly too soon. Although, the update for a more complex gameplay is what makes the game we know today after 2 years of it-'s development and it still goes strong today.pros:--SPAEC!!!--crash landings-endless possibilities (not literally, but possibly)-more chances of dying from being a dingus-still contains its previous aspects before the big updatecons:-none that I know of so far (unless people complaining about its new complex system counts)Overall, it is still a great game to goof around with your friends along with more possible role play scenarios (if you guys are into that stuff) and even though this has been one huge step-up, it is still the game we know and love to enjoy.
I have to say, this game hit my high expectations and it hits basic MMORPG standards which is fun alone itself without the detail and stuff which makes it classed as -barely a game- but it-'s fun. I mean, it has it-'s dowfalls (possibly for now) like no Aussie server (but I ain-'t complaining), extra worlds pre-made from the developers (makes it easier on you skyscraper kids who like fancy XP) and that is as much as I can list for now. There may be more that I haven-'t encountered or listed but this definitely does make me fancy this for more.
Ok, this is really difficult to explain as far as...well, EVERYTHING goes. It is definitely not your average dating sim and that is a fact that we know. To be honest, I-'m not the usually one to mess with dating sims nor am I one to be into this side of games but this somehow bypassed my attention since it was a bit more intersting than what I thought.When I first started playing this, I was more afraid of the -sightings- at first or what I might be in for but as I progressed through it started to become second nature and I will say this to those who are in this position, just let it happen, it will end.This is one true masterpiece due to it-'s playability and of course, good choice of appearance and personality to each girl and it mixes quite nicely and with it being a mix of -Candy Crush- as everyone would say, think or express (which makes sense since it is pretty much the only game that not many people can tear themselves away from other than Bejeweled). I would also like to add the end, is never the end. There is more -bedwork- that needs to be done  but I won-'t spoil it for those progressing or those interested except for this bit, once you have done all of the girls and I mean ALL of them, there is a thing called -Alpha Mode-. Trust me, you NEED to get your game faces on because just getting your night date over and done with like it-'s a walk in the park and then enjoying ( or however you deal with the matter like waiting for it to get over and done with) the screams of joy from your girl isn-'t going to cut, this mode is no joke, as soon as you start, it starts NOW, as in as soon as you initiate it and the delight side of it is taken away and is officially a rage game at a certain degree but those who know their ways can achieve the best.P.S (EXTRA SPOILER): It also involves a neko and an alien but you guys can figure out how to achive their hearts. plus the achievement name for the alien is hilarious and it was well thought of as well for the name of it is -ayy lmao- and once I saw that, I spent a few minutes trying not to crush my brain from laughter and pass out from lack of oxygen, it-'s my weird humour that I like.P.P.S: You have to do quizes on these chicks so you better learn them up and get -'em right and you-'ll have to learn cat stuff and try and be an astronomist for the neko and alien so...you should ask if you could join NASA while you-'re at it.Rating:Candy getting crushed by 24 bewbs/10(DAMMIT, another spoiler XD)
