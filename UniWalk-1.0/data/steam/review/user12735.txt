Positives & Tips:Good game, make sure you use the correct bait. I prfer using petfood on catfish and hook #2, it's also healthy for the fish, also it doesn't hurt the fish, and make sure you don't use a chemically painted bobber or else you will contaminate your fish. Make sure you say fish in chat, community is helpful and nice. Give tips and people will rub yours. Nice game. 2 Good. Negative review: THIS GAME SUCKS BALLS AND YOU SHOULD NOT PLAY IT, FULL OF ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S, PEOPLE SAY ♥♥♥♥ YOU. ITS A ♥♥♥♥ING WAR ZONE AND THE FISH SMELL LIKE ♥♥♥♥ AND IT SHOULD DIE IN A HOLE...wait to fishes have genders...YEAH THEY DOI prefere using your own ♥♥♥♥ as bait...Say fish in chat and people will ♥♥♥♥ you up...Community is a whole bunch of rude little 5 year olds not getting a life and they should feel sad
