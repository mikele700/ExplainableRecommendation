just beat this on hardiest difficulty.i must say, landing headshots over 200m with wind affecting the bullet on top of gravity feels fantastic with the bullet cam.it might be the settings but i do sometimes get shot by enemy snipers who does randomly 90-180 degree turns and instantly shoot me after the turn, sometimes even before the turning finish.
more geralt goodies, somehow even better.
cool story, cool combat, cool monsters.this is one of the game that should definitly worth a try.
get it and watch it picks off your life one pixel at a time
at the current state, the games content is mostly evolved around escort everyone and babysit everyone.aside from the quests which makes the story more interesting, gathering resources became a one man job, mostly, because you can only call for 1 scavenger at a time, and they will walk to the destination and collect a single sack of loot, then return home, which seems helpful at first, but later found out these so called scavengers will very often stuck and call for help, which then the player has to go and bail them out, alot of cases, when i finally get to them, there is very few zombies around, the scavenger will not move until the area is cleared.moving onto the combat, there is one thing bugs me greatly, at home base, suppressor can be crafted in the work shop, which is used to allow guns to be silenced until it is worn out, but there is no projectile weapon such as crossbow and bow, either these and the arrow/bolt they use will be much easier to craft then the suppressor itself, and produce less noise when used compared to a firearm.melee combat seems interesting at first, but i found it very lacking in damage progression, at max fighting skill level, it will still require at least 2 swings with a heavy weapon to get the zombie into a state where excute mechanics can be used. Power attack(sprint and attack) does virtually nothing better then a normal attack except more time consuming.the quest generally consist holding off zombies and clear the area or hunt down a certain zombie.my conclution, the mechanics of this game in general has out paced its stories, since it keeps adding timed events which will penalise the player for missing them on top of the quest story, supply gathering and the restriction around those so you cannot do more then 1 quest at a time, even if they consist the same sort of goal, multiple supplies cannot be loaded onto cars and must be carried by someone in order to take home.Edit 1: since it has been updated and i will go back into playing this for a bit and make changes to my review
a well made game in general
