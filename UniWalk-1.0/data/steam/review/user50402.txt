Love this game, probably isnt as enjoyable as 1 and 2 but still love this game! Highly reccomended!! :)
This is a really fun good game that is worth getting fot the price of it. A great feature is being able to connect your Xbox One controller or Play Station controller up to your PC and being able to use it to play this game. I also really like being able to play with people on PS4 while playing on PC.I'm sure you'll really enjoy this game and I would highly recommend it
