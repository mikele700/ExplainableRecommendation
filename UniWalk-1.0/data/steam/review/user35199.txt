Definitely a great game. It has an amazing, complex story, a nice european setting, and some pretty awesome weapons. And maybe a small plot twist or two. Maybe.Also has a crazy monk. That is all.
For a horror, it's not that scary. Unless your COMPLETELY unprepared!Probably the best zombie game ever. Definitely a 100/10.
