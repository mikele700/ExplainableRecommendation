Look, before you hate me for recommending a game that is ---p2p---  hear me out, okay? This game is a block-ish mmorpg game that has a fair amount of detauls to their textureGameplay is very unique as many different characters can somehow compliment each other---'s play styleAnd encourages playing with many people through Skype or some form of chatting. This game is free but has the title p2p as the items in the in game stores boost leveling up rate by alotThough buying through the store may give one an advantage, the items in the shop are merely end game itemsAvailable to the player through cash, and even if u were to want to buy characters or potions u could always save up Hope this review has helped one of you

A Good Open World MMORPG with good mechanics  there is a little of a pay to win in it but you still could do WITHOUT paying ANYTHING.Yes i would recomend this game if you're looking for a good MMORPG with an okay-ish communityIf you did not know you can lower the minimum speculations of your computer to a 1 gigabytes worth of ram and just a windows 7 starter.runs fine
