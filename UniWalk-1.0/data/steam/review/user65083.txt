Planetside 2 is an MMO FPS RPG, and one of the first of it's kind. It was developed by Sony Online Entertainment (SOE), a well known game development company behind MMOs such as Everquest, DC Universe, and the original Planetside. As it's name suggests, it takes place in humanity's future on the faraway planet of Auraxis.Three powerful factions: the Terran Republic, New Conglomerate, and Vanu Sovereignty, slug it out to control as much territory and resources as possible. You fight on 4 unique continents (large maps), where huge, often awesome battles with infantry, ground vehicles and aircraft occur. Planetside 2 is a game to be played with a squad or platoon of friends, as playing lone wolf can be difficult, repetitive, and at times, boring.In organised outfits (clans), though, the game can create great memories. It requires a decent computer, and it's detailed large-scale environments and battles can take down the fps on cheaper rigs. I'm going to give Planetside 2 an 8 out of 10.
