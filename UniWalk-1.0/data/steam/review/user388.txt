HOLY ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥!
The trailer was cool lol I guess it's k
Amazing! Well done by Valve to make an amazing casual shooter.
An oldie but a goodie. Your path is very flexible and has everything an RPG needs.
Team Fortress 2 is a cartoon-like first person shooter. The diversity of classes is amazing while keeping no class overpowered/underpowered. Best free-to-play game out there, better for the P2P's. <3.
this game is great 10/10
