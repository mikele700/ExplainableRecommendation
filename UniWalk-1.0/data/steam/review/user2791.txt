I have put just over 500 hours into this game and it is one of my most favourites and I highly recommend getting it if not all ready as it is lots of fun when you have friends playing it with you and there is also 2 types of gamemodes you can play now [the legacy and experimental] this game is still an early access so there are some bugs but over all it is very fun the only problems I have ever had in this game though are the hackers in the legacy they are so annoying and some severs I join the admins either don't ban them or the admins are friends with them so I hope that the devs can work out a way to fix this issue as it is just a neusence how they can fly into your base and take all the goods but other then that it is so fun sometimes I never want to stop playing this so I rate this game 10/10
