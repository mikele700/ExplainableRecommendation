This game is about if Minecraft and Call Of Duty had a baby...Really great fun to play though.
Recommend this to players who like digging  themselves into mysteries and like aventure games.Thief brings you a great opportunity to play a great game with your friends (this is what i did).100/90
I wanted to buy COD, but my mom let me buy only this one. I had a great fun collecting gems, which I could spend to buy a new kickass tiara.
Drop is coming..
