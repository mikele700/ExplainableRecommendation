this is a really beautiful and well made game even though it is still in alpha.Pros:-beautiful graphics.-wonderful gameplay mechanics.-its not pay 2 win centered like other MMO games.Cons:-graphics heavy (meaning if you have a laptop like me FPS may be affected).
it is a good game but it does have its bugs like most new releases do so yeah i would reccomend but only if u dont mind playing a half done game
