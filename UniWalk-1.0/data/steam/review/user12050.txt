I've played this game way to much.JOIN ME IN MY PLIGHT
I do not regret this purchase. A much more refined version of the original, and now with synergies abound! Curvy lasers!
A fun game. Rogue Legacy has all that I could want from a game of this genre, and adds in a little bit more to the mix, creating a great gameplay experience.
An entertaining game with a nice sense of humour. :D
