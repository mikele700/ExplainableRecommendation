-Eww~, is dis some sorta sonic on genesis days rip off thing? Imma call mah SEGA to sue u~ >:c-We all know this thing has those genesis elements back in the days, but also bringing in new elements that the genesis definitely couldn-'t achieve. And even though I was never the kid who experienced the early 90 genesis/Super Nintendo games, it still gave me a stange effect of nostalgia somehow.  Like for some reason reminds me of MapleStory (as we all know the game doesn-'t really stand strong anymore today ;-;), maybe because it was one of the 2D nowaday games that differ themselves away from the massive amount of 3D games released in the past few years. Overall, Freedom Planet is magnificent, definitely give this a buy or at the very least, download the demo =3(Also if anyone who-'s one of my subscribers on Youtube -SuckyEngy Izumi-, I-'ll be making a weird review about this game, and please don-'t take it seriously, I was just bored)
Only after a few months and this game got the hits that unexpectedly rocked the media, and just when I thought it was enough, there's a sequel. That gives gmod/SFM ers some fun as well.
