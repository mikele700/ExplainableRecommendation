WARNING: ANGRY RANTToo be honest Ubisoft has been burning the bridge for a while now. But now there is nothing left to burn. Microtransaction and companion apps to open chests ingame are immersion breaking. I with a 970 cant even run this game without turning down the graphics way down until the game looks like ♥♥♥ and yet still the game refuses to run for 10 min before it has some dumbass problem that kills the game.And that's not even mentioning the bugs and Glitches that you will stumble across within 10-20 min of gameplay, Ac unity in its current full released stage is more broken, buggy, glitchy than Star Citizen which is in its pre-aphla/aphla stage.Months after full release and Ubisoft is apparently trying to fix the game from crashing (so says the giatn headlines). This is ridiculous, i payed $50 (sympathy fro those who payed full price) for an unfinished game, im wouldnt be surprised if that the next Assasins Creed got no attention at all.The Combat, stealth and freerunning system are all pretty much the same with no fresh ideas, what Ubisoft has done is pick up everything from the trash can, put it in a new setting and pushed out a game that deserves nothing.-4/15 Would never reccomend this to anyone.P.S if your wondering y i have almost no hours is becasue i cant even run the game on mediuem/low for 10 min with my brand new computer GTX 970, 16GB rammUbisoft Rest in peppironies.
