This game had plenty of potential when I bought it in early acess over a year ago. The company is known for creating very substandard games. The monstrosoty starforge was a very big cash grab for their audience. Never the less we gave them a chance. After a year of development the game is still extremley similiar with barely anything added. The game is ruined by bugs and hackers and the developers don't listen to the community. I will never purchase anyother codehatch game again. I've put many hours into this game and I can't believe I've wasted so much time on such tripe. If you want to waste time in anger then go ahead and play it.
This game is amazing. I can not believe the devs chose to make this a free to play, I would easily pay $10-$15+ on it. It's a mix between dayz and minecraft but so much more! Easily 10/10!
I have a couple hours on it (over 1300), it is my favourite game by far. There is many things you can do sure you can make ragdolls to stupid ♥♥♥♥ but wait till you get on TTT, Prophunt, Pirate ship wars, Murder, Morbus and my favourite Dark Rp. You should definately get this game!
