Excellent TBS game I highly reccomend this game if you're ready to get your ♥♥♥ kicked even on the lowest difficulty in this brutal and unforgiving game, the game still also has a few bugs here and there but nothing too major thus far. If you're looking for a game to get your mind going this is the game for you.
Excellent game for an early Beta, Build whatever you can imagine and either watch it work gracefully or collapse and burn in a glorious way it really gets your imagination and inner engineer in motion and I look forward to futher updates of this game.
