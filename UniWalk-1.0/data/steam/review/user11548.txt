Probably by far the best blend of strategy and RPG I've seen in a while. It's kind of a blend of Risk/Total War/ & Elder Scrolls.The combat is entrhalling as it's realistic sword fighting in the sense you have to parry and attack from different angles, sort of what is incorporated in The Witcher series, although attacking with a polearm or shooting a bow from a mount is too good to pass up (join tournaments and place bets on yourself to make a quick profit). Steal, cheat, be treatorous, take prisoners who were bludgeoned in battle and sell them to Ransom traders, hire mercenaries - equip and pay their wages, join campaigns and swear allegiance to a Lord and take down the other factions with due haste. Lots of little quests that makes you feel true to medieval war/life.The only down side is possibly that it feels dated. Still that's not a reason not to play a game. Still very immersive.8/10
A new take on killing zombies from above using an arsenal of mad weapons and mercenary crews. Not as much focus on the violence, which leaves room for the planning and sheer panic of trying to get your citizens out of the city alive and not falling into outbreak by letting one simple zombie into the crowd.The gameplay leaves room for challenge as each month you'll have rostered mercenaries which some fights only leaves you with roadblocks mines and snipers. Though very satisfying when you complete the mission.All in all it has probably been the best $2.49 I have ever spent on a game, I would honestly of paid more for it.Fun, addictive and challenging.
