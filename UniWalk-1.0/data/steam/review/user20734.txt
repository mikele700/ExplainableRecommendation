Incredibly action packed and amazingly fun.  This makes me wait for half life 3/ half life 2 episode 3.
Incredibly intense, Action packed as hell, Great story, Amazing and likeable characters, amazing level design and overall incredibly fun to play. This serves as a perfect successor to the orginal half life.
Despite the outdated graphics, Half Life is a pure fun and challenging game, It will keep you entertained for hours. I recommend that you play it to the very end.
Best fallout game.Every quest is original, Its extremely fun and the story is great. Loved the amount of choice in quests, really does feel like an rpg.
Serves as more of a continuation of the story. But that doesn't stop it from being incredibly fun.
