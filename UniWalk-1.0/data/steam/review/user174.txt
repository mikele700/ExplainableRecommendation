it did not send my code play! waste of money
I Really LOVE this game!This is the best game for social interaction and wasting your money.
its hard to get used to but its awsome when you can learn new skills and tricks
i love the game and i recommend this game and i hope a update comes because we need sandbox mode please for the people who want money and items
i like how a small game can be this popular
really fun!
honestly it's ok for a card game.it need improvement but in time the gam will get better just right now its just a ok game not 10/10 material.i would rate this game a 6/10
really fun game
