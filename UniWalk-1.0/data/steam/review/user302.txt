Therez suttin' ta be holla'd fo' dis game, n' by extension dis entire series. Put ya mutha♥♥♥♥in choppers up if ya feel dis! It aint nuthin but a game thatz part of tha oldschool breed dat has survived tha decade n' has mostly retained its visceral, gunfighter esque, snappy gameplay wit a underlyin competitve element dat forces tha playa ta outthink hos opponent first n' outreact themt ta a lesser degree. Everyone be a crewplayer, n' if you not, tha magic of dis game is dat it forces you to, fo' a lack of mo' betta lyrics, git phat at it, n' cuz of dat it propels tha user ta try n' stand toe ta toe wit veterans n' freshly smoked up blood alike on a almost punishingly level ground. Y'all KNOW dat ♥♥♥♥, mutha♥♥♥♥a! Counter Strike Source is by far da most thugged-out ghettofab varaint of tha Counter Strike series, fo' tha phat reason dat past tha core elementz of tha game from rescuin hostages ta defusin (or planting) bombs, there be a much mo' user pimped content dat dis game owes its engine like a mutha♥♥♥♥a. This game be a must have, cuz if not fo' tha forever relevent competitizzle scene, itz fo' tha bhop maps, zombie escapes, jail breaks, mini games, n' fo' tha mobilitizzle ta git a game wit hthe Source Engine SDK.It aint nuthin but not a game dat has aethestically kept wit time yo, but its forumla has, n' I bet dat it will outlive even tha juggernautz of tha younger Call of Duty n' Battlefield titles. This be a game of not reqardin tha playa wit trinkets like ♥♥♥♥in freshly smoked up glocks or freshly smoked up faces ta wear yo, but of self satisfaction of whoopin up a entire enemy crew up in a cold-♥♥♥ lil clutch move n' brangin down tha hurt wit a well gots AWP. That runs deep, n' dis game aint NEVER gonna make you forget dat tha only thang seperatin you from acin wit a Deagle n' viewin yo' crew fro ma spectators seat is yo' own skill.

To commemorate tha beta of Steam Reviews, it only make sense dat I finally write a recommendation fo' a game dat has been close ta mah ♥♥♥ since tha dizzle I was first introduced ta it: Terraria.Terraria has proven ta be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of funk ta play, n' has been one of mah freshest vizzle game time sinks up in recent mutha♥♥♥♥in years cuz of dat ♥♥♥♥. Between lenient system requirements, a solid (albeit imbalanced, at times) combat system, a funky-♥♥♥ broad permittizzle fo' exploration n' a wide selection of buildin decor, itz tha type of game dat strikes me as havin suttin' fo' everyone. Which is good, when you consider dat it also has multiplayer n' ♥♥♥♥. Even mo' betta when you git ta tha late game, which has a wide array of weapons, armors n' tools ta allow fo' a wide variety of specializations.Buildin n' exploration is phat points up in favor of tha game yo, but tha gameplay mechanics is suttin' I'd like ta single up fo' praise. For a 2D game, its combat system has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of spectacle, n' like thatz part of why I find it so charmin yo. Hurtin enemies--even dem playas whoz ♥♥♥ is vastly inferior ta you--feels good. Y'all KNOW dat ♥♥♥♥, mutha♥♥♥♥a! I be fly as a gangbangin' falcon, soarin all up in tha sky dawwwwg! It aint nuthin but satisfyin ta hear tha hit sound on tha mo' squishy enemies, n' peep dem explode tha ♥♥♥♥ into fine lil chunks when they take a thugged-out dirt nap. Ground movement could be mo' betta yo, but certain late game ♥♥♥♥ hit you wit tha mobilitizzle ta dash n' fly, which straight-up expand how tha ♥♥♥♥ you can explore n' fight fo' realz. And wit a wide selection of weapons, every last mutha♥♥♥♥in playa is bound ta find a rosta of tools, spells n' fish-related artillery dat fits they playstyle.Da game aint without flaws, mind yo thugged-out ♥♥♥. With tha gamez update history, tha launch endgame now vastly differs from dat of tha current one. This has hustled ta some balizzle n' progression issues, da most thugged-out glarin of which bein how tha ♥♥♥♥ sluggish tha early game feels. Well shiiiit, it worries me dat tha start of tha game might dissuade some playas from playing, when they might ludd what tha ♥♥♥♥ tha late game has ta offer n' ♥♥♥♥. Da game also has a wack g-thang of recyclin mob AI wit reskins, though dis be averted by adjustin certain parametas n' givin dem unique abilitizzles ta hide tha fact. Even though I have mo' ta say bout tha shortcomings, there be a just too much phat up in tha game ta stay mad bout what tha ♥♥♥♥ effectively boils down ta nitpicking.Plus, it has hats fo' realz. Any game dat has a selection of basebizzle caps gets brownie points.Watch some trailers. Read some other props. If dis be lookin like suttin' you'd be interested in, then take it from me: give Terraria a cold-♥♥♥ lil chance. Da game occasionally goes on sale fo' 75% off, so pick up a gangbangin' four pack fo' yo ♥♥♥ n' three playas. If I be wrong, then I cost you a meal at Subway--not subliminal advertising--and I be sorry as a mutha♥♥♥♥a bout dat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. But if I be right, then it'll be well worth tha price. We sposed ta ♥♥♥♥in pay $60 these minutes fo' a gangbangin' fulfillin gamin experience. This is one that'll run you $10, at most.

Awesomenauts... one of the best Indie MOBAs I've EVER and I mean EVER played! Not only the graphics, even though 2D they are polished and very nice. The wide range of playeble characters (called Nauts), there is a Naut to suit Anyone. Awesomenauts is basically 2D Dota, Basically. With the Nice cartoon like graphics and a massive online community where you can share ideas for the devs to look at and discuss, share Naut build and since it is a indie game, the developers actually READ the suggestions and therefore making the game a better experience for everyone! I give Aweosmenauts a good 9/10 for the very polished Indie MOBA :DDD
In dis game yo ♥♥♥ be a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist whoz ♥♥♥ has never fired a glock up in they game before a round starts, n-' you can put dat on yo-' toast. Yo ♥♥♥ must help yo-' character learn how tha ♥♥♥♥ ta control they glocks while cappin-' enemies. Put ya mutha♥♥♥♥in choppers up if ya feel dis! Right back up in yo mutha♥♥♥♥in ♥♥♥. Strangely, each character has tha mysterious juice ta fire one or two shots without wack recoil by straight-up briefly jerkin up in tha opposite direction they is movin in. I aint talkin-' bout chicken n-' gravy ♥♥♥♥♥♥. When yo-' character wears a Kevlar vest, every last mutha♥♥♥♥in part of yo-' character, except tha head, is made outta steel. Therefore, tha only way ta quickly bust a cap up in playas is ta blast dem up in tha head. Y-'all KNOW dat ♥♥♥♥, mutha♥♥♥♥a! This can be buggin at first yo, but yo big-♥♥♥ booty is ghon soon git used ta blastin a lil-' small-♥♥♥ smudge of pixels on top of a cold-♥♥♥ lil characterz body. Da Goddess of Guns can materialize glocks up in yo-' characterz handz all dem secondz before a round starts, n-' you can put dat on yo-' toast. But ♥♥♥♥ dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat yo-' character must pay fo-' tha guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have tha right amount of scrilla, tha Goddess will flash a menu up in yo-' characterz eyes, allowin dem ta select tha glocks they want. Mo-' advanced playas can make glocks materialize outta thin air wit they mind as long as they have tha right amount of scrilla.Maps is often bout evil terrorists tryin ta take a thugged-out dump on deserted places. Vandalizzle be a straight-up straight-up crime up in tha Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists is deployed ta stop em. Unfortunately fo-' tha Terrorists, they is dumb n-' only packed one bomb. But ♥♥♥♥ dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat tha Counter-Terrorists do not know how tha ♥♥♥♥ ta pick up a thugged-out dropped bomb, so tha Terrorists can still pick it up afta it is dropped by a gangbangin-' fallen playa.In some maps, tha terrorists have kidnapped a janitor n-' low-level desk jockey up in a funky-♥♥♥ building. Da Counter-Terrorists done been deployed ta save one, not both, of tha hostages. In reality, dis is just a thinly-veiled excuse fo-' tha CTs ta cappin-' tha Terrorists while pumpin roundz tha ♥♥♥♥ into tha invincible hostages. One weird thang bout hostage maps is dat you can purchase a -Hostage Rescue Kit-, which somehow make gives you tha mobilitizzle ta put a grown playa on yo-' shouldaz up in a second. Y-'all KNOW dat ♥♥♥♥, mutha♥♥♥♥a! Perhaps it aint nuthin but a spell scroll dat allows hostages ta hover ta yo-' characterz shoulders. Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive be a surprisingly solid game bout playas wit da most thugged-out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ glock handlin abilitizzles eva peeped on Earth. Even though yo-' charactas have tha aimin abilitizzlez of one of mah thugs wit Parkinsons Disease, you have nuff tactical options dat make tha game straight-up funk n-' dynamic. It aint nuthin but worth pickin up.ORIGINAL REVIEW BY          DUNCAN DONUTS     http://steamcommunity.com/id/teflon1
RUBBISH GAME! DO NOT PLAY, EVEN IF IT IS FREE!ABSOLUTE, UTTER ♥♥♥♥♥!I DINNAE KNOW WHY YOU WOULD PLAY THIS GAME, WHEN IT'S ESSENTIALLY JUSTAN UNREAL TOURNAMENT-ESQUE GAME, WITH ALL THE FUN SPEED REMOVED, ANDARBITRARY LIMITATIONS PLACED ON VISUAL CUSTOMISATION AND WEAPONS.
Extremely TOXIC (horrible) -community-, da most thugged-out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ I-'ve peeped up in any game, EVER! Yes, worse than tha oldschool Ghetto of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥znit Barrens chat son! I-'ve now played mo-' than 64 matches total & also completed every last mutha♥♥♥♥in single hustlin mission n-' I-'ve witnessed not just tha other crew but even crewmates comin-' at eachother & mah dirty ♥♥♥ verbally before tha pimp selection even starts multiple times. I couldn-'t give a ♥♥♥♥in shiznit if tha other crew trash talks sometimes yo, but up in a game where crewwork n-' communication be a key ta ballin itz detrimenstrual fo-' playas on tha same crew whoz ♥♥♥ don-'t even know eachother ta abuse eachother fo-' no reason. I aint talkin-' bout chicken n-' gravy ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I don-'t even have enough -reports- left fo-' dis week, fo-'sho, they allot you a lil-' small-♥♥♥ number of times you can report playas per week fo-' bein punk ♥♥♥ or detrimenstrual ta yo-' crew, when up in fact you need nuff mo-' ta report all tha ♥♥♥♥♥♥ playas playin dis game.GOOD LUCK if you want phat communication n-' crewmork, tha majoritizzle of tha time yo big-♥♥♥ booty is ghon be matched wit playas whoz ♥♥♥ won-'t rap properly up in chat or won-'t work as a crew, you gonna gotta end up soloin every last mutha♥♥♥♥in match since yo-' crewmates is ghon be -feeding- enemy heroes or off bustin whoz ♥♥♥ knows what tha ♥♥♥♥ unless you have yo-' own jam of playaz up in yo-' faaaaaace!If you aint gots any playaz quein fo-' matches wit you I suggest never pickin a support since you gonna NEED ta be soloin 1 vs 5, which is unfair as it is. But tha problems don-'t end there, since yo ♥♥♥ is bustin all tha work yo-' -teammates- will EXPECT you ta win tha game fo-' them, n-' if you take a thugged-out dirtnap they will verbally abuse you & report you or up in fact they might do it anyway just fo-' funk at yo-' expense!If you only chizzle up in tha options ta ♥♥♥♥ wit Gangsta playas, don-'t be surprised if noone on yo-' randomly selected crew but you speaks Gangsta!, instead it is ghon be Spanish, Turkish, Chinese, Russian & mo-' biaaatch! They may even know Gangsta but just chizzle not ta drop a rhyme it, all tha while trash rappin-' you up in they own natizzle language.Many times if you rap r crewmates which lane yo ♥♥♥ is takin before tha match starts n-' select it on tha map they will insist minutes afta tha match has started dat instead you do what tha ♥♥♥♥ THEY want, fo-' example they want you ta put a low on mana SUPPORT pimp by themself up in tha MIDDLE LANE.If you eva notice yo-' crewmates ignorin tha chat or bustin thangs together dat may or may not be detrimenstrual ta ballin tha match itz cuz tha majoritizzle of tha time yo big-♥♥♥ booty is ghon be matched wit playas whoz ♥♥♥ know eachother up in real game n-' will only rap wit eachother OUTSIDE of tha game, whether by up in person, or voice communication software, instead of communicatin wit you as well inside tha game, so you gonna git NO IDEA what tha ♥♥♥♥ they is planning.Also, fo-' tha freshly smoked up playas readin dis review, do not expect ANY help fo-' ANYTHING, like askin fo-' lyrics or how tha ♥♥♥♥ ta do suttin-' from tha playas yo ♥♥♥ is playin with, as you WILL be verbally played & reported (which is suttin-' dat seems ta happen often up in dis game whether yo ♥♥♥ is freshly smoked up or not) instead just fo-' bein a freshly smoked up playa or any other wack reason, so I suggest bustin ALL tha hustlin missions before you do any real random matchmaking.All dat bein holla-'d I do recommend (not highly) dis game afta all if yo ♥♥♥ is playin it wit a crew of playaz & you ludd a highly competitizzle Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) aka real-time game (ARTS) game or you simply wanna use its steam market.ORIGINAL REVEIW BY          Am❤          http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198099901747
