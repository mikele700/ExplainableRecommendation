Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 was the remake of the original Hyperdimension Neptunia on the PS3. This game was imported directly from PS Vita to PC, and has many fans pleased since they may not own a Vita. The game uses the mechanics from Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory and Hyperdimesion Mk 2, the voice acting has been revamped as well due to this game being a remake and all. The story is as follows and it's basic and simple, go find the Key Fragments that reside in each of the four nations to get your shares and other nations shares back up. The thing is some of the CPU's may be hostile and choose not to help Neptune, so Neptune just goes to find them herself with IF and Compa. Overall this game is surprisingly good, both of the endings are really nice and look forward to. The characters each have their own personality and are very original, so I'll recommend this game to someone with minor JRPG and major JRP experience.
