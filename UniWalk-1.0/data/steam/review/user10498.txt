Good MMO, combat is much better and more unique than other games (WoW)The free 2 play model is amazing, with almost all gear you can earn.Only problem is the optimisation which gives you huge fps drops even with a good card.
Great game, good story and gameplay! If you haven't picked up a Tomb Raider Game before, this is a great one to pick up. If you still don't want to purchase this game, wait until a sale when it can drop down to around $3.
10/10 fun, addictive, easy to become good, hard to master. Rewards you for playing even when you lose!
