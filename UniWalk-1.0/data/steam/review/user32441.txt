The only game i have ever felt confident preordering (in this sad day and age where developers are realeasing horibbly un-optimised games and console ports), and i was not dissapointed. It has lived up to all the hype and runs extremely well on a high end system like mine, but can also run reasonably well on a low end system.Ps. Its a Hideo Kojima game.

The amount of people that treat darkRP just like real life is too damn high.
People that you love and hate will die, so this game can be really sad or really awesome depending on what happens.
Took me a full 45 min round to discover how to mute people in this game when some 12 year old kid started singing in russian while his parents were litterally screaming at each other in the background. It was the longest three quarters of an hour ive ever had to endure.0/10 - Needs a more conveniently located noob friendly mute button.
