Pros:-Great Atmosphere-Great Graphics-Good Gunplay (exept some of the sounds arent that good)-Can run it on high on a mid range laptom (good optimisation)Cons:-The supporting characters are basically tour guides they tell you everything and you can let them do all the work-Some sound assets
This game is one of the best tactical shooters on the market today.
