This game is as beautiful-looking as it plays good. If you are looking for a game with:-Great, gripping narrative-Great Gameplay-Great Soundtrack-Great visual/art style.-Great game all aroundThen this is YOUR game. If you are into platformers, this is a great game for you. This is not an EASY platformer either. In fact, once you beat the game and want to challenge yourself some more, there are some hard as hell achievements to go after which will no doubt keep you wanting to come back.Though Ori and the Blind Forest does not tell a story with a huge amount of dialect, it does not need to. The characters themselves are quick to identify with which I must give the developers an A+ for because within the first five minutes of the game at the end of the Prologue (which I recommend you do before playing the main story), I was crying. This game will pull at your heartstrings. This is a story that tells one of tragedy. The way the story is portrayed is beautiful. The soundtrack really sets the tone of it too. You will not just feel sad for Ori, you will feel sad for the other characters too, even the villainess.I cannot recommend this game enough, this is by far, one of the BEST games I have ever played on Steam by far. My only, ONLY gripe with this game is that there are some areas which, once you complete you cannot return to if you wish to hunt for collectibles which means you cannot get 100% completion if you miss those collectibles. I hope the devs can somehow fix this. Asides from that though, this game deserves all the praise and recognition it has been receiving from the public. This is, A GREAT GAME.My rating:9.5/10The only reason it lost the 0.5 was due to the issue of some areas become closed off permanately so if you miss the collectibles, you miss out for good unless you replay the game from the beginning. But don't let that stop you from playing this game. It is great, a worthy addition to anyone's Steam Library or on any other platform this is available.
