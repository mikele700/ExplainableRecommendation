I feel that the game crashes in gta are just part of the experience, the game requires a very very very patient person and a very very very large hard drive to keep all the backup folders. I suggest buying this for the soul purpose of getting a Kim Jong un mod and shooting the ♥♥♥♥ out of him, also I recommend GTA V as it will be delayed again and they will just take your money and laugh. All in all 21/10 would bang again.
