Quite a strange game, but enjoyable. Many of hours of randomness and laughter. (Not for everyone) It is very buggy but in my opinion adds to the fun.
Just Cause 2 is a fun game! Full of explosions and fun!A must have game
Amazing! If you dont mind the swearing and the humour...
Fun :)
A very good survival game 8/10
I've played 45mins and loving it already! Great Job!
Its free, and is fun with friends (with mics)
In my opinion, Portal 2 is the best Puzzle game of 2011. In addition, the co-op campaign provided some humours one liners from Cave Johnson.
