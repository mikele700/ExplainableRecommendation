Its fun
One of the best survival games of all time. Decided to buy it, wanted to play for a bit around 2 hours had passed.Great Game
Amazing game with good story and amazing soundtrack. You will not regret purchasing this.
Horrible completely unplayable on mac. My mac meets the requirements but whenever i get near to another person i lag out so much so i switched to an aussie server and i had 20 ping but still lagged. Another problem is that the sound is all broken up.I wish for a refund. This game is ♥♥♥♥!!!
Hat Simulator
I was ♥♥♥♥ed up the ♥♥♥♥. I regenerated because my ♥♥♥♥ was ♥♥♥♥ed up.Got to night 4 never playing this againWasn't ready for freddy.....Please make this for mac. Please it would make my day.
I was an English Queen, fighting Gandhi, who discovered Atomic Bombs in 1500 and made Christianty 1000 years before Christ.Yes
