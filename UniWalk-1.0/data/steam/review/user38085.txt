An awesome game and a must buy when it goes on sale. Why are you reading this? Go play some Skyrim!
The story in this game is great and what you would expect from Telltale. However, the numerous bugs/glitches in this game make it very hard to love this game. It is incredibly frustrating and at the moment I can't see the final cutscenes in the game because it is zoomed in so much you can only see a quarter of the screen. Exiting the game and attempting to change the screen resolution in windows does nothing...Telltales website is equally as pathetic and won't verify my new account so I cannot lodge my issue with their support. I give up...
