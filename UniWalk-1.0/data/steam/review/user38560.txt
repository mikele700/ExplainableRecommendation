Shenanigans
Even COD comes up with new concepts every few years or so.CSGO doesn't feel like a new game it feels like counter strike. It hasn't changed much. Some people may like that but if you are a person that doesn't play 1 game for 10 years then you will probably be underwhelmed. Verdict: If you have never played CS then you can get it. If you played previous version of CS you may get bored.
Uh Eh Uh.I am glad they made a new Thief. I really missed the stealth theft.However it doesn't fell like the old thief games. It isn't EPIC enough. The story is lacking and a bit predictable. The characters aren't that intresting. Gameplay is okay. If you get a good deal and you like steath games then it might be worth it.I gave it a thumbs up because i really want them to make more (and better) thief games.
F****** great game.If you loved the original Thief(s) you will love this game. I actually rate this game higher than the new Thief and i personally LOVED the old thief games. Greate gameplay and story.......i recomend getting the knife of dunwall DLC and the Brigmore Witches DLCOnly downside is the number of missions is low but even then worth every penny.
City Builder (well really village builder)with a focus on BALLANCE. You have to finely tune your village. Every resource you collect you use internally. If you liked any of the original Settlers games you will probably like this
good, fun remake of the original.For those that have played the original it's worth the nostalgia. Be warned that it has been simplified (it's been made more mainstream)
