It took me barely 2 weeks to get 100 hours on cs:go......Oh yeah, and I made $10 in a week, more than my parents ever gave me.
Great game and is a very well balance first person shooter that includes teamwork, skill and fun.Also, I hate the outdoors now for some reason.
Excellent FPS that perfectly resembles a global war however you will need a very very good computer to handle this.
