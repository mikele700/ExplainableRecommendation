Hope this game continues to be on top. Everyone I knew plays a different game, wish they'd come play TF2 again. :'((PS. please ignore my play hours!
Great game of my late great great grand dad.Played it since birth, just can't remember a thing. I launched it on my new PC and played like a pro for the first time. Nearly got accused of hacking, even tried to vac ban me for using something that isn't harming any player's game.PS. Only one problem we got here and still ain't getting fixed! VAC.
Please keep this game alive! I love it since the first day. Alt-account here ignore my playhours. I really recommend this game! Get it now!
