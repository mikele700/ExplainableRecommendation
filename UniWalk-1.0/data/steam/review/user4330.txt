Borderlands 2 is a rpg, Fps. This game is worth the money but not only is it an fps but quite wacky and bizzare making it one of the most unique and different game of all time. Borderlands 2 contains quite a few dlc that last very long. It also have 3 headhunter dlc which are short and only give out alot of skins and heads for your character.Borderlands 2 has a wide variety of bosses and mini-bosses such as knuckledragger,boom-bewm and captain flynt. Borderlands 2 a great solo game but when friends come on its raid boss time! Raid bosses are tough bosses and usually need a few peopel to defeat. An example is terramorphous, He is a big powerful monster who can wipe you off the map. Some raid bosses are Hyperius, Master Gee, Voracidous and dexidous.Borderlands 2 has a million different types of weapons, Many are found randomly but some 'Unique' weapons which are usually marked with red text saying something about the weapon. Every boss in borderlands 2 drops a unique which you will need to farm for. Farming is when you fight the boss over and over again for his rarest loot. Some bosses only have a 1 in 200 chance of dropping their unique. Raid bosses drop and legendaries. Borderlands 2 is a great game and easily a 9.5 out of 10
Red Trigger was an awesome experience. Its got a mysterious yet intresting storyline, tough but good puzzles. It's also one of the few puzzle games that require timing making the game more unique, interesting and worth playing. I would love to see a concept like Red Trigger become a big game that lasts hours like Portal 2. It's short but only made by one person with a tiny bit of assistance by others. Definintely an 8/10 especiialy because it's free.
If you have patience, this game is great. It's fun to just go onto it every now and again. They add events to add unique content but I recommend it. Easily the best idle game out there, if you prefer an idle game with a bit more action get  clicker heros.
