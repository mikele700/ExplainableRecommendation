Nostalgia/10
This game was pretty darn good! Scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of the at some points which i loved the only down side to it was the controls at first but after a while of playing they were easy to use.the graphics are awsome for its time :P8.5/10
Okay so before i start this very short review i would like to note that though i only have 3 hours in this game i have played roughly 200+ offline in the past, before it was on steam. Also note that i am comparing this to AOE2. Okay so let me start with the plus-'s of this game.+Better Graphics+Bigger mapsThats just about all i can think of for plus-'s.When it comes to the minus-'s i-'d like to think i have a fair comparison when looking back to aoe2 and this game. So this games -RTS- system is probably the most unqiue and bull ♥♥♥♥ excuse for a game under the genre... The games AI is broken as ♥♥♥♥, the level up system is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and dont even get me started about the varity of teams. A small thing that made AOE2 unique was the randomised team names where in AOE3 it uses actual historyical figures to play as, all of which are terribly voiced over. I can-'t stress enough that this game is a watered down yet stale game.I cant recommend this AOE game because it hardly even stands up as an AOE. PS: Yes AOE2 is one of my favorate games.
