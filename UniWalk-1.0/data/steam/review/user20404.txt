Robbing banks has never been so fun.Some heists are down right impossible to solo, at least until you are a much higher level, but the AI can thankfully soak up a tonne of bullets before going down, even if they are near incompetant otherwise.Playing with friends is where this game really shines. Co-ordinating a heist down to the second, then having it all blow up in a moment when a stray guard spots you, while frustrating, can make for fun times.
