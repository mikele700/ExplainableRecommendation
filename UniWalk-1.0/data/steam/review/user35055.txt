This little test gave me an incredible amount of enjoyment. from the begining, after a quick change of the ludicrus mouse sensitivity, i relished in the environemnt eagerly exploring it all with amazing graphics and very fast movement speed to follow with. the puzzles were enjoyable but personally felt very easy although that may be intentional as it is just a test. aside from the the secrets were my favourite part, i wont spoil it but it was exactly what i wanted from that kind of aspect.
