Hopefully we get a sequel. You get to play the game how u like from run and gun to stealth or mixing it up or many more ways.Really enjoyed the game mechanics and how the game plays. Good story and good graphics 8/10
Such a good game from graphics to storyline u can not fault it. The ending is a surprise twist which have u thinking and keep u pondering! Overall 10/10 Hope the bioshock franchise keeps on going :)
