best game ever to have fun and pass the time
Payday 2 is one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life. There is a level of difficulty in it so it makes it challenging, while at the same time making it extremely fun to play! After picking up this game, I have played over 5 days game-time of Payday 2 and loved every minute of it.For anyone wanting a game that has amazing replayability, awesome game mechanics and some of the funniest video game commentary you will ever hear, buy Payday!
