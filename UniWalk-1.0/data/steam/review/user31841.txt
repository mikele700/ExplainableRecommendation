i have played tf2 since 2011 i have had 2 steam profiles both with over 500 hours on tf2 and still to this day i love this game, the game-play is fantastic and you need to work as a team to ensure success but the community is terrible scammers every server and the trade system is terrible a $2.50 keys is worth more than a $17.00 cosmectic i dont see the point of buying cosmetics unless you buy them from the market and not to mention that each update valve makes is like turning tf2 to cs:go and i love cs:go but i perfer tf2 to stay tf2 and i have had tf2 since it was p2p i got mine on the orange box and im not aginst f2p's but many are if you are wearing a gibus and haveless than 10 hours doing terrible people will be thrustraighted and i can admit i do to but you might get yelled at so keep that in mind also.so im giving a thumbs up for the game play. but you if you decided to get tf2 if your a new comer please PLEASE do training befor online i get frustraighted when a person with less than 10 hours comes and is trying to shoot past a glass window so please do training.7/10-for core gameplay
I HAD SUCH HIG HOPES FOR THIS GAME.......but evrytime i loda it up it crashes and it takes way to much space in your computer
-Load game-Play for about 30mins-Bank account at -$50,000-Play for games to earn more money-Gets to the point where im up to -$160,00010/10 would go broke again!!!!
