great fun game, good fun to play with friends...you will indefinately need a mousei would reccomend this for people who are looking for a game to play with friends. if your looking for the real steam experience your looking at it. only one real nit pick, guess it would be the file size, but your looking at a good game, also the maps take a long time to load (dont hate, my internet not that good)this is a great game
Dota 2, where to startThis game has given me many positive and negative memories, the good times. Playing with friends, cooperative teammates, the bad times. Bad connections and foul teammates. If there is one thing this game gets correct is that it helps to teach team work, its almost impossible to win by yourself. Thank you Dota!
