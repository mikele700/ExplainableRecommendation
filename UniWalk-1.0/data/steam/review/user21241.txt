It's a great Military FPS and very balanced for a Free-2-Play. The only issue for me was that in this game your weapons wear out which means you have to repair them once in a while and can often be a bit pricey. And also it is quite hard to grind when you start off.9/10
Great Game but lots of hackers. Go play their other one, Combat arms line of sight. Its improved and apparently very little hackers.
It used to be a great game, it was soo good. But now, the community is just... blah. Hardly any1 on. Recommend only for a fun game with friends once in a while.
