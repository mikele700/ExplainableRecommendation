Great game! Love the concept, i realise that it is still in Beta but i would appreciate it if they could optimize more graphic cards because my Nvidia doesn't run well with Starbound...
I bought this game because it looked like a nice turn based stratergy rpg and because the game play looked fluid and smooth...But looks can be deceiving because it is really hard to get into it, and i find the gameplay is really difficult to enjoy properly.
Amazing game! Game play is smooth and well-designed. Would recomend this to anyone who loves semi-releastic first person shooters.
Very great game! Love it so much. Once you start playing you'll never stop! :)
