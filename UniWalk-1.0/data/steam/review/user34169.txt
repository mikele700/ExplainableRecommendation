This game is hard as balls and as tasty as pudding, if you think you'll like it buy it, because you will.
This game is good why? because it is fun. It is fun because you can play with friends or by yourself, its got a way better crafting system than minecraft and the NPC's fill my lonely little world with artificial life.also magic, this game has magic and its awesome 9/10 would magic again
