I definitely recommend this game. As a matter of fact that is one of the best games ever!! I enjoy everything about it. You can choose from 6 heroes and enter one of the 2 arenas. The rules of the gameplay are very simple, however it does not make the game itself trivial. To the contrary - the game is incredibly complex because of its many variables (being mostly the players themselves). One always needs to look out, cause the situation in the arena is very dynamic and changes every minute. I love that you can loot artifacts in the game, although the green ones need to be unlocked afterwards. THis is not an issue for me. I either do so, or keep the yellow ones on. However I think that the chat needs further improvement. Not only does it look as if drawn by a child, it is somehow difficult to use. But all in all the game is pretty awesome, especially given the fact that it runs even on my old pc (I'm not a pc geek).
