ok i dont write many reviews, but i felt i had to on this one because so many people with under a hour or two keep saying its bad....the game is not bad, the game is near perfect for HITMAN! its the best of blood money and the best of absolution together. Great game very well done.However, my reason for not recommending this game is because of the epicodic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t...come on honestly its basicly a season pass to the GAME itself.Season passes were a horrible idea to make even more money on what used to be patches....now we basicly have a season pass on a normal game....this isnt cool and gaming companies need to stop all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and just release full games with FREE patches...
Short and simple for early access the game is really coming along well and for 15 bucks amazing value even as it is, but i look forward to the progression of this game i think it will be amazing in the future. Great work guys keep it up :)
