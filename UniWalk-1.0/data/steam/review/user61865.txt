This is is a really good game the story line just cept twisting and twisting the multiplayer is great,just the way it plays makes me like the game as well and back to the story if you dont know alot about Batman or Joker this would give you most of there information about them.The multiplayer is good but need to work on a few things but apart from that the multiplayer runs smooth and its just fun to play it with your friends and well anyone.I would recommoned this game to all ages.
