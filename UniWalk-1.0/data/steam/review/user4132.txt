Probably the best game I've ever played, it allows me to relieve certain childhood trauma.
Can you make Snapmap not ♥♥♥♥ so I have a reason to keep playing this game? Otherwise best game of 2016.
Doesn't seem to work properly (crashing in the early stages of the game, not saving right, etc) on Windows 8 and 10.
A very spoogily game
Boring, buggy, repetitive... can't remember why I bothered 100%ing this.
Worth it if you can invest the time and don't mind being killed 3,000 times in a single session.
Praise the Sun!
Not worth it if you own the original + DLC.
