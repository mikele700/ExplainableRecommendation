I've been playing MechWarrior Online for almost a year now. Once you get over the very steep learning curve the game becomes very additive. You can spend hours in the mechlab trying to fit another heatsink or lazer into your mech. Over the year I've been playing the game I've seen it change and improve drasticly. If your still unsure just remember it is free so unless you want to you don't have to pay a cent. See you out thereo7
