Not sure why this game is getting so much hate... Having an amazing time with it.  Exactly what I thought it would be and considering it was only made by a handful of devs, I just want to send my congrats.  Bit bummed about the no joystick support, using my Xbox 1 controller is a bit average, but I'm sure support is coming.  Only glitch I've experienced so far is when I launch off a planet, sometimes I'm shot clear into space.  Other than that, no framerate issues or bugs and I'm 12 hours into it.  People need to calm the f*** down about this game.  Too many idiots that believed all the IGN bs hype.  If you're still falling for gaming websites bs hype, then you deserve to be dissapointed.  WD Hello Games!
