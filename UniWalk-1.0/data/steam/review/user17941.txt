I don't know how I feel about this game. As of now I haven't played very long- but I can say I have enjoyed it.On the one hand it most definitely has some P2W elements, but the starting equipment isn't too bad and it doesnt seem like it takes too long to get up there, and this is coming from a person who fundamentally hates P2W games.The early game is pitted against you, enemies have grenades, tanks, automatic weapons, and all you have is a basic semi-auto rifle. Fortunately I discovered most people in heroes and generals aren't very good and despite the unfair advantages they have over me, I still manage to score reasonably well sometimes.I have only played as an infantry and am rank 5 or so, so dont take this review too seriously.The vehicles are solid and it's good fun to jump on a machine gun while your mate is driving a jeep into a control point. CRACK CRACK CRACK! (the sounds do need some work though.)Gameplay is kind of clunky but no where near dayz or arma2.I would recommend this game simply because it's free. If they made me pay $10 and removed and the pay2win elements, I would accept in an instant. Hell maybe even $20.
Great fun: If you like the Hunger Games- you will love this; if you like battle royale- you will love this; if you like competetive survival games- you will jerk off to The Culling's facebook page eagerly awaiting more info.
Great experience. Best part is the player vs player interactions. They really balanced out the game so that its not a mindless slaughter (looking at you Nether) But is still a pvp game.The player interactions were good fun (when they are not screaming friendly at the top of their lungs while running away.)But the amount of bugs is almost unforgiveable.Currently I have one where every 5 minutes I get 1-5 fps and can barely move. Buildings get low texture quality and when inside one I cannot see the walls nor floor.Once they fix the bugs- truly a worthwhile experience.
