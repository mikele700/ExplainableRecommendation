For an early access game, Lego Worlds sure shows a lot of promise!Each world you play is randomly generated and shows you where you spawn, but there is so much more of the world for you to discover. The worlds consist only of lego bricks - you can delete just about every brick and place most -simple- bricks (e.g. 2x4 bricks) in any colour you want, but no specialist bricks (e.g. flags) can be placed. Hopefully the ability to place these specialist bricks will come out in the near futureAs you play your Lego World, there are different objects, such as plants and cauldrons, that you unlock by paying in studs you can earn from destroying these objects, allowing them to be placed. Furthermore, there are npcs that you can unlock to play as, as well as using their clothes to create a custom character. There are also animals and vehicles that you can ride, which also must be unlockedThe camera is quite good when walking or riding around, but when building, it is not very precise, and difficult to line objects up. i have also encountered a glitch where shift+tabbing out stops me from moving the camera angle.Building in the game could possibly be a bit better, perhaps more akin to the controls of lego digital designer, and as mentioned before, the camera prevents accurate block placement in many instancesCurrently the game has no set objectives and also has little in the way of models and items. However, the current items and models are very detailed and useful, and I am sure that there will be hundreds of more exciting models that will be able to be placedUltimitely, the game has an array of exciting features and unique worlds, and is priced exceptionally well. Although some of the controls are a bit finicky, I am sure as the game develops further controls will be streamlinedThis game is definitely a good buy if you are interested in the world building genre, and obviously if you like LegoPros-Exciting and unique worlds-Great prebuilt models-Npcs that you can dress as-Vehicles and animals are fun-Movement controls are excellentCons-Camera can be a bit dodgy-Building is not always precise-Lacks a large amount of models and objects (but being early access there will be more added, so this point will be pointless in the near future)
