STOP MAKING SUCH HUGE MAPS WE WANT SMALLER ONES
id like to think this game was a shooter but sadly it turned out alot like Postal 2
this game is basically a re do of noughts and crosses
Basically a clicker heros update
horrible
Left 4 Dead 2 is already in your Steam library
Very nice game very nice. A whole bundle of fun for you and your friends. Defenitley worth every cent could have purchased a better game
