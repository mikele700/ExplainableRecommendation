This game is as good as they say! The people in the game have a different language like in the Sims but this makes you focus more on the game and you can still understand the people through body language and expressions. The story is great and I can't wait to finish this one :DHas controller support too! ^_^
It really is a surreal horror experience! :OJust a piece of advice guys always wander around at day time and gather materials cause the first time I played I didn't and I just wandered around my house thinking on how to improve it and stuff before long I haven't noticed that night time came so I pretty much didn't survive that one hahaha Currently on Day 5, Perma death is turned off but if you think you're a bad ♥♥♥ and can survive a long time, turn Perma death on and feel the pressure of the game O_OGood Luck Surviving! ~TK-575
A really good game, especially when they added the feature where you can teleport to your home planet when you are anywhere in the galaxy which makes adventuring and exploring really comfortable and enjoyable! Multiplayer rocks as well |m/Still in beta but it's pretty good and enjoyable :DDD
