Counter-Strike: Global Offensive... CS:GO.... How do i start this review hmmmCounter-Strike: Global Offensive in my opinion is and probably for a long time will be one of the best FPS game's on steam...I have sort of a love hate relationship with cs:go for reason's such as- You meet some very nice people on their +1In competitive matchmaking you usually have a tonne of troll's and or teamkiller's -1In all gamemode's you have little twelve year old kid's complaining and calling hack's everytime they get killed -1You can get awesome weapon skin's and knifes <3 +1Very overpriced Weapon Skin's and Knife's -1The community of CS:GO is generally nice and  competitive matchmaking can be very fun if the team work's together instead of just killing eachother +1Over-all i would have to rate CS:GO a 8/10
Whilst everyone else was slaughtering eachother on a chaotic battlefield, I found a bike and i knew what my mission was, I rode around the whole entire map like 10 times dodging gun shots and grenades, 10/10 Great bicycle maneuvering simulator
One of the best game's i have ever played and will be for a long time, The gamemode's on Garry's Mod are endless and always updating with more and more, This game has everything for all age group's and intelligence, Wether you just want to Minge around on server's or get into some hardcore roleplay this game has everything10/10
IMHO: The original Soldier Front was and is alot better then Soldier Front 2 and i know im going to get alot of hate for saying that but honestly, Alot better Menu and navigation around the menu, Alot less money hungry, More Gamemode's, Better Maps, Much less twelve year old's....
