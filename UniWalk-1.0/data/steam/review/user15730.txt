Really enjoyable game, would love to see a comp scene for this game. Keep it up devs :D
Alright, so i just got this game, my first thoughts where that it had a great community and nice people, it took me all of 20 hours to figure out how truely bad the community was. Every game there is either a hacker or a ♥♥♥♥ talker. I would not reccomend this game unless they seriously fix there anti-cheat.
Started a single player game, says -waiting for other players- - Uninstall works great!
