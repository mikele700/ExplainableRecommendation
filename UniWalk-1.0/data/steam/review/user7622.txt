This game looked simplistic and somewhat boring in the store page screenshots, however this is not the case. The puzzles provide a pleasant balance between challenge and fun, and the story, if you choose to indulge it is very interesting!
This game reminds me of the 'spacebuild' addon for Garry's Mod. From what I have seen so far this is a fantastic game and I would definitely recommend to someone who likes open-world/sandbox/suivival/role-playing type games.
This grandma is bad-♥♥♥!
