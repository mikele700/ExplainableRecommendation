Buy it immedieatly, mostly because it's dead so you guys will keep it alive, but for it's fun gameplay, and did i forget to mention the game is repopulating again?
Pros:Can be fun at the begginingYou're a goat and you do anything you wantNot bad graphicsCons:This game ♥♥♥♥ed up my computer (it says i'm in game all the time and can't end the process)Gets boring easilyYou will get low fps Just badIf the developer could fix the game and make it cheaper so you don't have to pay 10$ for this crap that would be great
i'm in love
The 3rd game i joined had a hacker that got my rank to 70 and 10th prestige, but since then. No hackers, rage awaits you in this game, so you must get goodPROS------------ Very ♥♥♥♥ing fun- The best call of duty (exepct call of duty 4 and 2)- Just funCONS----------- Noob tube- Campers- Trying to get nuke rage- Many players having better weapons than youNow that hacking is patched i think this game will be alot of better9.8/10 too much noob tubers
