I sleept with all the hot women of the village in chapter 1 11/10 would do it again.
Fallout 3 is one of the best game worlds i have seen. The atmosphere, The story. It's a very good game although like most bethesda games there are crashes. Along with the windows 7 and 8 optimization. But there are fixes which may or may not work like for me all i had to do is install windows game live and i could play it. but overall the best story and lore i have seen. dan ouda dan (10/10)
