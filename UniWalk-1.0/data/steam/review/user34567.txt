I've only played this game for about 20 minutes just because I intend on doing a co-op series with another YouTuber. But just in that 20 minutes (That being an 8 minute clip and 12 mins worth of gameplay) I can assure you this game is astonishing. Its hilarious storyline and unique art style help to amplify the point of this game being one worth the money in your steam wallet. I would recommend this to anyone and anything (that includes pigeons even though those things I can't stand....friggen pigeons mayne...hate those things) 10/10
Playing as the Penguin genuinely makes me upset....will it ever score more then 20 points?
