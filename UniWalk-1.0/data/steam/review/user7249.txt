Pros:- Includes whole Half-Life campaign for free (Thanks Valve!)- Crap ton of playermodels so you can be a mushroom & stuff- Massive support for community-made content (Game is full of custom maps & theres even a whole website dedicated to making them)- Most of the older bugs have been fixed- Still uses VAC despite being mainly a co-op game- FreeCons:- They changed the original viewmodels to very out of place and inconsistent ones- A few maps of the Half-Life campaign were changed drastically (only a few, so it's ok I guess...)- Buggy as hell- Player collisions- You can set off a nuke in one of the HL1 campaign maps (Causing the map to keep restarting...)- Servers with over 8 people will most likely break the game depending on the map- Cutscenes screw up voice chat and make everybody sound like robots- Voice chat quality is not very good compared to current games- FreeOverall:Epic, very buggy and theres heaps of things that need to be changed but still a very good mod.Hope they port it to Mac soon!
It's ok
Pros:- Skins- You get to shoot baddiesCons:- No cs_estate.9.2/10, good game.(400+ hours and still unranked)(UPDATE: 600 hours and Nova 1)
