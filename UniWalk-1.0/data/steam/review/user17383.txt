  This game could be quite fun to play when you played it long enough.It is like a real survival zombie acopolypse game where you control a person who is not even ready for that to happened  The bad things about this game is that it doesnt shows your health,as if the character doesnt know how fit and well he is.The infection is too hard to cure,even when eating pills,you will only have a limited time to survive.  This game could be hard to many players like me when you do not know the controls,or what to do in survival mode.The first time I played it,I did not find it so fun but once you know how to handle the zombies,it could be a intresting game to try
