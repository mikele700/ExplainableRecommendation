SUPER EPIC AND AWESOME!
Excellent game, very realistic and adds toughness to simulate real life encounters. Highly recommend to use a control for this game as it does require high level of co-ordination, and it also has to be very quick.
Fun indie game to play with friends. It has good mini games to add on to the fun. Really cool theme  and a 8/8  from me.
Epic and crazily addictive!Intense game modes but also fun with friends!Excellent weapon skins, stickers and items with exquiste design!A must-get for action lovers!
