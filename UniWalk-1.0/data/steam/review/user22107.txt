Good Hunting game, better then those things at the pub!
Amazing game but suffers from lack of support, not taking more onboard from the community.This game will be alot better once support for Mods is added, and the community can make the additions they have been waiting for.

Finally, ive found something worth playing on Arma 3, check out Altis Life if your into Roleplaying as it is by far one of the best Mods out there and requires no downloading what-so-ever, if your looking for all out war, Wasteland is where its at and also requires no downloading of Mods and can be accessed simply by Filtering in the Server Browser for Wasteland Servers.10/10!!!
