My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, -If you ever want to see your grandchilderen graduate, you have to stop immediately.-'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realised exactly what was at stake. He gave up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- -'Don-'t ever smoke, don-'t put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.- I agreed. At my age, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
