Okay, after a couple of hours playing this game the first thing you have to understand is that it is extremely hard to play with the keyboard and mouse. However, after 30mins of tweeking the key bindings I have finally made it playable. ITS IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY. May take some getting use to though.
