This game is a very unique game with both first person and third person gameplay. It does feel like world of tanks but the only minecraft consepts in it is the first person creating and the blocks ( but almost all games have blocks in them) so its not at all like minecraft.You Make 1 of 3 types of robots; a Car or tank, hover and flyer or a combernation. Personaly i find it easier to make and use a car but everybody is better at others. The creating is at first person view which makes it quite easy to create your robots. You can buy more items to create your robot in the store. Once you are done you have 2 options; Battle or Practice. Practice is a mode where you can freely use your robot around a well disigned map. Their are all three combinations of robots you can battle to test your robots power with its guns. After you have finished testing your robot you can go to battle and have team battles online to gain money and level up.Over all a very good game and worth trying out on your own or with a friend.
So fun to play with or without friends... GET IT!!!
