My family always seemed to look down on me simply because I wanted to explore and experience the magic and culture of nippon (that-'s japanese for Japan). They always tried to get me involved in more -western- attractions like theme parks and shooting games. This used to bother me, but after discovering HuniePop I realized that I was not alone. There are thousands, no, millions of people like me who prefer the 2d to the 3d. I truly believe that the paradigm of beauty has shifted and that the 2d is slowly starting to become more mainstream. Unfortunately, not everyone can be as open minded as I am (atheist, like all sorts of music but mostly jazz and indie-pop). These people are trolls and haters who try to make me and people like me feel horrible for being who we are. They say that watching 2d sex videos is weird, but I know that I am allowed to be who I want. I also identify as a half wolf (I prefer to be alone, and value intellect over all other things in the material world. But enough about me, here-'s my review.PROS:-Lots of pretty anime ladies-2D-Realistic simulation of romance (I mean true romance not the fake love that you experience with 3D girls, who think that they-'re better than everyone else)-Let-'s you meet likeminded gamersCONS:The only con that I can think of is that it doesn-'t let me fully customize my character as a half demon wolf-boy. 10/10 I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves Highschool DxD
