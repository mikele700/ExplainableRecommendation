Trading simulator 2015. Let's see. I've spent over 500 hours trading, only around 100 actually playing the game. Let's say something drops every hour. Let's say that'll be 490 weapons and 10 cosemetics. That's around 245 scrap+130 scrap=375 scrap, or 39.66 refined.That is around 4 keys, at 10 refined per key (used to be 5 ref when I started). I've also spent a key to get premium. My backpack is worth 190 refined, or around 19 keys.I've spent 6 keys on Total War Shogun 2, 4 keys on Fall of the Samurai DLC for the same game, 2 keys on Empire Total War and 2 keys on Deus Ex Human Revolution. In total that's 28 keys I've made (including the deduction of 4 keys from drops and 1 key to start with). You know how long it would take to make that under the minimum wage here in Straya? 10 hours at most.
Good story, decent gameplay and some thought-provoking themes. Get the Director's Cut as its the closest thing to a GOTY edition. The commentary was really insightful.
This game is amazing. It's worth investing your time in. It's hard but don't be deterred. The game no longer receives updates though, and people complain about the developers. Honestly I don't see anything bad about them, as their goal is to make money, like other companies, and they've moved on to focus on Smite, they main money grabber. At least this game is free to play. I'd reconmend playing on servers with ping less than 100 since most projectiles are not hitscan.
