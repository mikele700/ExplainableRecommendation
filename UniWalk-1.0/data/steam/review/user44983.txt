This game has possibly the BEST storyline I have come across in ages!!! I still have no idea what happened!!!
Such a sick game. It does involve a lot of orc hack and slash but it does it soo well and the various ways you can take orcs out is fantastic. Would definitely recommend
Great game, fun for players with high skill level and for beginners. The game is completely balanced in the sense that the only advantage frequent players have over new players is their knowledge and skill. Very addictive
