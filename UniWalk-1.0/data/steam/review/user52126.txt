Papers Please is one of the most unique and interesting games you can find on steam, not only is the gameplay addicting and interesting but the overall storyline, endings and possible outcomes make this game a must have. This game also has incredible replayablilty making you just want to keep playing it over and over again to either get better, waste time or find all the secrets. Another outstanding fact about this game is how much it makes you question what sort of person you are, will you do your duty to your country and do as they request? Or will you let in people who want to get in to escape their horrible past? Overall this game is definetly a 9.5/10 from me.
