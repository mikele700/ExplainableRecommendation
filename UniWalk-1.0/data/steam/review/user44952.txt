Space ponies!Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion by far in my opinion, is the best RTS game i ever played, in terms of gameplay, graphics, empire building, all are good, got to love the galatic fleet battle parts as well as seeing your fleet get smacked from all directions.Its also quite challenging if you play with others alongside, spices up the heat of the game.11/10 will recommend.Best RTS game i ever played.
