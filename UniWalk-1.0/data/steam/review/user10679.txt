The price may be intimidating, but regardless this game is amazing. Whether or not you want to pick this up though, is your choice. Even in early-access this game is relatively bug free, haven't run into a single one, Yet not all content is there yet. WARNING: This game does not mess around when it says 'brutal'. Normal enemies can one shot you if you have low defence. Be prepared.
Hotline Miami can be summed up in one word. Brutal. However, the act of knocking someone over with your fist and bashing their head against the floor is actually quite satisfying. You get a rush that is not only invigorating but scary when playing this game. Hotline Miami's difficuly level is quite high as well, and needs you to plany ahead to gain any ground against your opponents. Overall? Good game.
