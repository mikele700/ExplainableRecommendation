Childhood is this game. A classic, never gets old. A MUST BUY.
Makes one of the best games of all time co-op. Love it!
This game is one of the BEST sandbox building games I have played since Terraria or Minecraft. Even in beta, the game is so fleshed out an full of variety in everything. Characters items, Weapons, Creatures, Building Blocks, NPCs. You name it, Starbounds got a 100 different variations of it. A must have game if you dont mind that its not finished and is still changing!!
I used to have this game on my old samsung omnia windows phone. Always loved it! Please bring it to android and iOS!!
