So I originally preordered this game for the Silent Hill 2 feelings the trailers gave me, Having played through twice I can say I was pretty satisfied with both the purchase and the assessment.It’s short game (takes a little over three hours once you’ve got the puzzle solutions down,) but I enjoyed the story and the puzzles. While my second playthrough started to hit some glitches (mostly just Joe sliding around the screen when I attempt to open doors, nothing that impacted actual game play or story) and I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out what to vary in actions to change my ending, I’d certainly recommend others buying this.The indie source shows in a lot of the voice acting audio and some of the artwork in close up scenes, but it's nothing I can't live with.The Voice acting may drive people some people up the wall because I know some people really can't stand any issues with voice audio quality, but I will say it's improved immensely since The Cat Lady. So if you could put up with the recording issues there, you'll probably be just fine with this game.I'm certainly looking forward to more work by this developer.
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,I'm stuck in Clicker Heroes, and time keeps draggin' onBut that DPS keeps a rollin' on toward a trillion..
