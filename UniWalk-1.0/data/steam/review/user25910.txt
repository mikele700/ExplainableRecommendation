Pretty much your typical, 'sempi be my wifu' kind of vibe, which i dont inparticular mind. the big deal is that the 'story' could have gone in so many differnt directions, yet it is braught to an abrubt end.  I would very much like to see a sequal for both entertainment and for my closure issues.
This game has the most single best story line I have ever played/whitnessed. the hole consept is perfect and the gameplay is stunning.
