Cardhunter is the crazy love child of the 80s boardgame Heroquest and a simple card game.  The name is slightly misleading as there is no card collecting.  Cards are made available through many hundreds of items.  Deck building is done by equipping items to characters like any other D&D inspired game.  But unlike other D&D inspired games, the effectiveness of each item depends on how it synergises with other items.  An item with powerful cards will be balanced by also containing a number of weak cards.  All items are available for free and will drop randomly just by playing the game.  Many of the Steam reviews suggest this game is pay to win.  This is simple not true.  I became a top 10 player without spending a cent*.  I have seen some rich players dropping hundreds of dollars to fast track their item collection.  But you cannot buy any specific items.  So money gives them very little advantage.  Any seasoned player in the world chat will tell you the same.  You must grind your way to the top and this is a good thing.  The match making system makes use of Elo ranking, and will prevent you from playing against an experienced player that will definitely win.  Ignore the negative Steam reviews.  Instead go read the positive reviews on Kongregate - http://www.kongregate.com/games/bluemanchu/card-hunter/comments?sort=best*After a thousand hours of gameplay I did purchase content, but only to support the developers.
