Real of the Mad God was a great game to play with friends, battling mobs, completing dungeons and getting destroyed by demi-god bosses. It was an amazing game back in the day, making guilds and earning fame towards it gave higher ranks in the guild. Recently over the past year, in opinion the game has declined due to in-game purchases that allow you to get high level weapons and other items that make the game pointless. I see the fact that making money off a game is necessary in some aspects but, buy to win?. The thought of just spending 100 or so dollars on a game to get high level ♥♥♥♥ is quite rediculous. It should be game where hard hours of level up and gaming should be rewarded with high level equipment. The leveling and characters make the game enjoyable, different classes that are aquired when levelling is a great way for more hours in the game making it much more fun. I also enjoyed fame system where even after max leveling has some sort of goal towards the highest fame title. The game is good but needs some areas of improvement like the shop having high level items and the use of money for more ♥♥♥♥.I don't recommend this game to people who dislike buy-to-win games but, it had really good aspects of a good game.
