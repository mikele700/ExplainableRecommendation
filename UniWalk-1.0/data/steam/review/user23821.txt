Very strange but well-made adventure. Alien babies look like apples, apparently. 'Cept for the squiggly limbs of course. Don't eat apples with legs or whatever, because they are acutally aliens. 8/10 - IGN
This game will take everything you have learnt from other first-person shooters and add so much more. The sheer amount of skills and tactics which any good player must learn in order to succeed is breathtakingly immense, AND if you don't wish to learn anything, and play like it's Call Of Dogshit, then the silver ranks welcome you with open arms! glhf
