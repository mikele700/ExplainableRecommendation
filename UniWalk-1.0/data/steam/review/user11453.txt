What can be said that has not already been covered? If you dont mind your GTA's and Saints Row games and havent yet tried this one then i would encourage you to check it out.Rich story, good character development and a heap of action inbetween. Having said that though, there are and i guess its the same with all games in some form or another some things can be repetitive, chasing down the 100% completion is probably where it suffers the most in this aspect (having even more cars/bikes to purchase would have taken the edge off from the grind) and provided the distraction needed to push through.I have nearly 100 hours on this due to my original save being written over (you know who you are lol) but i did enjoy it enough for the 2nd play through.Definitive edition has it all included and i would suggest making that your purchase rather than going with original and then adding DLC as its all included for the package price, something of which i will not be going through again :)All in all, a very well rounded game worthy of your coins and the 50 odd hours of gameplay on offer!
Not to shabby this one, could be better, could be worse!
Its Age of empires what could possibly be wrong with it 0_o
Stay away from this pile of -steam-ing turd.. possibly the worse game ive ever played..
