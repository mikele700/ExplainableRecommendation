This was an awesome game I greatly enjoyed it and managed to play around for 6 hours before doing the first main mission because of the many things you can do in the world. I highly recommend this game although it may be pricey, it is worth the money. Very engaging story, overall hilarious.

If you like co-operative FPS or robbiing banks, making methshipping cocaine or just being plainbadass this is the game for you!A perfect game to play with close friendsand you might even meet new ones.Here are some tips, if you choose to go stealthalways scout the area for security guards firstand if you wish to dispose of a form of securityguard do not shoot a silenced weapon trust methey can hear it, I recomend equiping your primaryweapon and hitting them in the back of the head,they should instantly fall to the ground, as soon asthey are on the floor quickly answer the pager or thefuzz will appear in about 30 seconds, before disposing of the security you should purchase theCleaner skill to get rid of the body I recomend hidingthe corpse in a dumpster or a vent.Tip 2, don't try be a Rambo and run out into the middleof a croud shootng everywhere you will probably only hitone guy and get downed almost imediately the bestthing to do is to stay in side and when on a full clip slightlyaim out the window and take em' out, then crouch behindthe wall next to the window while you reload.I hope these tips have improved your gaming experienceI hope you purchase this game in the future                                                                                   -Happy Hesiting ىliԵch
