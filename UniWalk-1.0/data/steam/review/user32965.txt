Guess what Terraria and chivalry had a baby, that is King Athur's Gold.Amazing pixel artwork, awesome creative posibilites, great physics. A game with crazy ideas like shield and chicken gliding, suicide keg bombings, getting launched out of catapaults. The fun is endless.this game has a steep learning curve, but that doesnt matter, its still hours of fun.with great gamemodes like capture the flag, take the halls, team deathmatch.Its a great indie game and more people should know about it.
very addictive game, so much fun is to be had with this game
Awesome game, Gta with a twist, Tropical, Desert, Snow Environments. You get a grapple hook!, Even better with mods. Now with a Multiplayer in beta, makes it an even better.
