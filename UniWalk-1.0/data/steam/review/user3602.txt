I personally liked the game, however the building can become quite annoying, for example there’s no easy way to demolish reinforced walls and having to use C4 isn’t particularly that accurate or safe. But RUST is defiantly an outstandingly fun game. the giggles of random stuff of plan stupidity, accidental death and sinking mindless hours into creating, designing, building, planning, scavenging, hunting, crafting and surviving throughout the vast lands to sun rise and sun set. coming along dangerous situations, avoiding death at all cost, making friends and enemies. Defiantly worth $10 on the lunar sale that was recent.      --------------------------->COULD USE MORE UPDATES! <----------------------------------------------                                                                                                  .ASAP.                                                                                           9/10 SUH DUDES
