No More Room In Hell is a teamwork based game, and you need to have reliable team mates to help you. If you are looking for a challenge, try playing it by yourself. The game is a realistic zombie apocalypse, so no crossheirs, no seeing your mates through walls, and worst of all, NO AMMO COUNTER. This game is a lot better than L4D & L4D2, for it's more realistic and forces you to be a team to survive. To sum this all up, I give No More Room In Hell a 10/10. It is a great game to play with your friends, siblings, or even your parents. P.S To make the game feel more creepy play at night. Good luck survivors!
Hands-down one of the funnest games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. It just sucks the game was abbandoned by the devs and nobody plays it anymore. There was alot of fun times playing this game. 10-10; would hide on window ledge and snipe people again.
