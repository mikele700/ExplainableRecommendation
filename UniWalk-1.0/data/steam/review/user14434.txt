Best Dota-like out there ;)
Aside from the very lazy porting this is still one of the best JRPG's on PC.While its just lazy on SE's part most of the problems with the port can be solved with a little modding and tweaking, but we enjoy that right? Cause we are PC gamers ;)Also think before you hit the ESC key xDPorting aside the game it self is still pretty great in my opinion. The characters are great for the most part and I enjoyed the story. Also this version comes with Japanese dabb :DThe big drawback on this particual entry over entries in the seires is its linear nature.Would recommend if you are a fan of the series and don't mind a bit of tweaking.
A tight and competitive FPS. The best multiplayer FPS in my opinion
