Very good game if you know how to play it and if you have patients.Teamwork is what you will need and good internet or a good computer that can handle lag.If this game wasnt laggy and glitchy it would be perfect.
if you want a fun game that never basicly ends i think this is a good funny thing with mod (workshop) and with commands really good
