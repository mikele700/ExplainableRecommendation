♥♥♥♥ MY CARDDDDDDDDDDDDDS (flips table)
although my hours look low do not let them fool you, there is some glitch where multiplayer hours dont show, anyway great game had fun for long 20/10 IGN
I Honestly think that this expansion pack is worth 20$ because I had played the game for 980 hours and was getting quite board, after playing this it was quite refreshing to have a new place to visit aside from the centre and the island which were both fine but over half a year old each and to have new challenges was also quite fun.Pros- New Dinosaurs - New Map- New Challenges- New Features- New ItemsCons- Costs $20- costs $20- Costs $20Honestly if the only problem people have with this expansion is the price the devs should feel pretty proud of themselves and honestly I think they should keep the price point up, it’s not like you need this expansion to play ark and have fun I mean look at me I have 1000 hours and the Devs were sued $40 million USD so they kind of need a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money and making a DLC that costs $20 is a pretty smart and decent way of making money, I wouldn't call the devs 'slimy' for making it cost money I would call them good men because in this time we live in a lesser man would have simply added micro transactions with or without being sued so overall I think this is a decent expansion that you should buy if you like are and want a new challenge.
Anime ♥♥♥♥♥s 10/10
Great game, if you don't have the money or don't want to spend $80 just wait becuase this game goes on sale every other month
Well this game is great.... if you can figure out the patten unlike me who got tones of cash, 5 mill and blew it all on games I thought were good ideas but the game had other opinions.Oh and some of the ♥♥♥♥n cheves are impossable                                  7/10
