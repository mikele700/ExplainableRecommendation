The developers of No Man's Sky promised too many things which mislead many people including myself.A big one of these is multiplayer which told us that it was possible to see and interact with other people even though it was a rare occurence. I bought this game expecting all the things the developers said they would implement into the game but after it was released, many of the main reasons people bought the game for were not present in the final release.
