954 Hours of my life, gone, willing though, great fun but thinking back, why didn't I use those hours to do something else? Met miles through this, and he's a top bloke
I just want more! I can't stop playing no matter how many times the dealer takes a ♥♥♥♥ on my face.MORRRREEEEE!!!!!
Pros:Free flowing movementCons:No spawn protection whatsoever.No team balancing whatsoever.Not recommending it because of the cons.
323 hours, you can't argue with that, this game had me hooked for days at a time, always something fresh to do a few years ago but now it's a bit stale, still a good one.
One of the Best Rockstar games ever, they are completely idiotic to not make a sequel, but it's 2013, they would most likely ♥♥♥♥ it up.
4 Hour games with people rushing your ♥♥♥♥ straight away while you villagers play with their berries, always rely on your late game. Fun.
This game has challenged me like no other, awesome atmosphere and I get my ♥♥♥♥ wrecked, but when you Achieve, you feel like a god.
22 Hours so far, loving the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game, Challanging unlike Mario Kart, best Kart Racer since Mario Kart Double Dash.
124 hours later and I'm still ♥♥♥♥ing playing this, the Deadliest Warrior DLC is unoptimized as ♥♥♥♥, but the main game is still great. Torn Banner finally worked most the ♥♥♥♥ out. Now if they fix the DLC it will be amazing.
