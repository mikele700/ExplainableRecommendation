Been playing this game for 6+ months now. Love the game, addictive too! Recommended for everyone!
Haven't even spent an hour and already hooked! Great visuals and simplistic gameplay. Pretty good game.
Loved the game to bits! Played for two days and got to the end game stuff. Can't wait for an expansion or sequel!
I love this survival game, I play almost everyday for a least 2 hours. A must have game.
Great game! Played it lots of times, enjoyed it so far!
