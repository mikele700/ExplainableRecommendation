nice
i like this game very much so tatical and then there many skin that look good i so enjoy thisbtw nerf pluse
i spend almost 100+ hours on this game there something i learn IS this game take time and effort but finally maybe you only get some credit and not unlock a snigle thing and when you try to grind for a gunin a match i always get kill by 1 shot sniper or a full auto gun and you need to spend alot of gold to just a gun or a attachment finally there something to remind new player1. prepare to rage quit 2.you easily get rekt by p2w player3.gold will cost you much that you want to give up on it
