A 10/10 game and I personally recommend playong with a PS4/PS3 controller over an XBOX controller.Best Software: Input Mapper, no setup or anything just open software and you're done!
For some reason i am able to post a review, but this game isnt in my game library. I used to have it.
The controls are bad, the story is bad and the voice acting is horrible. don't buy this game
highly recommend if you're feeling way too happy
