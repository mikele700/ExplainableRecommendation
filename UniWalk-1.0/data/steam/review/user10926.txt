I would recommend this game because it's surprisingly good at telling a story and is really messed up, but in a way where you want to know Why. Game is short roughly 30 min long and for its price its worth it. The pixel-art style cut scene where very good and suited the game's art very wellI did a play through if anyone is interested (will upload rest of it soon)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFS9OgXsf6
This Game is full of Turky Butt Poop!Don't buy it. PLease. K SHUT DA MOUTH PLZ
After playing this game for the first time (so my review is going of my first impression of playing the game) it was a nice little fun game to play where your main objective is to destroy your competition. The art style suits the game very well and looks awesome! If you wish to look at my first play of the game link is belowhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a35M8zYAjk
This game is made on the unity engine and when you open the game up you are greeted with a very simplestic but nice looking menu.After you get into the game you begin to realise that the aliens don't really look like aliens (imo) but more goulish/zombie like. Then the game is very boring and bland and simple to the point of bordem.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EhY6wrKHYg
