This is a great comeback towards the DOOM series with hours of fun inside of it and a great comeback from the lesser liked DOOM 3. The game had so much in it that the original had.The only thing that i dissliked about the game was the ending but that is forgivable because the gameplay and easter eggs are well done and DOOM was never about story.
love this game. it never gets old
Me Recomend
