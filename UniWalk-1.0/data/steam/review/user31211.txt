Amazing game 11/10Would reccomend a few things though.1. Make sure you have a computer with at least 3Ghz of processing power (Do this by using dxdiag in your run)2. Possibly make trebuchets launch. Looks like its going to be added soon.3. Add multiplayer. Because its just 10x better with friends.Overall you need a really good computer to render the world better and I would strongly reccomend adding the two fetures in otherwise its a less engaging experience for players.Thank you Keen Software House for another great game! :)
Awesome Game !
