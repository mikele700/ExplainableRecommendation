The game is remniscent of the Dungeon Keeper series and provides a slightly nostalgic feel. The graphical style and detailed overworld are quirky and creative but are ultimately overshadowed by the slow placed and repeitive gameplay. A major downfall is in its lack of flexible micromanagment and preset room layots. Players are also prevenetd from changing preset room layouts at the start of each new map which limits creativity and needlesy increases difficult as the treasure hold is always placed close to the entrance (where enemeies enter to plunder your dungeons treasure). Imire does provided a wide range of unique creatures and a interesting team combo feature, rewarding creative team combinations. The storyline also contains interesting aspects. Overall the agme is satisfactory if you want a casual play but is no Dungeon Keeper 3.
