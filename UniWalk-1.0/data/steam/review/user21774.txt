This game had so much potential and is quite a solid LEGO game (if you're into that sort of thing) but I CAN NOT recommend it on the basis that the promised 'Five Armies' DLC has been ABANDONED. Why on earth would anyone want to pay good money for 2/3 of a story? It makes no sense. Warner Bros should be ashamed of themselves, tricking people into paying for a product on the promise that it will be finished later, only to back out of it later on. STEAM should be more honest and label this game as a 'EARLY ACCESS'.
