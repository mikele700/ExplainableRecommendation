UDK.exe has stopped working!!!!This isn-'t really an official review I just want to alert Torn banner studios to a problem that is around and a few people other than me also have. That after 4 hours of fun and awesome gameplay Chivalry now comes up with the message -UDK.exe has stopped working-. Now this is really frustrating i mean i tried the usual: Uninstall then reinstall but of course that didn-'t work. Torn banner please fix. But for the 4 hours of fun that i had playing this game before it crashed. I am going to recommend it and I hope other players have fun playing this game just as long as it doesn-'t crash. :)
