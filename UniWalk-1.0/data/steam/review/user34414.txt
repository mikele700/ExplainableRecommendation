God yeah i would recommend this game haha. Its a well designed game where you have to be tactical rather than running out and just shooting.
Great game, Play it how you see fit ( Stealth or outright murder ) but the only thing is the story is too short for my liking
Pretty good game. They just need to fix a few things when you go into first person shooter mode
