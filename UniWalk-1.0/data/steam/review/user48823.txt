unturned is a great game considering thats its free to play and personaly i like survival games such as rust but i-'d rather play this    free game than playing a ten dollar game. Also Unturned is very creative with the items you can pick up and is one of the best free to play games if not the best survival games i-'ve played in its early stages. But it has some down sides to it, although it-'s in its early stages it has some multiplayer bugs and glitches which makes the game hard to enjoy. Also it doesn-'t have any -proper- servers, i had to get my friends and i to make our own. And i don-'t really like the crafting setup because it is hard to know what to craft and how to make the items in the game. i know this game is still very early and is being made by one guy but hopefully in its complete stages the game will be one of the best survival games out there and will be enjoyed by millions...Good Luck with the game
(I want the guy who develop the game to answer this) will there be a free multiplayer mod or multiplayer servers for the game i think it would be a great idea because noone would hack the game (mainly because goats can already fly in the game thanks to explosives)  anyway it would be appreciated if this is answered
