This game, that i have antisipated for a long time, has soo much more to offer than what i had expected, the music in this game is purely awe inspiring, exploring the galaxy has never felt more satisfying and most of all, it has a strong multiplayer community, so a friend is never far away.as much as this game is in beta, it haas a large amount of content that many other games just lack, but unfortuntly while wearing the 'BETA' badge it still has beta wipes around every 2-4 months, its sad comming back to the game and seeing an update and thinking wether or not to update and loose progress, or update and bask in one of the most well made games out there for under $30i hope that anyone who is reading this either has or will get this amazing game.
