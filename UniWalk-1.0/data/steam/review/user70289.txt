Review 9.5/10Counter-Strike: Global Offencive is a well made game by valve that focuses on teamwork, strategizing and tactics. The game as a whole is really quite good in following those aspects and really shines as a competitive game. Everything is well designed from maps to weapons to skins. Great game highly reccomend for any competetive gamers out there who are into fps games.1v1 me quikscops nly ill shrek u m8 u fink ur so kool but ur a scub ur parents dnt evn lyke u ♥♥♥ bet u havnt evn gotn a tripl yet m9 trn dwn 5 wot
