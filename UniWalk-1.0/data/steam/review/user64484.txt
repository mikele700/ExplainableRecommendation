Haunted a beehive and watched as my friends died before my eyes. Worth.A game full of so many bad situations that you can't help but laugh at.
10/10 would set fire to steam-punk patriots again.
Sound idea but poorly executed. The excitement  felt for exploring the galaxy and discovering new aliens and planets soon wore off after I realised that most of my time would be spent grinding for materials just to keep myself alive. Also worth mentioning is that this game promoted itself upon exploring planets which are unique and different form one another due to randomisation, however randomisation can only get you so far, and without new textures, planets get old real fast. Don't get me wrong, I like the game, and I'll most likely play it when I'm looking for a slow-paced game when I'm feeling stressed out, but I simply cannot justify paying around $80 AUD for this game in it's current state.TLDR: Much too expensive for what you're getting at this point in time, buy it when it's on sale if you wanna check it out.
