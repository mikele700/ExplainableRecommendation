Build something.Crash it into something.Repeat.
Awesome Game. Period.What other game do you know where you can rocket Dead NPC's into your friends vehicles, or fly a TARDIS, or make giant forts that will never last a second against a minigun. Or where you can attach rockets to cars and watch as they fly into the air. Or build a giant hamster ball and keep your friends in there.Also, this game has the best modding community ever. you want something, whether it be Weapons, cars, or more melon textures, There is a 90% chance the workshop will have it.Did I mention you can spawn giant rabbits and let them run riot?
Bloody Brilliant Game.
Nice Fun Game. If you like Minecraft or Terraria then this is definately worth your cash.
To recommend or not to recommend...I chose Recommend. The game has great gameplay and a good community (Not a PVP deathmatch every where you go)But it (at the time of writing this review) is let down by the optimisation issues and high end PC requirements to get the best graphic settings.Moving away from the issues, the gameplay is fantastic, and from those narrow moments where I brave the 2 FPS and switch to Epic graphics (Note, I am running dual 780's) the Island (known as the Ark) is one of the most beautiful environments I have scene in a game.
This game is amazing. You can build rockets. And launch them into space. With little green people to brutally murder in a failed Takeoff.Nuff said.
