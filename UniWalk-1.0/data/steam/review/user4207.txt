This is such a fun game. Dwarfs are stupid. Gold spent on dwarven ale. Diggy Diggy holes. and lots of traps.Love it. 9/10 P.S Thanks Simon from (Yogscast) For doing the voice of AWESOMEDWARF! :D.

I Love the mix of Genres, but my designs are really good and keep being stolen. i haven't found a report button (yet) and i would love to be able to report people stealing my ship designs, because if you've taken a long time figuring the perfect mix to put on a ship, it's great. but someone else just goes and steals it without having to go through all the trouble and it's really annoying. but love the game. 9/10!
