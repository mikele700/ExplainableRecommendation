Many of the problem i've sighted on is that this game product is having too many servers that's deserted and maximum player in only one server, servers that changes from 80- to 400+, servers that blocks Eventful Map, foolish newbie on a local Hard, Suicidal and HOE. But the only possible likeness I found is that without Comrades (Players) close to me, and closer to the hordes  , I could've regret the fate of bringing this game, sure they may fool around, coward away, and even daredevil themselves while having the worst opportunities against powerful Zeds, they've could be the source of my determination, talent, skill.(And for sure one day when KF2 release, please put a perks higher ups for the original KF players, thank you,Tripwire.)

If you don't think you're getting this game...YOU'RE WRONG!
Though awkwardly dysfunctional for Window 7/8 to have for such. It is still stand as the best game for all Omega out there who believes on Adventuring, Courage, Knowledge, Fighting and Choices.Also, old-time music is out on here, a hunch of weirdness comes awaiting, just so you can toy and deep-connecting with, and the Freedom you see fit as either Good Or Evil by your very self.Sometime it is not the wrongings you need to treat, but the cause you need to preserve and uphold. And this is more pure to factions than any others I've ever known101/10
