This is a really good game. With a low price tag and good replay ability with its randomly generated worlds and tons of content makes it worthwhile. With the fact that it is also multiplayer just seals the deal. Its mod ability may be low compared to a power house like “Minecraft”, but it has enough content to compensate, great bosses and events to give a fun challenge, and a large variety of blocks which can lead to many beautiful structures. Also with a large amount of items your gameplay can be changed, between but not limited to: A Melee Tank, A Mage, or a long ranged gun user/bowman, all of which can be mixed up with different items and accessories.
