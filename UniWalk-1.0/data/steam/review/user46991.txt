Step away France, Mirror's Edge just made Parkour its ♥♥♥♥♥.This game is amazingly vibrant and alive, and truly captivates the player with its nice and pretty colours. It's like the sunflower of video games.9/10
If you do not get Skyrim, you are a moron.This game is one of the best A list titles of this generation, with a fantastic story, attention to detail, and most of all immersion of the player.I have finished this game on the PlayStation 3 and decided to get all the bonus DLC in the Legendary Edition for Steam, and I am starting to get through them now. They are also fantasitc and needed editions to the base game.A game no one should miss, and a game that any respectable gamer should have somewhere in their library.9.75/10
Got this game while it was $7.50, and its worth $100.Wow, its simply stunning. Unfortunately I wasn't to excited by all the campaign and stuff since I do own a copy on the PlayStation but it was still good to get a PC copy for such a great price.Would advise anyone to get it! 9.5/10
In a few words?Funnest. Simulation. Game. Ever.
