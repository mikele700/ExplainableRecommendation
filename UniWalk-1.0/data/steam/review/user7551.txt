Got it.  Don't need it.  not sure how to use it. 10/10 
PROS-- decent selection of weaponsCONS-- everything else  This game is a buggy mess and the only thing that works is the uninstall button which does so flawlessly.
Apart from the ending, this is a fun and polished game. It features exellent mapping, improved textures and a car mission.   All and all, this is a great game. #HalfLife3confirmed
there is not much right now but i bet this game will be awsome in the future
Epic story, map layout, textures, veichle missions, characters (list goes on and on). In other words: awsomness
