the game is great the sandbox is good Heck skydiving is more like the wingsuit in just cause 3
It's a good game to be honest But you should watch the RWBY series before playing this game, I reccomend watching until volume 2 otherwise the story won't make sense to you It's still in alpha and the game isn't finished yet so expect more, it's great they brought this to steam!
just like half life 1 but better lighting you can increase field of view have better options to make the game look better the hd pack for hl1 source I don't know how to make the SMG work right the reload sound does not work in hd mode overall it is a enchanced version of the same game also you will want this for HL1 scientist posing in garry's mod not the orginal I would give this game a 11/10 for the better lighting the water doesn't fit in the game without hl2 graphics mods you can make the water reflect everything but I like the water the way it is in this game enchanced water like
this game has a good story where you are a scientist his name is GORDEN FREEMAN doing an experiment when you get to the lab thats all I can say don't want to spoil if the experiment teleports you to xen and fight your way out or have to get out of black mesa and go to xen you have to find out GORDEN YOUR LATE!
