Portal 2, one of the best puzzle games out there. The game revolves around not just tests but chell and the other characters such as, Wheately, GLaDOs and of course Doug Ratman. In the start of the game you awake in a strange room, being told that you are in suspension you go back to sleep. then rudely woken up to the sound of someone knocking on the door. And this is where you meet Wheately, a brittish accented core with a bit of an attitude towards you. but enough ofn the start of the game, lets focus on the gameplay. The gameplay is simple shoot either a blue or orange portal on a white surface and not a black one. but when you get further into the game it gets dark toned really quickly, but i will let you find that out. All in all Portal 2 is a great game if your into your puzzles, it even has Co-op and in didnt even talk about the community maps. There are literally hundreds of them and still counting, if your into a good story, Co-op and puzzles. Then your going to love this game. 9.5-10
When I watched the trailer for the game I was immediately hooked. Then I installed the game.. But what I discovered is that I actually enjoyed the game! It keeps pulling me back. And that's how a game should be!
A mod turned full game.You play as Stanley. A.K.A Employee 427. His job is to push buttons on a keyboard. yeah imagine that for a job. but he discovers that there is no one there, and so the journey begins with a nutty narrator, telling you what to do. but you dont have to listen to him. Say if theres two doors, Narrator says left. but you go right. This game is just a fun little distraction and is worth the money you spend. Amusing and sometimes down right quirky its worth your time and money. 8-10
