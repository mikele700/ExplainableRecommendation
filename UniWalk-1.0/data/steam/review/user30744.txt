Grand Theft Auto is a huge, Gta 4 is no different it has a massive modding community, fun voice acting and charcters Comedic Moments but has underlying core values the way niko protects his family at all cost. fantastic game the only con is it has some replay value with different ending but once the story is done there is nothing else to do. Great Game lots of fun 7/10
Great Game just like the old one but much more satisfiying and some great dlc'ssome maps are to easy
Great game but gets old after 240 hours
