Is now old but still brilliant.
Decent motorbike game but a ridiculous exercise in fustration. Honestly, ♥♥♥♥ uplay. Game is currently covered in ads for DLC not avaliable through steam. Very aggrivating.
Great Fun
80% religious propaganda, 20% achievement hunter bait. 100% unorigional.
this game is a thing of beauty, explosive blocky beauty
