Although being a free game, I do not recommend. To start, the menus are a bit complicated to use due to its interface and support linguistic is not the best because the game is only found in too few languages. The gameplay is not as close to reality which hampers a little gameplay. The graphics is the least but could turn out to be improved. The game as it is, will not be appreciated by car lovers not call them much attention much less cause them to become tied hours to the game.Interface: 6 / 10Graphics: 5 / 10Gameplay: 5 / 10I hope they can improve the game and wish you good luck!
This game is really simple but however addictive. It's good for when you do not have much time and you have nothing to do. It's a funny game.Interface: 7/ 10Graphics: 5 / 10Gameplay: 8 / 10I hope to continue with the good work and surprising the players with new content, it is missing the game, new things.
No doubt recommend this game, is really fun and you can spend a good time -clutching- to the game.Interface: 8 / 10Graphics: 8 / 10Gameplay: 9 / 10I really like this game!
Despite the many negatives such as graphics, gameplay, game bots and the database, taking all these negatives into a free play game is good to spend time, from time to time.Interface: 7,5 / 10Graphics: 6,5 / 10Gameplay: 6 / 10It's not a bad game.
