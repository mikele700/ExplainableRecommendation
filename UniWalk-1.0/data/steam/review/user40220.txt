Armor and Wepone treadmill running on a P2W model.A real a shame for people like me looking for a tactical shooter that isnt a another run and gun Cod game.
This Game has potential but lack a community feel ProMostly Free with decent business model.Closest you can get to Mtg without playing and arm and a leg.1 mythic 2 rare and 3 uncommon rule make it less p2w than original magic.Growing card collection with every expansion.ConsNo form of communications with other players.No android Support.No Cross Platform Support with accounts being restricted to that platform.A lot of missing cards from each expansion1,2,3 rules does take away from the original mtg experienceOnly 2 game modes.Many bugs and the game is rarely updated.Deck builder has limited search features.Overall I would say not to throw money at this game as I have no confidence in the Dev to address any of the cons.I feel this game will always be restricted on how good its allowed with fear of being better than real magic or magic online. This game seems to be a half hatred attempt to bit at the heels of hearthstone without trying hard enough to beat it.
