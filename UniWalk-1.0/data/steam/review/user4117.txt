Well im probaly not the first to say this but.....BEST FPS GAME IN THE WORLD!!!!!!The reason I like it so much is because its orginal unlike some of the other FPS games out there. You dont even have to fight you can just go around the map exploring and finding new things. There is also so many taunts like the Conga , High Five and many more. There are also so many weapons to be found like the Pain Train , The Classic and so many more weapons. There are also so many hats that are really cool! Get this game by the name of Team Fortress 2 it is the best FPS out there1000000000000000000/10
