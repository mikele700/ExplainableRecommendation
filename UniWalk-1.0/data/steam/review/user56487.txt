The Forest is the best game i have played in a very long time! Being in Beta 0.01 it is very smooth and playable for hours on end.There are a few expected bugs at the moment where the game randomaly stops you from building, but other then that the game is very enjoyable!This is now my #1 most recommended game of 2014
