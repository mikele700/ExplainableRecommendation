Where to begin with Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I'm going to keep it short. It has been around for ages, has the best tactics and teamwork in steam, but the community isn't always the best. It is also NOTHING like other FPS games. You can't just install, join a match and expect to win. Your aim will be off, you will spray at the enemy and miss nearly every shot. But that is why i love CS:GO. You spend time and time mastering the skill, the weapons and the maps. It is definatley my favourite game and always will be. Overall, wheather you like CS:GO or hate it, I think every player would agree, CS:GO is fun and enjoyable. Why would you play a game that isn't? That is why Counter Strike: Global Offensive has, and will be the best game ever!        :3
