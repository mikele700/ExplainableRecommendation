This is a game that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the FPS, shoot-em-up, looting style genre. The content is packed with witty and memorable characters who forge the storyline to be one that you won-'t forget. Endless hours can be put into the game once you buy some DLCs and is especially more enjoyable to play co-op with friends. As well as the combat system being excellent, the skill tree allows you to customise your character in many different ways. As well as earning skill points, -badass- ranks are another aspect of the game which allows you to improve your character-'s stats even further. I would recommend to absolutely anyone. 9/10
