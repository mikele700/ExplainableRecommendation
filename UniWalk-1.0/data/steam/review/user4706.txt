Great game, sadly the servers are quite buggy and some gliches this is expected in an Early Access Game, I love the graphics and the map(s). It is fun to free roam around the maps even without any idea of where you are going! This is a great game and would definitely recommend and have already to two of my friends. :D
Awesome game! Great job!
