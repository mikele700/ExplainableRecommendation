this game is the ♥♥♥♥. And by that i mean that it is frEAKING AWESOME
Solid new update. Only problems: I can-'t play offline with bots (if this is a feature go back please I loved that mode), and the -Find Game- button doesn-'t do anything! I tried sitting patiently, spam-clicking it, and all other manner of things and it refuses to give me a game. Moreover, I can-'t acess my server list. What is happening, and how do I fix it?
