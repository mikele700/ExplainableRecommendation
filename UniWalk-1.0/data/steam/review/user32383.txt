Great game, Worth the money!This game is awesome and allows you to actualy work together with your team. There are a few PvP game modes along with and number of co-op one's aswell. This game would be an easy 9/10 and i would say to anyone who is into this genre of games or has come from Arma and looking for something more close quarters to get this game.
what the ♥♥♥♥ just happened...
It can be fun with friends but...In genral it is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that you would expect it to be in an alpha/beta stage. The pvp is fun until you realise that you are firing rubber bullets + the person taking all of those nerf gun shots is taking a whole bottle of tablets and magicaly healing themself... I would only suggest to buy this game when it is around $5 or less because it just is not worth the money for the game it is.
