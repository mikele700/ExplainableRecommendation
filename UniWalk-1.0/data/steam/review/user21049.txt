The game is criminally bare bones with nothing to offer for casual fans.Survival is the only mode to speak of (-Story- doesn-'t count) and it has been artifically made more difficult to make it impossible for even pros to beat on HARD. Colors of costumes sit behind completion of these modes hence why they are so difficult. Capcom will introduce the ability to micro pay for  the colours soon enough.Capcom have made characters / uniforms -earnable- in an upcoming update but with the outragiously low earn rates  they have essentually made all items in the game forevermore microtransactions.Addendum.Capcom have not improved on multiplayer game play, rage quitting abounds.They have introduced the ability to micro pay for the colors behind the artifically hard survival mode, as i predicted.SFV + all current DLC will already, six months in, cost you $250.Fight Money is still criminally hard to come by, and DLC being introduced is only purchasable via real money, rendering fight money quite useless.
3deep5you and the reason steam refunds exist.
Man the crushing inflated character progression designed to get you to buy VC is horrible, this is gaming in 2016 :(
mobile port, yo!
The job done on this port is incredible. Mad max is beautiful with an incredible arrary of display options.I-'ve only scratched the surface of this game so far but i have done it with a huge grin on my face, looking forward to battling through the wastelands with Max Rockatanski.PS Maxs had a son, not a daughter, why bother changing that?...and it-'s pronounced -Dinky DYE- not dinky dee, it-'s a popular Aussie terminology. How do you manage to make an entire game, and a throw back to a popular scene, without knowing some cultural context behind it.
