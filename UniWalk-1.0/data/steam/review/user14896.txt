uninstaller simulator 2016 - 10/10 would ininstall again
got 25 hrs in about 4 days of having this game....15/10 would give up sleep again
best cod ever, havent had one problem yet, people are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ going on about how their pc is the best and cost so much and it crashes for them, they just need to fix a fix and shut the ♥♥♥♥ up no one cares
i think this is fun i played it when it first came out on steam abd played it once but i found it to hard but now i played it with my controller i find it a bit easyer but its good for its price range but i dont see why people hate it so much dont take there word for it for all we know they might be people that expect lots from one game just google and youtube around this game and then see for your self i never take other people oppions all the time, but over all its a good game
