Great game! If you want to play with friends or just random people you still can enjoy the game alot. It became really fun after i spent a little money, this resulted in me getting better weapons and trying to improve my characters looks with hats and miscs. Over all great game!
Good game, There are plenty of different gamemodes to suit everyone's taste. I personally love prop hunt, TTT and Jail break but there are heaps of other gamemodes with plenty of active player's and nice admins. Not to mention that in sandbox mode you can do whatever the hell you want. :)
