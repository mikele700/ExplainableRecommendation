Gone Home is a great game about exploration and light puzzles solving with an engaging and emotional story that is definitely worth a play. I have to say that many people don-'t consider this a -real- game because there is no combat or any form of traditional fail state. I believe that that is a narrow minded way of thinking and can only serve to restrict the experiences you can have playing games.
