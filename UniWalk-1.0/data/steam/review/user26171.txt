It's a great game... When it works.I've lost over over 400 days of Premium due to bugs and glitches which prevented me from playing, with no compensation (Not that I tried, I'm too lazy). The game used to crash on loading screens for a good 2 minutes, and by the time I got into the game I was either dead or the game had finished. Including that bug, it's extremely hard for me to get into the game itself, it gives errors and everything.The anti-cheat system is probably worse than a potato..There are bugs which allow people invisible to you to kill you (This IS a bug, not a glitch!), and another that allows people to shoot THROUGH THE WALLS.The game is still in Alpha, however surely these should have been fixed, instead off adding some missile launcher?If there weren't as many bugs, I'd love this game, however most of the time it's impossible for me to play.
