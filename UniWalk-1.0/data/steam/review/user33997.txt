Just Cause 3 was my most hyped game of the year ( I've never like fallout for some reason) and to be honest it lived up to my expectations. I feel bad for the people having issues with this game as my mediocre system runs Jc3 with the occasional frame drop/stutter. I believe this game is a worthy successor to Jc2 and my definate GOTY
Best plane related game ie ever played!! Good graphics and realistic physics.
Epic game! If you get bored, change class or server!! I will never stop playing this game, and its free!!
Awesome sandbox game. A few glitches but no game's perfect. Worth the money!
