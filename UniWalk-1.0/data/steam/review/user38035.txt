Ignore what veryone else says. Start off right there.I played the first Wolf when it was new. I played each as it came out. I was a total ET nut. Went back and had a look recently, was pretty sad. It-'s a ghost town folks, don-'t do it.Anyway. What can I say about this game? It-'s excellent. Plain and simple. A brilliant follow up to RTCW, a brilliant fun romp through a very well thought out and indeed terribly bleak alternate world, where the /whatif is -What if the Nazis won?-As a history buff, it-'s definitely something on which I-'ve thought quite a bit, and if you ever wondered yourself, well son, I think you-'ll find this a pretty good attempt at capturing what could have been, albeit with a little kazz thrown in, but we-'ll call that artistic license shall we?Do yourself a favour, get you some of this, and don-'t forget to do both paths.
