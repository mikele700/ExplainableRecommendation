Right now this game is inferior in every way to the original Rome: Total War. CA are working on various fixes to the AI and performance, but if it's anything like Shogun 2 it will take at least another year, or possibly 2, to fix this game. Do not pay peak price for this.
Edit: I have only played for one hour, so take that into consideration. I will play this again and write a proper review laterThe game has a pretty rocky start. I found it difficult to follow the tutorial and the initial storyline was strange and at times comical. Despite this, the game has nice graphics and it looks like there are detailed 'character customisation' elements to the way you can upgrade your ship, choose your own officers, and learn the usual skills and perks.My initial impressions of this were bad because I wasn't expecting an Indie game, but it looks promising. If you haven't already done so, watch one of the playthroughs on  youtube
