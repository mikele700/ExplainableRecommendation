Despite how the other reviews are saying it's a bad game, I really loved it.The graphic style was ever so unique that I was drawn to the game. I'm a person who doesn't usually cry at the end of games, but I got attached to these characters - I learnt so much about these characters and about their backstories that each outcome left me sad. This game really left an impact on me because this relates to my home life too, as a child I found myself like Tommy in multiple ways and the surrounding characters were too similar to be comfortable at times.The ending of the game was a bit abrupt in some ways but ever so touching, I actually got watery eyes in the end. I felt like I had made the right decision for the family, even though one of them was hurt in the end.Overall, I really liked this game, although since it left an imprint on me, I wouldn't be able to play it again. I highly recommend it to people who suffer from SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder), or low depression. 8.5/10 :)
This game - where to start?The storyline was amazing, it kept me hooked onto this game, and the ending was quite adequate.The music was simply terrific, I would honestly find myself listening to the music and dozing off quite a lot, it is definitely something that I could listen to a lot.And the design and graphics, unf, it was so good, they were textured so well, I would also find myself dazing in amazement at the artwork. It is simple beautiful - there are points in the game where you should just admire the scenery; even though it's not real, it's simply beautiful.HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!
Would highly recommend if you're into Detective-type games.Not as good as other games, but still good enough to keep you intruiged.Has 4 episodes, each of which comes out every month.9/10. Would highly recommend.
