must have if ur friends play it.if u have no friends then dont get it.
incredible game, dont listen to all the chumps complaining about DLC.
If you like games and/or have a large ♥♥♥♥♥ you must get this game
Amazing game.Perfect for anyone bored of minecraft, i got about 50hrs solo out of it, another 60hrs on a friends server, another 50 or so after 1.2 patch came out. Keeps getting better and better, the sort of game you can come back to every few months and have another 30-40hrs of a completely new experience.EDIT: 1.2.4 came out = another 50hrs
woooo, still epic game.Definitely better a few years ago but with a bunch of friends you can still have plenty of fun.A must have!
Do not recommend.Very short, unfulfilling, predictable story.Despite only paying $27 for it, I still felt robbed of a larger sum of money.Just play the original Bioshock against on a harder difficulty or something.
Freakin Crazy epic awesome adventurePerfect puzzle game you can keep coming back to!
Got called a noob poo face by someone from denmark10/10 would do again
