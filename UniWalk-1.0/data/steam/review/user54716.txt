BL2 wow what a game, funny as hell,  even more fun with firends!this game has a really greeat storyline an makes you want to play it more jsut make sure to bring a friend/sthe dlc where lacking in the fact there was no level cap increase for your character till the last few dlc but if you were to buy this as a game of the year edition it would be alot of fun!golden keys were dissapointing but the guns threw quests made up for that as they should even tho you would think using the keys at cap level would get you sum amazing artillery nope think again.There are amazingly hard boss's to defeat which require the right set of skills and a full group to go destroy them to collect special krystals which can be redeemed for awesome loot! (warning: this is no walk in the park scene)  overall i would recommend this to my friends an public. have always enjoyed the borderlands universe go check it out for yourself Twitch.tv/Count_Douch
huge zombies fan.this is the game that started the call of duty zombies!if you want to havea bit of fun with four friends then this is a must, the commuinty have modded the zombies and you will have to look for the mods online,but it will add tons more hours of gameplay to your skull blasting in this game!the mechanics are ok! (compared to the updated black ops 1/2 zombies) but this shows you why the game style became so popular dont pass this if your a COD Zombies Fan!Count_Douch
