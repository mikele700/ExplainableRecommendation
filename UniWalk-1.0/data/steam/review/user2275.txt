Well how do i start im a big fan of dayz and not much so a minecraft fan but throughlly i enjoyed this game even with its minecraft  Graphics even though its not as great as day z for a free paid game ait was quite good thae guns that shown to you is a good amount the maps are good but  i would of liked to be abit bigger. the first 24  hors of this game wre fun i enjoyed a system were i could upgrade my abillities it gave me something to occupie myself. the base bulding was bit tedious but i had fun desighning my base without being killed and base bullding mechanics were simallar to rusts which i liked scince i play rust alot. For a free game i would rate this: +++ out of five plusses
