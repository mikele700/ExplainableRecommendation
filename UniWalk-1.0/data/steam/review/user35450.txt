Oddly enough, the tab says -recommend to friends.-I can-'t think of a single person on my friends list who has not played TF2 before.I-'ve played TF2 for around 3500 hours now since I first started, and I still play it every couple of days when I get the time. This is my go-to game. Valve has taken every oppurtunity to improve on the gameplay and/or the quality of this game. It is, to this day, my favorate game, as it is for millions of gamers out there.Of course, you all know this already...and if you haven-'t played this game yet, what-'s stopping you?Trust me, it-'ll be worth the 10 gigabytes of download.
I love this game, I do.Great graphics, immersive story, challenging missions and high adaptability to your playstyle make this a great game.But why am I no longer motivated to play it?Well, honestly this game is great, but has nothing that really pulls it out of the other great games out there and honestly, I-'d rather be playing Farcry 2 or Fallout 3 then this game. It-'s a good game, just not one of the best. Doesn-'t mean you won-'t enjoy it, I definetly love playing in the every few weeks I load this game up for a spin. It won-'t get old and I haven-'t even played 10 hours on it yet...but that-'s probably one of the reasons this game isn-'t on my -to play- list.You may enjoy it, you may not. This is just my opinion. Either way, the outstanding features other games have are...well...kinda lacking here.
I'm sure everyone's heard of this game by now. I've watched a few playthroughs of it on youtube and had the plot revealed to me a long time before I finally purchased the game. Knowing the plot did not ruin my experiance of the game at all, because once you're at the seat controlling what happens, it's a whole new story.I wouldn't pass up this game for the world, I recommend it to all who are on the fence about buying it, and I recommend getting this masterpiece before season 2 comes out, because you're going to want to play through it many times to make sure you get every little piece that this game has to offer.
