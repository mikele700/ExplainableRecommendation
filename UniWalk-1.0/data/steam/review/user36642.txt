Secret Poncho's is a weird mix of top-down twin stick shooter and fighting game. And the combination works surprisingly well.
Full of character and humour. TF2 is the sort of game you don't uninstall even if you barely play it simply because its so awesome. Expect tons of hours of fun. It's f2p done right, with most items you get coming from drops. If your after a specific weapon, just trade for it. And if you hate all the thingamjigs they added on to it, just go to a vanilla server and enjoy yourself, you old geezer!
