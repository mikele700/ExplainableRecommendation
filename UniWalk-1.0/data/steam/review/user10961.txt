Don't take my on steam time play time as my experience with this game. I've been playing this game for years and have easily racked up 100+ Hours on it. This is a fantastic game with one of the best skill-tree desgined leveling systems I have ever seen!The story is nothing new, you're a hero of Greece off to save the world from various Gods and Demons, your usual Greek Mythos RPG but that's not the strong part of this game! This game's strong points come from, as I've already mentioned, it's skill trees - they're simply top notch.The game has no focus on PvP and with that they could focus on making some spells fantastical and simply, if the game was to have PvP, overpowered but because there is no PvP it's all fine and dandy. And even though your powers are mighty, that doesn't mean this game is easy! There are certain sections that can easily kick your ♥♥♥, especially on the higher difficulties.ALTHOUGH not all is well. If you plan on purchasing this stellar game for it's Co-Op I have sad news for you - Gamespy has recently closed it's servers for this game and it no longer supports INTERNET play (I have yet to test it's LAN functionality) and Himachi seems unable to fix this so far! So take heed if you plan on playing with friends over the net, at this moment (to my knowledge) there is no way to do so. However this game still is great as a single player experience. If you're a lover of games like Diablo this is certainly a game for you and definitely worth even it's non-sale $15 price tag.
