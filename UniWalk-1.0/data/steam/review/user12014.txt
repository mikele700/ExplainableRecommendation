It's a LOT of fun.A lot of Gamemodes (Capture The Flag,Capture the Point,Arena,etc).And it's free so what is there to hate?It doesn't even matter if you don't have all the weapons. ALL weapons have (kind of) equal attributes.Weapons that have Positive Atts will have Negatives as well.So come on down to Team Fortress 2 and have fun~
Threw a grenade near a friend.He died. Didn't count as me killed him. 10/10
I have to say.I find this game quite entertaining to playThis game can be extremely long for you if-You are the stealthy type of guy that would like to try and assassinate every zombie without making noises-You like to scavenge every house (there are a lot)I haven't even finished the game but damn it's hella fun (for me at least)Though this game isn't the type where when you die,you respawn.You search for supplies AND survivors.I got 2 characters killed.BOTH were favourite characters.I felt like wanting to pull my hair off at that very moment.So a friendly tip: Don't ♥♥♥♥ing die.Nevertheless. A great game. 8.5/10!
One average game..but not recommended for someone who expects -more-...pretty much in MultiPlayer,ALL you do is go up to the opponent/melee him until down/shoot him to death.To me this game is kind of -broken-.If you still want to download this game,go right ahead,nobody-'s stopping you.
