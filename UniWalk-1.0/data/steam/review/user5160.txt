The best game I have ever played. There is nothing like the competitive team play in this game, being the last one alive with your entire team depending on you is crazy intense. If you like pressure and playing a competitive game that you constantly get better at over effort and practice then this is the game for you. The eSports scene is also a blast with competitive eSport matches being hosted around the clock along with Major tournaments and Operations that comes with updates to the game to add the icing on the cake. The Aim, Nades, Smokes, Flashes, Recoil, Control, Knowledge, Stratergy, Skins the list goes on and on. There's even a thriving economy just for this game that you can even make money from! A must buy and is THE BEST FPS EVER. Let my hours speak for themselves.- Worth every single cent in your wallet and a thousand times more.
If you have ever wanted a game like Super Smash Bros but on PC then this is for you. Free to Play rotation of characters every week, Ranked matches (2v2's 1v1's) Custom matches (8 Players) play around with your friends in intense battles and a store to buy things like skins, taunts and characters.- A great action packed game that leaves you left with no words after you clutch wombo combo someone at the last second and get that promotion
This game had true potential... But because of the developers I can't really say that anymore, for now at least.- I cannot recommend this game in its current state
