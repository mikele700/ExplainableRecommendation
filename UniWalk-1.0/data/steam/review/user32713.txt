This is probably by far the best game i ever played, it has all of the good elements of a survival game and unlike other games it has completely randomly generated weapons, and enemies! This keeps the interest going for much longer then you would expect, and with it's multiplayer feature it is realy fun and enjoyable to pla with friends. This game get's a 15 out of 10! and i strongly recomend this game to anyone at all that want's a good experience that will stay with them for a very long time! (moding the game could ruin the experience of your playthrough. I know this because a very good friend of mine warned me about his mistake of adding item spawning mods into the game.)
Get it... NOW!!!
This game seeems very open but when you get tobuild your castle and you fly (drag) to the edge of the map it looks like a giant card board background. i would like the clouds to move not for it to look like that or at least make the wall largerand have a limit to where you can drag your view. Otherwise great game! ;)
