Garry's mod is a great game for screwing around and just doing pretty much anything
Brilliant game, the atmosphere is chilling and the art is wonderful. The first time I played this game, I was truly blown away by how gorgeous the enviroments were accompanied by an abundance of detail. The storyline is amazing, and the end left me speechless; a beautiful tale of love (as well as showing that love can be felt and received by anyone). If you have the time, pick up Gone Home, and indulge yourself entirely in this wonderful game.The Controls are smooth and everything works the way you want it to, the house is well-designed and there are endless crevices to be explored, a particular example is a TV room, when you first enter it, you'll get hit with a overwhelming sense of nostalgia, pillow forts and the blue-ish light that the TV casts across the room will leaving you smiling. The lighting in this game can create some gorgeous sights, and the lack thereof can send chills down your spine, granted the game isn't a horror, and I don't know whether it was intended or simply my own paranoia, but there are some cases where you may get a little scared, I'm not going to post any spoilers; but let's just say the house has plenty of backstory.Gameplay 9/10 (Controls are smooth, game works as you want it too; occasionaly getting stuck in doors)Level Design 9/10 (Beautiful area, the house gains more complexity as the game continues, but stays gorgeous)Soundtrack 8/10 (Throwback songs, not to mention the chillingly haunting tunes whenever a note from Sam is played)
