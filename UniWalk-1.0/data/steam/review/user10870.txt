great game only problem is the community sucks and everyone just KOS's you which ruins the game why cant we all just get along instead of killing each other
YAY microtransactions that what we all wanted♥♥♥♥ you Overkill
was fun until valve ♥♥♥♥ed up the ranking system
It is in my opinion the best game ever made and the best part about it is no more annoying calls from Roman to go bowling
doesn't even work when I open the game there is just a blank screen, I googled it and tried everything but it still didn't work. Anyone have any advice on what i should try.
I love this game its the most fun I've have had in a while
awesome best game on steam
