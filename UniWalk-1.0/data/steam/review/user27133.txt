DO NOT BUY UNTIL IT IS FULLY RELEASED!!!! Unless you want to rage every time you log off the one day with full gear you spent hours on finding in NW airfield which took you an hour to get to and then log back on as a fresh spawn on the coast near Berezino for no absolute reason then dont buy it and go buy the Mod. And until you can play this game its gonna be a loooooooooong time till they can actually fully fix a game borowed off a mod. And i mean 1-2 years... This game becomes a disapoitment when it comes to the alpha version.
so fun to play with friends
