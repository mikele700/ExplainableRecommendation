So I play ARK on and off with my friends because itâ€™s just fun to join servers and scurry to make a settlement or base and bicker about who own what dinosaurs. Then I get told by one of more hardcore ARK friends that they added payed DLC. This shows me that the developers still care for this game and its players, and they wanted to enhance their player experience with new ones. I feel sorry for the games development team for having to deal with all these entitled precious little children that believe that they are owed free content just for playing for an extended amount of time. Keep up the good work ARK devs. Until you reach DayZ levels of lazy then you have done nothing wrong by me.
