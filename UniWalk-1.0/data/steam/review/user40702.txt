I... Cannot... Stop... Playing!Rule the world, make it fear your military. Or perhaps diplomatically spread your dynasty to the many courts of Europe and slowly integreate it all under your power. Or ignore your neighbours all together and sail West to the New World, where all that stands in your path of infinite money are viceroys and natives. This game has a steep learning curve but once overcome, you will continue to find little things here and there to refine game after game and if you get bored of playing a certain style, there are plenty more to try.Oh and if you do play this game, be a MAN and play in IRONMAN mode. Save scummer!
The price and length of a movie but you can interact with it. Voice acting is supurb which is good as its basically the only interaction worth talking about. Aside from the story it looks pretty and the controls are simple.Loved it. Interested to play through it again in 6 months and change the script up.
