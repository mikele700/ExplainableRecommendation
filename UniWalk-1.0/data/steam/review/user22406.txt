If you want the genocide run and the pacifist run endings, get the genocide one first...I made that mistake and almost cried when I killed the bosses.
I spent $10 on DLC for a still image of a girl in a clicker...I'm not ashamed.
Amazing game! I've played it for three days just trying to unlock all of the playable factions but one of my favourite things is probably destroying the Aztecs as Scotland.
