Many hours/days/months/years on this game.Very pay to win ....what was I thinking.. 
Capitialism Ho! This game was all about profit.. Snappin necks and Cashing Cheques.. with some dungeon looting along the way!
I had alot of fun playing through this, I'm so ready for the rest of the episodes to come out!
I don't think it's possible to ever grow tired of this game!
Yer she goes alright!
