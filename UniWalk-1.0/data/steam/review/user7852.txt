what can i say about this game that hasn't already been said.Slick visuals, a great choice of cars and roads to race them on.A good single player experience as the multiplayer is completely dead.8/10
still one of my all time favourite games, eeasy to learn, impossible to master
should be purchased by everyonegood for lans especially
