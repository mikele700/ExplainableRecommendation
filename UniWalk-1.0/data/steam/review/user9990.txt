I really enjoy this game it is lots of fun. It is full of silly weapons like a fish and a frying pan. There are so many gamemodes and the game is being updated constantly
Besiege is a great game. Even though this is still in alpha it is fun. I really enjoy just making random machines and watching them fail and burn to the ground. I can't wait for more levels. One thing that this game is missing is a workshop.
