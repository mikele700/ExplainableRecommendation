With my low amount of play time your probably thinking -what the hell is he thinking- well your probably right. The game has a great concept, build,survive,kill. And with the multiplayer feature is seems like a winner, well...If you have a low quality computer/laptop then you may struggle to have a good time, on the other hand if you have a good computer then your sure to have a pretty high FPS and have nice graphics to!Also you can expect some bugs/glitches but yu get that with early access games and you can just ignore it.I would reccommend this game although if you have a low quality computer mabye go elsewhere GREAT GAME!
