Back at train hq, who ever made this is a genius, its perfect best $20 i spent in 2 years Has everything from vibrations to long routes, awesome , just awesome.Dont even think if you should get this, just get it  :D
It is worth having 100%, and for those that are wondering about it, even though it says - Season Pass - you own all the content forever, it just the dumb name they chose for it.  55% off, def worth getting, and for more proof see this :   http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?p=35969504
Nothing else is as realistic as this simulator, but it lacks more DLCs
Valve has made a slimy move on tf2, as the ideas start to fade they just COPY and PASTE CS : GO into tf2.  If we WANTED weapon skins...   we would play CS : GO  not TF2.  TF2 used to be an awesome game but now its just a remake of CS : GO, a copy and paste for more profit.  R . I . P     Team Fortress 2.
