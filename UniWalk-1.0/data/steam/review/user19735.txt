Quite disappointed that it isn't the next gen version of 2k14. Feel cheated after watching those new and awesome features in ps4 & xbox1 and I bought this at half price during steam sales. Steam should at least stated this in the description. Not much difference from 2k13. But still it is the best sport game I ever played.
