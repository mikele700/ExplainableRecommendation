I can comfortably say this is the best game I will play all year and it's only march. Absolutely amazing gameplay and graphics. There is such a level of depth and emotion to the game which only makes you want to play more and more. 10/10
Buy it, experience it, love it.

 Buy this game whatever the price tag as by the end you will understand why it's worth it, but prepare yourself to go on a serious journey.  Pros:    Simple, straight forward controls that anyone can use.  A story/narative that will leave you wondering who you really are.  Almost 2 solid hours of gameplay if you rush through and easily playable a second time. Cons:    Will make you cry and challenge if you really are okay.  You will be broke from now on paying for therapy to help yourself move on.  Davey (Buy, play and you'll understand).I would happily vote for this game to be game of the year. It challenged and affected me in a way I wasn't expecting it to. Don't read this unless you've played, really, don't. ~  I hope you and Coda find peace Davey.
