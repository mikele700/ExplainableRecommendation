The game itself is average, it's just the people that play it are pure aidsThey've now decided to add skillbased match-making so i can no longer find a single match.
Loads of fun. Very re-playable. Must have
i can't wait for the rest!
It combines my 2 favourite things, music & video games, into one piece of epic.
Had high expectations for this game (multiplayer) after Bo2, extremely dissapointed. Unbalanced, lots of bullsh*t, so on and so forth. For anyone wanting a good multiplayer game i either reccomend CS:GO or BF4.
Pretty dull, this is in the first few hours played because i have no idea whether the rest of this game is good, as it doesnt even work. Then i hopped on after the update to see my save gone. It's a terraria rip off (different developer), and a ♥♥♥♥ one at that
