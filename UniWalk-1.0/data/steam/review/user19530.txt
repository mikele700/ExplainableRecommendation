Some people say this is a cheap knock off of Minecraft, but it really offers a lot more variety when it comes to gameplay. With a plethora of items that have many different modifiers, Terraria stays interesting long after beating the WOF. The reason why I keep coming back to Terraria, like most sandbox games, is because there is so much to shape and customize to fit how you play. I bought this game whilst on sale and it has given me hours of gameplay and is well worth buying it at full price.
