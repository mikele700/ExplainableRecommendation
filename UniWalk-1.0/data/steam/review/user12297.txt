This game was very IntenseIt-'s Dark and Emotional plot has more than once had my Blood Boiling from certain aspects, Deeply Sympathetic from others.This was my first Visual Novel and never usually Pick something like this as a first pick, However my fears that i had starting it up, were quickly replaced with a desire to explore more of the Visual novel.The plot itself left me Pondering if such an event could of been Salvaged further than it has been so. The Political aspects were very Intense in how they were carried out. The thought of this being a valid possibilty has struck me more than once during my run through it. Yet i enjoyed the Story itself, despite what has happened.Regarding the two Characters you see throughout the story, they are too Life-like to be regarded as just AI (One having more reason to be more so than another). From the Refined and Pleasent Persona of *Hyun-ae, To the Feisty but yet Proud *Mute, these two -AI- are two girls that are able to relate to a wide Audience for many different reasons.I could talk alot more about this game, from the Intense Curveball that is thrown at you, to being forced to pick between two sides.All in all, This VN Deserves more Attention than it gets in my Opinion.Would i recommend it?Y.E.SFinal Score 9.8/10
I can think of Once sentance that describes this games combat in a very compact nutshell: BLADESTORM CARNAGE!!Seriously This is a Badass game of badass....You play as Raiden, a Cyborg Ninja that hunts Terrorists as part of his Daily Life.Raiden Himself from the beginning looks to be a very calm and a natural fighter.However Raiden begins to change his views slowly as he fights the Antagonists of the game.This shows that Raiden isn-'t as complete a character as he Initially lets on.The Gameplay gives a whole new meaning on the term -Carving one-'s own path- in a Litteral formFrom the alternate weapon styles, to the use of button press Sequences to add to the Intensity.The Boss Battles all have an Unique quirk to them, adding to the flavour that the game presents.The Audio itself holds a moral understanding of the current Situation during a boss battle.From the Audio of the Jetstream sam boss fights, to the Chaotic nature of Collective ConciousnessThe music grips you into the current boss with a bang.Ultimately Regarding my Final thought on this gameA wise man once said-Freedom and Order are both Polar oppisites that define our conflicts, yet both Compliment each other in the most Unusual way-Final Score 9/10Go forth Raiden and Carve your mark upon the world!!
If I have to put this game into 1 sentenceMedieval Castle Destruction Simulation for Strategy Extremists.if put into one wordAWESOME!!!!
