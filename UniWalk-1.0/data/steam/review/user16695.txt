TF2 is a great game. And being free, what more can we ask :DThere is a great variety of items (hats, weapons, miscs, etc) that you can customise and show to your friends, family, and everyone else in the world who are also playing at the same time.The Steam market deeply helps fellow TF2 players to sell their items at a reasonable price, in order to get other games, and/or items.There are many different choices of maps, and servers alike. I personally enjoy the ctf_turbine maps :)
Amazing graphics, story andThough, it's slighty lacking in hardness, as I basically started on tough, and finished it in a mere matter of days (okay, more like 2 weeks).I bought the soundtrack, and I love it.BEST PLAYED WITH A GAME CONTROLLER #PS2_CONTROLLER
