this game is great. i see every one complain and ♥♥♥♥♥ about the shop system and how its a some what pay to win game.in my belief this game is far from pay to win. the assult class can get the zx84k for only 4000 credits which if u dont spend any from the start you will ern them instantly. this gun is cheap, and it doesnt expire. the reason as to why somany people complain is that they are lazy because they wont spemd the time and effort to know the game i play really well with the zx84k and i dont complain. and TBH its less of a pay to win game than games like Tom clancey ghist reacon phantoms because when you buy a gun for real money in warface you only get it for 7-14 days but with phantoms you get it perma so shut up, get good, and stop being so negative.
