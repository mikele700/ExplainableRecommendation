Dungeonland is a ♥♥♥♥ing weird ♥♥♥ game. SO IT'S FUN! :D
When I lose to terrorists: ♥♥♥♥ing muslims.When I lose to counter terrorists: ♥♥♥♥ing Americans.10/10 not even racist.
An amazing game to soothe yourself to. The puzzle element makes this game really fun. But it isn't as fun as other games with friends, I suggest playing this game if you find yourself with no friends online a lot.
Best virgin simulator out there in the market on PC. Should be called -How to Train Your Russian- instead of Dota 2.
