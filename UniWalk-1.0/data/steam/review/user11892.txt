This is a very addictive game worth a try.The campain isnt that good though it is to shortBut the faction missions a very fun and there is a lot of them to i have finshed the game but still play it for the free roaming and explosions and police chases.Five good things about the game.5.Explosions4.Killing 3.police chases planes helecopters etc2.The faction/side missions1. free roamingFive bad things about the game.5.The campain is to short4.You cant snipe helecopter pilots to make them go down3.The graphics (ratting for me 6.5/10)2.That you have to respawn at the closest base and not where you died1.how if you sometimes just drive slowly past the cops you get a heatI STILL THINK THE GAME IS AWESOME!!!
I know i haven't played much of it. But of course as soon as i buy it, it's going to be free... These devs are know for stealing assets. (this will probably get removed) meh
