Garrys Mod has to be one of the best games on steam at under $10. It is very playable and really good to mess about with friends. This is one of the games that has also gotten me a lot of friends just from playing. If anyone has questions about it, just ask some of the people that love this game so dearly. I think that Garry has made a good game here. All the gamemodes are just so much fun to play, whether you are more into rolepaying or being a terrorist or murderer. All the games you want in the one, what more could you ask for?
i think GTA 4 has to be one of the best games of all time. The modding community is vast and the mods amazing. it is still an amazing game wether u play the story or not. I have never seen a better game for modding.
