Contrary to what people are saying, what you're wearing DOES change on your screen, for starters as Xian when you're looking down with the default costume, you can see her high heels, when you jump like this, you see her torn dress, with the survivor outfit it's changed to boots, shorts, and there's also a knife strapped to her leg, not sure about upper body though and no clue what any of the other characters look like but yeah. Honestly, for $2 it's not that bad, I mean come on, they're cool outfits and if you're playing with friends they get to see it too. Don't buy it if you're not that into things that only have a visual effect and no gameplay effect, but if you're fine with something that's just visual, get it.
This game is not just a Sandbox game as it has many gamemodes made by others etc, and because of this it promises hours of laughter, action & much more, and you will never get bored of it as there are so many of the afforementioned Gamemodes :3.
9/10 I loved this game, it was amazing from start to finish and the added depth from the -You look familiar- thing if you reset a save, especially Flowey-'s taunting you about the fact that he knows if you killed Toriel and then reset evoked so many more emotions, so far I have only achieved the True Pacifist and the Neutral Ending, and therefore, it would be impossible for me to attempt a Genocide run especially when I don-'t need to, and the reason why? Toby did an excellent job with immersion, I truly feel that resetting everything and erasing everyone-'s memories would be the wrong thing to do, and since I know everything still, killing everyone would be like if you had a puppy until it died, then random magic made you go back to when you first met the puppy, but instead you were forced to kill it, you know all the fun things that you were going to do and still feel those connections, but even though they don-'t, you can-'t bring yourself to do it, because you-'d rather go through all that time, even with the possibility of sad times, instead of stop it all from happening. Toby, thank you for making this, I almost cried many times, but my eyes wouldn-'t let me, I-'ll never forget the story you created through this game, 9/10 in the most realistic sense but 10/10 if that didn-'t mean that it was completely perfect.  If you want a game in the art style of Mother, fighting mechanics of Mother 3 and where your adoptive mother is a goat woman, this is the game for you. Or if you just wanna make a Tsundere Plane blush.
