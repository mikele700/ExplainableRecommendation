The next one should be in China and the main character voiced and modelled on Jacky Chan (I suppose this will mean he's ♥♥♥♥ing old but who cares)
Great game unless you dislike having to restart your PC to get out of the game.
I played it for free for a while and it is not worth $10.
Fun and puzzling and a kind of story related thing is starting to evolve, but it is definately lacking in story.
Terrible game. I tried to move the camera and it just went insane. Uncontrollable. A waste of your time.
This is the glitchiest game with the most errors of any game I have ever played in my entire life. Loved it.
This is one of the most emotional movies I have seen in my entire life. This has changed my life and I strongly recomend it.
Buggy piece of ♥♥♥♥. Money grab made easy to mod so people can still enjoy it. ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s...
