oh goddis gameis likewjf iouahfnlsdjhds fasuifkhsdjfoi sjfposifjsdf oisfsanoif ssjropiwe ufposijfsoaif jspriojwerp98 oifhsifhwpf98wn p98cj p9wjfwwhen im playingand very addictive :D(i could of typed more but i think my keyboard broke)
one of the most addictive game there isloads of featuresloads of enemiesA BILLION itemsit is like a Buffed binding of isaac modand the best thing about itIT IS FIRST PERSON SHOOTERit is a shame that there are no co-op optionbut still a great game, nicely developed by only two peoplegood job, Code Avarice and good luck with your later gamesP.S. the soundtrack needs more dubstep
lel like da gamebut plz it will be better if der was a story to y dey wer fighting on marsplz recommend a little lore to what is going onso dat i can play with a meaning :D(sorry for really bad language)
this game is something...The Story was beautiful, It kept me eager to play more with sudden plot twists.The graphics weren't too bad either considering a game which had came out in 2007.The Characters too had their own personalities which made me make connections with real life.It would be Awesome if the Developers could create a Re-vamped version, possibly a sequel, to be played on Next-Gen consoles rather than simply PC.
It was a great joy when playing  this game:blowing up medicsbackstabbing snipersheadshoting soildersjumping 360 degrees around a heavy as a scoutthe list is endlessAhhh the memeries ive hadIt will guarantee joy if playing by yourself or with a mate or twoI definately would recomend this game to people who are new to steamIt still has some problems with framerate and the annoying glitch or twobut who cares when your having the most fun playing this enjoyable game...(the game is good but plz limit the amount of twelvies playing this game. their squealing gave me an ear ache)
