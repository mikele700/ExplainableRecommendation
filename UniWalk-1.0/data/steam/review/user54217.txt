In Actual Sunlight you play as a man called Evans, Evans is depressed,he hates his job,his family,and himself.Warning do not play this game if your depressed. It won't help and will make you feel even worse. But this is a good game if you can handle it.It only goes for about a hour, but it deals with many themes like depression sucide self loathing and lonelyness.Should you get this game? If your not depressed I would highly recommend it. But this game is not for everyone. Though I still think everyone should expience it.
