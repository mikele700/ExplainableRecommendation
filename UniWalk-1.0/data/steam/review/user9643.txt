Dear ladies and gentlmanI have only played 2 episodes of  season 1 while have bought all of the season. I am about to start playing all way through season 1 however I wish to express that while this is the first time I am playing this type of game I do feel that I must write a review for this game as there are few games that I meaningly interact on the soul and heart level. I wish to express my greate gratitude for the developer in making such a stroy that even while I am male relates to me quite well. I wish there  was a same type of game specificly having male cahrecter I can rely to :D however I still like to play womens role to be able to understand opposite sex. That being said I wish to state my admirition for the game and the a storyline that was made for this game. I may not be a good critic but I must say based on two episodes there are little to few comentaries from the main charecter while I still love the storyline. bare in mind I am still reviewing this game based onm just 2 episodes. ON other hand I must state that the output of the episodes was little to smal that is why I am only now going to play the game all through th 5 episodes and I will write the following review after I have played all 5 pisodes from the start.Kind RegardsIgor Okhapkin
Greatest game ever made basis of all strategy games these days in HD I am loving in.
