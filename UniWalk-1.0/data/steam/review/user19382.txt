In this game, you will work hard to get food, water, weapons ect. All to have those things taken away from you whenever connection drops out, your character will be wiped and you will lose everything and have to start from ne again, so if you have internet that could possibly drop out even once every blue moon, DO NOT GET THIS GAME, it will infuriate you with its massive amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Unless of coarse you like having all of your progress wiped over and over and over again. I do know this is still in alpha but when your character is wiped that many times it gets a bit rediculous.
