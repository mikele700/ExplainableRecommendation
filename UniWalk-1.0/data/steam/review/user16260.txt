A good game, it's a very competetive game. I have to say something to people seeing my review.Pros :1. Very competetive2. Looks real3. Not run and gunCons : 1. Too harsh ban punishment2. Many ragers and noobs3. Guys who trolls alot4. People who just get killed alot
This game is the one to play,Nice gameplay.It is a very great game,So,everyone play this xD.
Well, I haven't played this game for a long time but I can tell you this game is not just an ordinary pixelated 2D- game, but its an awesome RPG game with alot of classes. The way it looks like a minigame. So if you die you lose all your stuff could be frustarating but fun in the other way. But hats crazy stuff, with effects. Awesome crafting system. And basically awesome pets. For my personal use, I always use the orc, because it is basically an attacking class. And lots of realms and bosses. So what are you waiting for purchase this game for a whole pixelated adventure.
