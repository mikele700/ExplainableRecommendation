This game is hard. It's a game you need dedication with and patience. It has truly stunning visuals and a great community. The game isn't just a pick up and go type, you have to really try and you will succeed! I remember getting my first few killstreaks and feeling like the champ, only to be slain from behind. It is an amazing game with more than enough servers, game modes, classes, weapons to keep you busy! Some times it can be a little buggy but others you have great matches with people (That I become close friends with!) and be busy chopping at them head!This game truly is an instant engravement into my heart.
