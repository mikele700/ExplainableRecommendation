What a ♥♥♥♥ed up game. So real. So much truth.
I like humor! XD5/5 for a $1 indie game :)
Great story. Very well made game. Worth a second play through. One of the best indie games you can ever play.
Cute. Smooth. Satisfying. Got me up whole night playing with them. There were up and downs in the end i feel very satisfied. Was a great release. Of tension i mean. No pun indended.8.5/10
If you enjoy these shooting games when u were young you will love this one. Loved the local co-op as well!
Beautiful. Stunning. 9/10.
Fast pace, great graphics, full of macho swear words and impulsive actions, emotions, friendships, revenge, quite enjoyable. 8/10.
It's a bit late to recommend such an old game but in all standards it's still on edge and impressed me a lot :)
Such an awesome game rich in every essential aspect a RPG game should be! Hundreds of hours play guaranteed. The Mods community is crazy too. Anything you want is modded :)
