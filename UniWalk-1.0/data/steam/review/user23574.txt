♥♥♥♥♥♥ Game. Not worth any price. Pirate it if you really have to play it...but its not worth it, no matter what the price. (Not even worth $1). Played better games that were free such as -How do you do it-. Story and Gameplay is average but gets SUPER repetitive (Like alot)
Totaly Recommend... Many Gamemodes so u never get board and an entire world of workshop content
GREAT GAME!!! Spooky in crypts and great overall gameplay. Buy it when its on sale though....
Great Game... 10/10 Get when on sale though....many endings :D
