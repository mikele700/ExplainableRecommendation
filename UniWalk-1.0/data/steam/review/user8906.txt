Game is fun but the Admins are as enjoyable as pouring lemon juice in your eyes after getting laser eye surgery.
GRIND THE VIDEO GAME!!!!!!P.S If you don't spend money you're ♥♥♥♥ed
I found a rainbow rodent and tried to commune with me. I then refunded the game and Bought Starpoint Gemini 2 with the money becuase it was on sale for $10, Starpoint Gemini 2 is a space trading and combat game, think Elite or EVE. You fly around a vast galaxy, smaller than in EVE or Elite though, doing missions, trading, mining, bounty hunting, etc. Captain your ship and level your captain in a RPG-like fashion. I turned to SG2 for that EVE Online fix. I would call it a simplistic EVE, but it's still very good to scratch that EVE itch. You can forget about the RPG system, it's so simplistic, but the rest is a full fledged space game. The game's looks take a little getting used to, coming from sharp and shiny EVE or Elite gfx, but after a while it grows on you and flying around the galaxy is as fun as usual.Getting through the story and all dlcs can take about 50 hrs, then there's some additional hrs if you want to replay SG story in SG2 engine, and then there is freeroam. Freeroam will not be so fun after completing everything as your ship will obliterate everything that the game throws at you, but still, 50-70hrs of game time looks quite amazing considering you can get this on sale.I liked:* quite a large map* lots of different ships* large amount of weapons and enhancements* flying in space shooting / trading / uncovering stuff!I disliked:* capturing ships is the only way to go if you want to make big bucksGet this:* if you're looking for EVE Offline and don't mind simpler experience* if you want to fly in space and pew pew stuffDon't get this:* if you're looking for complex space simReview by http://steamcommunity.com/id/rmzfm/P.S: Don't by Major/Minor unless you want to know what 12 guage tastes like.
