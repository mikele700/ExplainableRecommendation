Best game I have played in a long time, becuase it is so small (took me like 4 hours) the developers could make it as good as possible. Story was good and very unique and same goes with the gameplay and beautiful graphics. Very impressed with the grappling hook system and I always had the feeling of being lost yet somehow knowing exactly where to go. Overall, an extremely pleasant experience.
