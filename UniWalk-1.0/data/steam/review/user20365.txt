Ruined my social life. I now have no friends 10/10
Played this game back in 2004 when it came back on Xbox and absolutely loved it. Bought it again on PC to relieve those memories and the nostaglia is coming back! The game has aged quite well and is still my favourite game of all time. Highly recommend it
