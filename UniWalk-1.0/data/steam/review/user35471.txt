This game is absolutly amazing ! It's new so do expect a bug here and there but for what you get it is completely worth the $20 !! Heart-racing moments and utter relief at a seconds notice leaves you as a player sitting there completly overwhelmed at how much this game gets you thinking, the ammount of focus required and the communication required when playing with friends and even with randoms somehow having to help one another and communicate. I honestly cannot think of any flaws with this game what so ever obviously besides the bugs however that si to b expected of a brand new game. In my eyes this game deserves a solid 8.5/10 or even a 9. To my friend that bought this for me I thankyou for the amazing experience you have given me and for all the future heartstopping moments and laughs between our group.
