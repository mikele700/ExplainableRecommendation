Played when it used to be called Dragonica, was ok back then but now the game feel abit smother then it was back then, back then there was lots of lag and buggy which turn be off abit.
Love this game, my fav and 1st game I've played :3 I pretty much own it on every console that it's on xD recommand giving it a shot I guess if you enjoy other FF series and JRPG. There also a mini game called triple triad if you played final fantasy 14 you'll know it's pretty fun xDStory: 8.5 story pretty good it's base on war and loveBattle: 8.5 cause I like games that don't use mana xD pretty much it's all about drawing and that how to incress your stats or use the magic you draw :3Music: 6 pref the classic Playstation 1 ver over PCGraphic: 7.5 It's pretty alright just wish it was for everything not just characters and monsters
Good game played during Closed Beta [;
I'm not really scared of playing horror games but when I play this I was scared ♥♥♥♥. 10/10
Played since the Beta and I like how you can build your own defence to protect your base and not only that you can also use a hero you have and fight other people castle to level up and loot there castle.
Love the game so fun :3
