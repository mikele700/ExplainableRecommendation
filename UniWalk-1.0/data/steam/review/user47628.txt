This game is absolutely incredible and I cannot wait for the future updates. There is a lot more that the developers can do such as : Extra NPCs (bears, sharks etc.)  Make the caves dangerous and something you have to prepare for. (Almost like a raid maybe?) Add extra features to the clans (better identification and base building etc.)So far I have encountered a few people and the game makes it an interesting moment every time, you must find out if they are friendly and be prepared if they are not. Even without other people this game is intense and interesting, there are so many places to explore and so many things to do.I am really looking forward to the future updates of this game.(Check out my screenshots to see some of my ingame adventures.)
