Meh Ill give it a 10
This is an amazing game, I love playing it, it almost has no boundaries, apart from one Issue I have.Mods, I have a rather old graphics card, so I downloaded some mods to counter-act this, stuff that will lower graphics, get rid of grass etc. etc. But it wont let me join anybody, nobody at all, and with a person who would barely get 10-20 fps, suddenly getting solid 30 just to find out I cannot play online like this, was sort of a punch in the gut. Rockstar please fix this. I reccomend this game, (besides all the hackers and my issue with mods) 90%.
