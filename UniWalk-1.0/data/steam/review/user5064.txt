Great game! But there is a problem with the HO area 'Elegant Crank'. There is one piece missing so i'm unable to go any further in the game, i also used the HINT button to try to find it, but it's not there. PLEASE fix this. Thanks
This game is totally worth buying. So much fun getting together with friends to play it with. Workshop is full of so many items, you can make it look however you want it. I'll never get tired of this game, :)
Brutal, but so much fun. I recently just bought this game, and i can't wait to play more of it!!
I don't recommend this game. In my opinion, it's very boring. i played maybe around 15 minutes of it, not even that, and i ended up quitting the game.
