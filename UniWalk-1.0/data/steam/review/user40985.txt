Took my life. It took everythingHighly recommend. :)
Pros:Great game! Perfect for casual players or those seeking the competitive scene. A variety of game modes to keep you busy for hours on ends and although you have to buy skins with realmoney, theres so many that there something for everyone.Cons:Solo games can get frustrating.
