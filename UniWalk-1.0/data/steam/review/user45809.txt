This game is exhilerating. Before life is strange i had never really liked any story games, just stuck with cs:go and Team fortress 2. But this game is different. You really get wrapped up in the story, you start to act like and believe that you-'re max. I-'ve only played episode 1 so far and i-'m already addicted. You may think to yourself -but i hate games that require-'s puzzles and brain power!-. well, that doesn-'t matter. I am stinking terrible at puzzle games and i still found it enjoyable. So in conclusion, do I think you should get this game? Yes, For sure. Am i saying that you-'ll love it no matter what? No, i-'m just saying from the pov of someone that typically only like FPS-'s, This game was a pleasant surprise.Peace out, and if you get the game, have a good time playing it, i hope it was worth your money :) ;).
