This game is a first shooter game and it's a pretty awesome game, the unlocks of weapons are almost like infinite so you won't get bored just using the same weapons.Also there are a lock of things you can do here, rocket jump, sticky jump, airblast and more.And don't forget...Hats. They're very delightful and make your character looks way awesome,there are tons of hats in the game to try out and some have effects, but the most expensive ones are unusual, they look gorgeous and it takes luck to get it in a crate with a key.So if you want to kill people, shoot their heads off, just shoot their face,blow people gibs off and just have fun, you should play team fortress 2.I would personally rate this game 9/10
