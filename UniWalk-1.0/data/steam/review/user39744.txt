So I played the ghost campaign all the way till the end and I found the story line to be very appealing but the fact the the engine is the same as black ops2 and they didn't improver the graphics in any way is what i found most disappointing. The makers said they were going to stop hacking and moderate the game but i saw none o this and was disppointed once again at how many people found it more enjoyable to hack then play with the skill they had.
