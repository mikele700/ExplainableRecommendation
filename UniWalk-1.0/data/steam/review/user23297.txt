Even though everyone is saying they can't get a stable framerate I get locked 60 fps no problem.I have had no issues with crashing or anything. this is a game that delivered what it promised!pc specs:i7 4790k 4.0 ghz, gtx 960 4gb overclocked, 8 gb of ram
i had this game for my xbox one first and i thought it was an awesome game so now i am getting it for pc!!!!!
