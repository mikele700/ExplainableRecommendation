Yeah starbound... aah well... it was a fun game for 5 minutesI honestly don't see much of this game sure it has a sweet trailer but over all it was a bit dry.I've played alot of survival games and the means minecraft... I'm sorry I'm a discraise D;but this is the stuff that really lacked for me:-No choice in ship custimization yeah sure you can put a fue paintings or whatevers in there but you get the picture from the start you know no choice in your ships begining look. >:|-And honestly the story lacked ALOT!I really would'nt play this game until its almost completely all bug fixed and some work added. dislike 4/10
Aaah... don't you just love to sit back and enjoy a quality dungeon crawler? Well this game has everything from a gut renching intro, a never ending lust for battle! And to top it off the feeling of loneliness... This game is your bucket of depression... In a good way though. I rate his game 11/10. WARNING: Mac users should avoid this game due to unbearable lag!
GREAT!!!
this is amazing! surgeon simulator 2013 is the best simulator I have ever played and its the only simulator I have played but apart from that, I would recommend this game to all ages sure theres some blood but I guess thats surgery for you...
This game makes me feel something I haven-'t felt in years. The doom classics bring back my memories as a young child, I used to play Bugdom and that somehow brought back the exact same feeling. 10/10 -I-'m not joking!-
Unturned is a game that is available on steam... That's it.Not the best game on the planet.
