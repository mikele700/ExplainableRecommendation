I freakin' love this. Great pictures, great storylines(yes, storylines), great soundtrack, and many choices that await just around the corner. It's one of those games where choices REALLY matter and you have to make sure to pick the right ones. Although, there's no way of telling whether the choices you made were good or bad until the ending. Another thing: this game likes to stick to your mind. Like, really stick. You'll go to bed later on wondering what you could've done better and weeping with a broken heart because you got seperated from a character in the game which you felt something for, or you could have a smile on your face because you're with someone you really like and got the good end with them. Honestly, this game has made me feel things i've never felt before - e.g: Inspiration, saudade, love, depression... It's really touching. This game has taught me a few things, and I abide by them to this day. It's changed my perspective on things, how I act, what to do in situations, and I even managed to gain myself a girlfriend :DI highly recommend this to anyone and everyone. Trust me, it's worth your time ;)-1 point for making me cry xDSeriously, amazing work Soviet Games!
