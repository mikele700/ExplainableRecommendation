Doesn't hold your hand and looks amazing! Favorite indie title. 9.5/10
Great game. Those looking to kill some time will find this does the job.
Loving the new Menu Sim 2015. Especially love how i don't even get all of it in one download. It's just adding to the hype! Can't wait to see if this game ends up being uninstall sim if i don't get the whole game soon! :)
