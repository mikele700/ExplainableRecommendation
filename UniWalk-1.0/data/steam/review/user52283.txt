Holy ♥♥♥♥, this is a god game
its pretty cool
when DayZ meets minecraft, makes it a pretty addictive game to play alone or with friends.
oh wow, This game is one of the best games i have played. The story line is very interesting and the map is very big and heaps to explore in your own time when you can. Most of the time playing a mission i would get carried away from all the things that you can do in side of Harran. I have not played many hours of this game but i can tell i'll be very hooked on this game for a while which i cant wait! Thumbs up for this game, try and get your hands on this game if you have the money, im sure you wont regret it! 9/10!
Yeah this is a good as game annoying but highly addictive go get this game good as game favourite game i have and the best game out. but could be a few things fixed 8.5/10 IGN
