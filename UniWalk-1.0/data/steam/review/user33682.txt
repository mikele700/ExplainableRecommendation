I have never seen it fit to write a review about any game that I have disliked. However, dont waste your time with this sh*t. Poorly optimized, horrid hit registry and pathetic guns and classes. This game encourages team work but doesnt have the basic gameplay fundamentals to support a range of approaches. Your time will be spent walking through fields, looking at low textured walls and hillsides untill someone you cant see, either its due to poor render distance and resolution or theyre just straight up the master of disguise, pushes your brain out of your skull. When this game does go well it is at best a lot of shooting at areas where you think enemies might be, until you are killed and forced to spawn across the map and run all the way back because your squad leader forgot to put down a spawn beacon. Just do yourself a favour, if you want big open spaces and to pretend to be a 'real soldier', play arma. If you want devastating gunplay with walls and surfaces with actual textures, play Insurgency. This is a hybrid of the two that just simply is unnecessary. Feels like ive been here and done it all before, except with a game that actually worked. Overall it is not a 'bad' game but f&ck it hurts to play.
