THE GOOD Fast-paced gameplay puts a fun and challenging spin on RPG mechanics Full of amusing parodies and references to famous RPG scenes and tropes Excellent soundtrack Lots of hidden secrets to sniff out Multiplayer is tremendously fun (If you get to play it) The story is very amusing, if your willing to read it allTHE BAD Lacks the gameplay variety of the original Gets way too wordy at times, slowing the pace8.5/10
More people should buy this game because it's amazing.
