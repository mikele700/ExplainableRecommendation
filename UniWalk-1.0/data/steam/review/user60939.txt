great poker experience i reccomend for ages 12+ enjoyable characters enjoyable climaxs and theres a bonus if you play tf2(Team fortress 2) like me
this game gets a 11/10 for its perfect gaming experience replay value and overall enjoyability I reccomend it for children of all ages
you can play as chuck norris and shrek 10/10 add in dankey
id have to give tf2 a 10/10 much much improved to its older brother tfc enjoyable characters gameplay and much much much replay value no wonder ive racked up 600hrs of it
not the best mmo out there great art style not the most balanced i reccomend playing as a warrior or general attack class such as mechanic or demon slayer over all its a interesting experience emulated by no other game
