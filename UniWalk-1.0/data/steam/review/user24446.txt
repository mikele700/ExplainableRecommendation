This is a great game for younger gamers, its basically a minecraft + DayZ mixed game but more of dayz but less bugs than dayZ, its quite hard to believe that a 16 year old named Nelson Sexton made this game all by himself and so far I-'ve got over 100 hrs in game and I-'m loving it, its got simple graphics but it makes up for it because it gives you a chance to feel a -I-'ve got to survive this- feeling and thats what I love about these games although there aren-'t many Aussie servers that are 24-7 Online its still got great potenicial and I think Nelson could potencially make the game even greater than what it already is and if he chooses to let the community do the features when 3.0 comes out with the workshop + modding api maybe it-'d get more purchases for Gold but I think if you buy gold its not just about the features but actually that your supporting the development and pushing the game along so it can be what the community wants.The Survival featuresyou can basically run around a town and find a melee weapon anywhere but when you find a gun, you know you-'ve got to save the ammo and don-'t be a complete idiot and shoot in a town full of zombies and make them chase after you and when you run out of ammo you-'ve got to quickly equip a melee weapon and thats fun as I-'ve died like over a million times by doing that and the experience/skills are great but I guess their could be more unqiue skills? but when I got all the skills I was partying with chemlights until a zombie came and killed me because I put my weapons in my chest... and that was the end of my skills well not exactly the end of them they give you back half of your skills but when you-'ve got like 3 levels of one skill once you die you-'ll get 1 level in that skill back over all the Survival features are awesome!!The Crafting FeaturesThe Crafting is a little hard to get used to so you may have to google the recipes up like I did a thousand times and the great thing about it is that you can refill your bullets so if you found a gun in a town then it-'d be a civillian gun so you can use civillian bullets to refill it but I was confused when I had a swift mag because when I click on it, the desc says its a Military grade mag but I can-'t use military bullets to refill it thats because you need Civil bullets because its found in civillian areas aswell as military, but when you create a house you can bascially start putting some skills in crafting and outdoors if you have Crafting level one you can craft a Crate that doesn-'t lock so anyone can open it and steal stuff but also with level 1 crafting you can make some stone crafting recipes when you have level 2 crafting aka Max crafting you can craft either a chest which is locked and has 6 slots and the metal locker that has the same 4 slots but I guess is harder to break with a sledge hammer and other melee weapons, also with crafting level 2 you can make metal building materials which the person who placed it is the only one who can open or close it. you can also craft other stuff out of cloth and gear like attachments and etc but overall it would be really good if the person who placed the building material could actually pick it up if they placed it in the wrong spot or just simply want to move.I love this game and I would seriously recommend Buying a permenant Gold upgrade although I haven-'t done it yet I-'m going to so i can support Nelson and I rate it 12/10 :D best of luck to Nelson Sexton to making 3.0 possible!!!
