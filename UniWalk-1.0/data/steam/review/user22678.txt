Hmmm, it was a pretty interesting read, but as a person who has played quite a few VN's over the years, I can't really call it one of those, it's too linear. I'd call it more an interactive story book. Still lots of nostalgia on sound effects and what was popular back in the day. All those little touches made a difference. Not a lot of replay value, but I definitely don't regret playing it, and I'd recommend it to others. 8/10 for for a fun hour or so (while I tried to get different endings).P.S. On an interesting note, I tried to get with Emma just to see if something different would happen. I kept checking her profile each year for clues. Then I got doubly sad when I realized Emma was into the exact same music as Emily, and you were probably substituting her for the one you really wanted........ouch.
Having a blast playing, cautiously optimistic for future content. Mods make it look better, go get those. Have fun exploring.
