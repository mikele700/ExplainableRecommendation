Totally AWESOME I love how you can craft your own bots  but I only wish you could sell your bots on the community market and arts
the games brocken i could not even get in but if i could i think it would be good
I like the game mostly I just you could change the view you see and there was offline i'am not saying I don't like fully online but some people want challenge of the game
Yeah it's a fun game I love the graphics love the weapons i love most things about this i just wish it had a better storyline
