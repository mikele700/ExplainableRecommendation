A mix between: Twin peaks, Gone Home, and The Walking Dead (the game). In a sense this game is heavily story driven which is explored through the use of cutscenes. The cutscenes are however affected by your decisions. Your decisions follow the traditional interactive game :you point and click and your decisions affect outcomes in the game ( to some extent) However, what-'s unique about this game is that it gives the player the choice of rewinding time to re-choose between your options with the knowledge of the outcome of the previously chosen decision.+beautiful visuals+fitting sountrack which complements visuals+unique idea+something newHowever, this game as aforementioned is very story driven. There won-'t be a lot of -hardcore action- It-'s also initially set in a high school environment, which may turns some players off. Side note: Parts of the game involves mingling with the school environment as well as the drama associated within it (female interaction & drama). TLDR: play it for the story. story is told through cutscenes. story is affected by your choices. can re-visit choices.
