The only game I have ever played that has caused me to feel tiredyou know that thing that happens when you read and you start thinking about something but keep reading subconciously even though you don't actually take in the words, that happened to me playing this game, and i still won the racegreat game if you need help falling asleep or need something mindless to do whilst listening to music 10/10
