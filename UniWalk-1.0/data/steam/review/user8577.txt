The game is great I would rate 6/10. Until all the bugs are ironed out. I do lag a lot though. I wish this game had a few less bugs and was less intense on my PC. I do still love the game and it still shows hope. If you are going to buy this game remember to be an active member of the community as updates and bugs (TONNES AND TONNES OF BUGS) need to be reported to the devs. Still a good game!!I woke up, ate breakfast, got ready and then left to run around with savage zombies who don't know how to climb stairs, open doors or turn on laptops. Then I got home from school and did it again
