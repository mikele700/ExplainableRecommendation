BUCKLE YOUR PANTS!
THIS GAME IS AWESOME! But the slack of the developers, updates aren't getting much feedback for the game. Its been about 7 months or so (dont get me wrong) since we last had an offical update.  (Recent one was just technical changes... i think..?)Vanilla gets boring without updates, so thats why i play with mods, but those mods arent like new bosses, and EPIC changes, its just one of those new guns, techs and maybe several customized items kinda thing.I do enjoy playing this game, but they really need to make big changes for the community and the game itself.
i cant stop playing
Garry's mod is a really fun game.. but how can i play when i keep crashing? When im joining a server, it closes gmod, when i spawn ragdolls and props, it sometimes crashes, i cant change my character anymore, some addons dont load, AND THE WORST PART IS CRASHING WHEN YOU DONT SAVE.. WHY CANT U FIX THIS GARRY, WHY?!
