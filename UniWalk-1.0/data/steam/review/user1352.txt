Not the worst game. Lots of hackers but the gameplay is fun and good graphics! PAY 2 WIN, not been updated for years and crappy customer service. Do not reccommend
Yeah a pretty decent game if you have a decent computer. Can get boring in a couple of hours if you play it on end. I do recommend this game.
Amazing Game. Great if you love FPS' and that kinda stuff! Highly Reccomend! Get it while its on sale!
