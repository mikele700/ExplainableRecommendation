If you can get through the high price, very long download (>65gb including updates that the launcher downloads), and hassle of setting up an account, you are rewarded with a quite amazing game.If you're expecting a multiplayer Skyrim like game, don't, because that's not what this game is. While it is similar to Skyrim in some aspects, a lot of the mechanics have changed, graphical styles are different, and there are many features in place to optimise the game for MMO gameplay.Warning: this game is highly addictive. If you start playing for a bit, don't be surprised if all of a sudden 2 hours have passed.
Too many Russians.1/10
haven't played much but looks fun
At the moment, this game is little more than a simple Half-Life 2 mod. However, the game is growing rapidy, and after playing it for a little while, you might grow to like it.If you enjoy TF2, CS:GO, or other Source based games, you are probably going to like this game. Basically, you work together in a team of up to 5 players to either plant a bomb and escape, all the while fighting zombies (Bomb Escape), or hold out for as many waves as possible (Survival).Give it a try, it's free and not a massive download.
If you get lucky and can manage to get on the servers then it is a very good game, but most of the time with me it is like this:LS: Queue position: 1000+. Estimated wait: more than 30 minutes.Great game, ♥♥♥♥ servers.
Threw a can at a guard. Guard got angry.11/10
