This game is awsome. Runs smooth. Fun as hell.  Go solo or team up still the best of its genre and wait.....its only in alpha.development team works close with players was surprised to see them lurking around our sever.cant wait to see what eles they can do to this game. 9.9/10 - Give me some pointless rank to grind and ill be happy no benfits just somthing to say im better then c**ts
