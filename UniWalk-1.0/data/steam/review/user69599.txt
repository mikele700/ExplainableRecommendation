If someone was to ask me whether i enjoyed this game, i would probably so no, this is because there are enough micro-transactions here to put Apple out of business... The graphics are dated, which i hope they fix in a later update and there is literally no character customization apart from what hair and clothes you want.I think that with work and effort, this game could be really good.
