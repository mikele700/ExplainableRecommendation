brill plane simulator where you can do some sick stunts like a 360, cartwheel, flips and my personal fav -how do i start the plane-
i only have on song on my computer, -Hero- by Nickleback, and i play it over and over again for hours on end
A vivid and engaging portrayal of mankind's eternal struggle against the evil that is Mother Nature.

At the beginning of the game, keep at least one warrior on your city, while you research Bronze Working. Once you've got that, build an archer, and fortify him on your city. Use your previously fortifying warrior to look for bronze. Once you find it, build a settler and make a city on/near the bronze. There, enjoy your swordsmen. That should make things easier for you.
this is the most epic of epics and these trains are unironically my heroes
