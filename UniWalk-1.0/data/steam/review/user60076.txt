One of the best FPS out there and competes with games such as TF2 and COD. Besides the occasionally unfriendly players, it is a fun game and diffently worth the money
This is a very fun game of you like adventure games. I'd discribe it as a mix of mine craft with a platformer game. Over all very fun and endless game play
