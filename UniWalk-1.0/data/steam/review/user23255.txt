If you like unrewarding tedious gameplay, with the 'skill' being hyper aggressive enemiy hordes, near permanent 50% maximum health then this is the souls game for youUnlike the previous installments there is no warning, thought or imagination put into the ambushes, traps or repurcussions, and you will be punished iwth death for simply progressing through the game!No more worrying about your build because youll need every point in damage and adaptability to even survive, oh and we also buffed smelter demon(s), and broke their weapon hitboxes so have fun with that.>♥♥♥♥ing play DS1, DS2, DeS or BB this is trash and we're lucky its a standalone game not a new patch on DS2.
