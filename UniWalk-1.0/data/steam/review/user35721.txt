Darkest Dungeon ZERIORA Review *OK 3/10 people found this helpful. Truth hurts doesn't it?Yes, this is VERY hard at the latest december patch. I just started the game and I've been thrown the torment difficulty instantly. The game itself though, is perfectly designed. The battles are fun and challenging, The dungeon exploration acts like your exploring a real life dungeon in 2D.FIRST of all, this game is NOT for you if you want the game to hold your hand through it.SECOND of all, This game is still early access, it is not complete, WHICH MEANS, major changes are approved.THIRD of all, this game has turn-based battles. Attacks can only be dodged by chance, so this means, without dodging an attack, or resisting an effect, you WILL take full damage.Note: You AND Monsters can resist effects and dodge attacks.SummaryThis game will give you the middle finger if you don't man up and think about what your doing. Do the wrong attack or force stress on your heroes. Your ♥♥♥♥ed.If you want to become a hero and fight the evil without hesitation. Your a man, and this game is for you.If you want the game to hold your hand and help you fight the evil. Your a child, and this game is not for you.Recommended because it's a great game, it has great potential.
A minecraft type game, except more features and 2D. You guys should really get it, it's so fun when you get the chance to dig with people and find as much loot as you can.
