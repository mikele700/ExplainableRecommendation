Space Engineers is an amazing space exploration game (now planetary exploration), as i played the beta i was suprised by its amazing unique features that other games have not seemed to scratch the surface of, most of these voxel open sandbox games get boring after a set of hours but with space enginners the set of hours has not been reached yet, although its fun building and driving machines, the grind to build may be tedious for players with low tolerance.I loved space engineers at first with the amazing concept and gameplay although now im lead to dissapointment as it cannot run at the same settings it was, as i use to get an eazy 60fps on 900p but now. i stuggle to get above 10fps will minimal settings @ 720p which has angered me and unable to play the game at all in some instances where the game would instantly crash. although the game is amazing and the concept is smart. Space Engineers has deteriated in performance for not just my rig but others with high end rigs stuggling to hit 30fps in 1080p (medium settings). its a shame to see such an amazing game become unplayable and not fun to open to play with friends as you will always end up crashing the server due to bugs or unable to controll you character due to frame rate <10.i loved this game in beta and i wish i was able to recomend this (which i could if it was the same game it was last year) but at its current build with its current features and issues i cannot as the updates break the game further and further. (at least for me)
I have no idea what you are all complaining about, this was one of the first games that got me into gaming, it has exadurated physics which make it fun, and it is my optinion of one of the first games with soft body physics, so everyone stop complaioning and play it, i have played at least everyday of yr1-4 in my schooling days of this game, so to sum this up- its fun- its fast- its excitingi could not think of anything bad to think of this game, your all so mad about the graphics but you should understand that the game is very old!
NOW THE GAME IS ENJOYABLE, and i now will definatly play the game alot more than i used too
AMAZING CONCEPT vs REPEDITIVENESSQuick Review :DPROS-Classic FPS Style (No Cover +High speed)-Graphics (DX11)-Physx (Destructable Enviroment)-Challenging (lots of difficulty choices)CONS- BUGGY- UNCOMMUN CRASHES with multiplayer- VERY BORING- VERY RepeditiveIn Depth Analasis -.-This game will need a beefy pc to run a solid 60Fps in medium-high settings  I love this game and the comeback of thge old classic fpss like quake and doom, i hope more developers make games like this people need to look at this game and give it a go it now has workshop support so you can engoy the mod community and the classic fps feel of the gamealthough there are many proes the cons make the game a massive decision maker, the game is a -grind- of shooting and picking up ammunition, the games structure and level design is ok but i beleive there are other games with better level stururing and item placment. this game is VERY REPEDITIVE and can get boaring in under an hour or somtimes 10 minuets.The game also has lots and lots of complex graphic settings and computer language that a common gamer will not know, all of these setting took me lots of time to configure and research to find optimal perfromance for my configuration, the games default optimal setting is not relyable but is good for a user that does not want to spend 30+minuets in the menus.
very good very much like diablo but very good for beginners like me lol
