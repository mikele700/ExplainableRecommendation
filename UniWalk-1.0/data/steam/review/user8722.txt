Great game, alot of mixed things in the game such Batman Style moves and a little bit of assassins creed in there too.Can get abit difficult if you fail quite abit, there is no difficulty setting from my understanding..
The game is all bugged, Frames have issues with alot of computers and it still has not been fixed, definetly not reccommended to buy.
If your after a game looking like Sims City but... well.. Better, than this game is the one for yah!
absolutley amazing, 10/10
