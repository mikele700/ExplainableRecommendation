i enjoyed this game for a time, i liked it-'s roleplaying elements, i had fun playing as a -check out chick- of sorts i played like i was in the job in real life untill i failed a few times and then i started deporting everyone i was indebted a few thousand dollars to my home land, my family is both sick, cold, and hungry. beyond this there wasn-'t a fail state so then i wanted to let only women in the country and the first woman i let into country with this plan i had in mind blew herself up in the name of kolechia this was the fail state as i was imprisoned and put to a firing squad, overall  7.8/10 too much paper work
its good combo of dayz meets minecraft
