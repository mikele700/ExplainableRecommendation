this game is freaking awesome. while shooting you can spill guts blood and even have a hole from your chest to ur stomach. besides that its like the future from borderlands 1 or 2.
good
bit glitchy and it has a few bugs which makes the screen turn black, but other than that i got so scared at 8:30 in the morning. I love it
