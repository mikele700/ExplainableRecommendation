What can I say? I sold my house for my skins.
This is legit what happened when I played Civ one day.and oh yeah, Persia is overpowered...9:00AM -Friend says: Let's play a quick game of Civ V while we wait for friends to come on steam.16 hours later...1:00AM -Oh look, we missed like 8 invites and it's early in the morning, wanna play another quick game? I promise it'll only take an hour or 2.12 hours later...1:00PM -♥♥♥♥ I forgot to eat breakfast, I'll be back soon15 minutes later...1:15 -zzzzzz*face in bowl of cereal*
