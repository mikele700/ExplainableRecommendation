an amazing game, totally worth owning.
I love this game.its exactly what ive been looking for in a town builder, the ablilty to create my own buildings and themes, it reminds me of a 3D gnomoria, and i loved that game aswell, sure it has a few bugs, but that comes with an early access game, in short, if you like god games, then this is for you.
