Great game 10/10 Game of 2015Probably my favourite gameReally got me hooked!
Crowbar  collective did an awsome remake of half life.if u cant play on the old outdated graphics of half life BUY THIS GAME!the graphics are nice btwthis game is great besisdes some issues i had, maybe because I refunded and bought it again.and one more issue the last chapter lambda core was extremely glitched out for example when u killed an enemy it would fly everywhere or just simply just sink into the ground.Any way 7/10 for a great remake!p.s does not have xen level
