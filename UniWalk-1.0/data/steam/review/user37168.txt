SHORT VERSION | The game is pretty great.-----------------------------------------------------------------------LONG   VERSION | Pros:+ Characters are quirky, almost too much so, but I love each and every one of them.+ Game is challenging enough on preferred dificulty; with good balance between complexity and simplicity.+ The Humour is sometimes cringey, but for the most part its good for a giggle or two.+ The art style is consistent, it may not be for you but it does maintain aesthetic consistency.Cons:- Quite grindy at later stages.- Hearing the same song for the same enemy can get repetive very quickly when doing said grinding.- UI is console driven, and can be clunky at times for PC and keyboard.- Limited options if you're not ok with that sort of thing.The experience has been overall positive with this game, if you're not terribly into rythmn games or RPGs then one of the two genres might drag you through this game with some minor gripes, but for the most part even if you're not terribly into either it is worth it for the characters and the story.7/10
