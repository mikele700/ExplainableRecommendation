Terri Irwin would have had an easier time pulling a bindi out of her ♥♥♥♥ than running this game with losing connection in a solo game -_- 0.00002/10 Would not buy Jug Again
BattleBlock Theater is a fun fast paced game with lots of team work involved. the story, characters and narrator are funny as hell. If you are looking to relax and play a game to just chill, then i recomend this.9/10
i like this game :P
For MKX Mobile, if I want Cyber Jacqui and Undercover Cassie I need to buy an Xbox 1 Or PS4, not to mention how dead online is. -16/420
