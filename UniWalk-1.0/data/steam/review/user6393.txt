This is possibly the best RTS I've played.  If you like the genre this is a worthy use of money.
Insane.  Any critisim that I could write is drowned out by the screams of that guy that I tied to a fighter jet.Not the deepest story, and more than a little bit racist, but certainly a crazy game and incredibly fun.  Go cause some Chaos!
