Its a cool game very fun team game. The only down side is that it is hard to learn e.g there are so many heroes, items etc to learn and techiques making dota 2 a hard game to learn. You have to be a hard-core gamer to play dota 2. better than lol
Squishy piggy is the most dankest game i have ever played. In this game you play as a pig which attempts to suicide to make a deal with the devil to revive his parents.Best story plot eva. Very emotional. Much touching. Too MLG.Rate 9/11 would play again
