This game is the reason they will have to come up with a new name for early access in a couple years so we, the consumer, will stuipidly continue to pay for games in advance. ...so at least it has that going for it.
This game apparently has a charm that is lost on me.I didn't like the art styleI appreciated the combat/challenge aspect but i found it quickly became repetative.The story telling seemed good but the writers sense of humor wasnt for me.Unfortunatly after about an hour or so of play i didnt want to play any moreWell priced though
Its not bad.Story is what kept me playing.  The game play got old after about an hour of the same same.Got 5 or 6 hours out of the game though.I would say its worth $10  Its a shame that Sandy didn't make an appearance though. 6.5/10
This game is awesome!  But now i have RSI.  sadface
