Game was fun for a  while. Add some planets and get a thumbs up!Love the planetary exploration and scenery
Great Survival Multiplayer game! tons of things to do.
Cant even complete a mission because an AI or Player ship is always there to stop me from getting back to the mission carrier. 8/10 Very nice concept and the ship battles are intense
Got it while on sale so Im happy. Basically the game is about flying in any country you'd like a bit stupid how you have to pay for a better scenery though but other than that good game.
Hilarious game I love how stupid the ai is XD
Game with no limits, Tons of mods and fun to play
Great survival game about trying to survive from cannibals and mutants after crashing on a mysterious Island. After a while though the game does get a bit boring for me after finding everything but the updates always make me wanna play this one
Awsome concept and space survival. In my opinion the game is a little complex but it does have brilliant features like Open world planetary exploration, Flying from one planet to another without a loading screen popping up and many other unique features
Normally I would hardly play a lego based game but this one is a bit different as it is a sandbox lego game where the limit is your imagination.
