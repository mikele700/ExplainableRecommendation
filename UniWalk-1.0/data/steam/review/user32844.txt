I f*cking hate how you have to turn up the volume super loud to hear the breathing so much!! (In a good way!) My poor heart, why do I do this to you?9/10 Best game in the FNAF series.
My Experience With Amensia : The Dark DescentIt-'s a fair game, plenty of scares. Not the cheap kind like jumpscares, actual terror.Once you figure out how to avoid monsters easily it-'s not as scary.All in all it-'s one of the best horror games I-'ve seen.Make sure to play in the dark with a good set of headphones, for the best experience.Final Score9/10-OH P ISSING BLIMEY THERE-'S JAM COMING OUT OF THE WALLS-ufeff- - Ben -Yahtzee- Croshaw
Good game to play through for the first time, but horrid to replay with ALL OF THE UN ♥♥♥♥ING SKIPPABLE CUTSCENES!Ahem. Still enjoyed it though.
