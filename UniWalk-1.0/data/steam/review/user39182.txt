Team Fortress 2 (aka TF2) is one of my all time favourites and was the game that brought me into the steam comunity over 5 years ago now. bought it before it was free and was definately worth it <3 fantastic game no matter what class or what map your on. with all the mods and varrying game modes, its never a dull game for me
