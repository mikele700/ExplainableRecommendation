Worth the money, although there are some game threatening bugs... I think that it was worth the money, its such a fantastic game that all my friends are buying it also. Finding your friends is a little tuff, thinking they should setup a friend connection thing so you can spawn near your friends. That would be so cool!
So, I have enjoyed the game so far except for some bad bugs which pretty much made me ♥♥♥♥ out of my face. Randomly being killed by nothing is fine compared to spending hours building that damn log building and when finally finishing it doesn't actually build. I collected everything but I can still walk through it, can still see the white outline and I can see a spot where a missing log is mean't to be on the roof, but won't let me place it. 82 logs... 82 FREAKING LOGS IT TOOK!Other then that, I will recommend it for the most part. It is interesting, scary and all out amazing with its gameplay and graphics. The AI is brilliant and also its shaders just makes me cry in happiness. AMAZING GAME. GET IT.Plus they said COOP may be coming so yeah... ignore any bugs really as it is in alpha, and just play and help the devs perfect it. PLUS COOP AS I SAID BEFORE... HOLY ♥♥♥♥, I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO MAKE SOMETHING MULTIPLAYER AS I HAVE HAD AN EXPERIENCE WITH THAT BUT I DON'T CARE HOW LONG IT TAKES YOU GUYS... DO IT. YOU HAVE THE MONEY NOW, COMMUNITY AND SUPPORT. 8/10 (would be 10, but some bugs really ruin experience)
