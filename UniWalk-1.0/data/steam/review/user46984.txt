Your main objective is -don-'t starve- which is difficult beause there are monsters, pigmen, spiders and other cruel beasts hunting you down.Story wise: There isn-'t much of a story in this game. All you have to do is survive. You can find worm holes throught the world and that tells you a bit of story but not a lot.6.5/10Graphics: 1 word: Magnificent. Don-'t Starve-'s graphics are best played on high. They look great with charecter animations, enemy animations or Wilsons-' surroundings. Plus all the animations are hand drawn which looks great! 9.5/10Sound: It-'s fantstic from cutting down trees to slaying spiders or pigmen. Every footstep sounds different whenever Wilson steps foot different terrians. 9.5/10Overall: Don-'t Starve is a great game overall. It-'s just the story need to have some work done on it. 9/10 (Must Buy)
