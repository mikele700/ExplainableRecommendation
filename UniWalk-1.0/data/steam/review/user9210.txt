what can I say about this game the story had me from the start the music ahhh I could listen to it all day long and the hand drawn art it's a master peace on its own.At first I was sceptical of this game my English teacher recommended this game to me as related text for the my HSC, and wow as I'm writing this the  ending has still left me in shock, still trying to process the effect this game has had on me.  Just wow. this game is unlike any other game that I have played and I strongly recommend getting this game.Some of the puzzles had e scratching my head and sadly I did have to go online for a little bit of help.
brings me back to the days  of my childhood highly recomand great story and still good mechanics that work well
great game tho i wish things where explained more through the game with out having to go to outside resources for help. but over all 8/10 keep up the good work :) Since the game has been released i find myself comming back new features are being implemented monthly the community is pretty decent and the mods for the game just keep adding to the game. its a great little game well worth the price and also deffinetly a must have if u can pick it up on sale
i love this game yet hate it at the same time, when playing with friends it is awesome but often playing solo means having a bad day highly recomend
great game very easy to get lost in for hours
