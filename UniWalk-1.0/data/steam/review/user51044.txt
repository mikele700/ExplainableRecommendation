I've ♥♥♥♥ing had it with this game, I swear to god, if you don't die from flying off ladders while trying to climb down them, you randomly break your leg while standing still, and if that doesn't kill you, you will more then likely get mauled to death by zombies who either won't die, or continue to chase you through buidlings like they are nothing, and for the unfortunate ones, the zombies characters don't even load, so you have no idea where to hit to kill them.I know it's a Early Access Alpha, but come on, if you are gonna charge 30$ for it, at least fix the giant ♥♥♥♥ing holes in your game before even releasing it.For one minor example; I was recently waiting for the servers to come back online after they were taken down for a update, all good and well, servers come back up, I log on, time to head out and find more gear. Well no, I can't because for absolutely no logical reason, my leg breaks.Being the stubborn idiot I am, I decide to endlessly barrel-roll down the stairs, out the building and around the corner to some trees, I make a splint out of the wood I get from chopping the tree, seemingly getting better until I hear a zombie. {Panic face on} I sit there, crouched with my trusty axe in my hand ready to kill the incoming zombie! Waiting.......still waiting....., after a good 4 mins of sitting there looking in every direction around me, I decide the zombie isn't going to come after helpless me after all, especially when I can't see it anywhere. I start applying the splint and boom, there is the zombie, now making a nice meal out of my intestines simply because I could hear the zombie 5 minutes before I could see it.However, In my current anger, I would still recommend this game to anyone who wants so many bugs and glitches that you end up putting your fist straight through your monitor and into the pornography collection you have hidden behind it.*DayZ Crawl-alone Edition* Because at any given moment, your leg will break, making you crawl for 5 hours until you find the items needed to fix the ♥♥♥♥ing bone sticking out of your shin.
