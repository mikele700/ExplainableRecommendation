I would recommend this game as it is a very good game not only for the history nut like me but for those that just want to dominate the world with armys of redcoats, frenchies, austrians, prussians or tsarist russians. This game is mostly historicially correct with a few of the uniforms and other aspects being wrong. All in all a great game.
