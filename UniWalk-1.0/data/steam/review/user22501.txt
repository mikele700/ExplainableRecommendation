Lone Survivor is a great game about survival.It was much more than I expected it to be, because I assumed that it would be a run through the apocalypse, kill zombies, and escape the city kind of game game.But it turned out to be a deep psychological adventure, where every choice you make affects your mental health and ultimately your fate.Your mental health will affect what some people will give you, while mental health also affects some of the things you'll see, and how the Lone Survivor will behave in certain situations.The game play is nice, it allows you to have much freedom in what you can do.You can sneak past the enemies, which is good for mental health, or you can simply shoot down anything in your way, which is bad for your mental health.This is one of my favorite games, and I would reccomend the gameplay, graphics (if you like pxels anyway) and the story because each is enjoyable and differs with the choices you make. =)
