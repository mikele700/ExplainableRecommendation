I rather play ESO
Um what even is this game? I got locked into a shack and could not get out... Apart from that it looked interesting but I deleted it.
I dont like it... I rather play SWTOR, or ESO
Use to play this game on PSP, it looks so different and I didn't enjoy it that much compared to on a console. Also requires you to get Game Ranger or something alike it because multiplayer runs through GameSpy which is now closed.
WARNING: BEWARE THIS GAME IS EXTREMELEY ADDICTIVE.I have had many nights where I would start playing this at like 5pm and the next time I look at my clock it is 1pm on a worknight. What can I say? It is fun! A great concept and there is plenty to do. So if you do get this game I suggest putting a timer on, but who knows if you will stop playing then either.
