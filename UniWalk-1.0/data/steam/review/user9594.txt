And ive done it 64 times.I hope Secrets of the Magic Crystals gets ported to phones so I can play anywhere, anytime.I RECOMMEND BUYING THIS GAME
Unfortunately this game was not like people expect. I was hoping it to be about border patrol. It Wasnt. The Borderlands arent what you think. Very Cartoonish. Most people will not enjoy this.10/10
Great game, very addictive and now worth 3 dollars.
This game is quite fun, and can be very addicting. This was a little too futuristic for my liking, but if you are into lasers and plasma guns and stuff then buy this game.
Personally, I didnt really enjoy this game. I thought tey could have done better and I regret buying it. Yeah. Includes Multiplayer
I love this game! Would recommend 10/10 Its awesome now so I cant imagine what full game release will be like
