Spent half an hour running around a level trying to get items as a dude with robotic punching arms. When getting said items I got OHKO by an overloading magma worm. 20/10 will get electrified many many more times to come.
A noir story that Hitchcock would of been proud of, this little gem of a game is wonderfully written with plenty of guessing until the end. For myself I did predict some things about the plot, but I did not see the twist coming at all. 8/10
