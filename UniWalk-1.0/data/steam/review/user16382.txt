If you find some form of excitement about attacking a French Spy with his own arm while wearing a hat that's on fire, this is probably the game for you.But seriously, Team Fortress 2 is a unqiue, enjoyable FPS directed towards a wide audience. The game introduces a sense of silliness while also maintaining a healthy dose of competiveness in the game. After playing the game for three years, I have had a good experience with the community. There is a lot of creative items in the workshop that sometimes make it into the game and many forms online that had help players with any problems you encounter.The graphics are nice to look at and aren't too demanding on your system. The classes (characters) and maps have a nice cartoon-ish, yet detailed, design.The main cons I can think of is that you might have some preformance issues, depending on your system. There's also the daunting hitreg that can really screw up your shot, and the fact that there is a heavy reliance on other members on your team, which can make or break the round (though that can usually be fixed with good teamwork anyway).There's also the fact that your wallet will be empty sometimes. Depending on the update. (It's worth it, I swear. Eating is overrated anyway.)Anyway, I won't ramble on any longer. It's a good game and the pros outweigh the cons pretty easily. Plus I've spent over a thousand hours on this game, and I wouldn't mind doubling that amount in the years to come.
