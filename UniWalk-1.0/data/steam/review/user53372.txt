I love, love, LOVE this game. You can work on many things and never get bored, travel to many places and shoot a /lot/ of things. Some jobs are challenging, but we all need a good challenge here and there but you can keep working at it! This game is like a mix of World of Warcraft, Quake and CoD: Ghosts. I don't know, but I /really/ love this game! :)
