Ok...so this game has a lot of issues to work out...however,i will stick with it until it is playable. Then i will give you a proper review. So far of what i played i was not able to start the first quest due to white box issues,so i will wait until it is fixed.
......
I really dont know what i expected.....it sucks...plain and simple
Well,its not normal for me to write a reveiw without putting more hours into it first,but this game is nearly perfect for me....i love it.
