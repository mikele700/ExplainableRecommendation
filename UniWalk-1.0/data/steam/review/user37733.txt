When your teammates aren't getting all gun-ho and what not it's the most fun you can have without getting undressed,
Grand Strategy doesn't get much grander. I only wish I had more time to pour into this ball achingly amazing game.
Playing as the Guard is a true delight. The stuck up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who lead them is pure ear cocaine.I love everything about this game. Except the Blood Ravens. Clowns.
