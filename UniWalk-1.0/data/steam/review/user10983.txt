This is a really good JRPG not many on steam like it Con I have a 770 GT and 720p is a problem and 1080p is unplayable Historia Crux is a bit confusing if you do not pay attentionFinal Fantasy name is holding XII-2 back i get it it is not  Final Fantasy (  ) that does not make it a bad game ProsSerah and Noel are enjoyable protagonistsThe battle system is quick and easy to get used toTaming monsters is an interesting twist.The storyline introduces various, fun and simple dialogue exchanges which allow you to learn a lot about the characters past, what they want for the future.The soundtrack is incredibly beautiful.The environment is still as beautiful as ever.Moogles are adorable. I can't help but feel bad when I throw Mog Serah and Noel are bad parentsI can simply just enjoy the game, I can explore and redo things however I want. Making this one of my favorite games.
