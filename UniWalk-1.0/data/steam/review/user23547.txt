Best MLG peasant simulator on the market.10/10 It's pretty okay -IGN
Buy this game... Just Buy it it is amazing you will ♥♥♥♥ yourself luaghing! This game is so good it is eassily in my top 5 games
One of the only games on steam that is not even worth a single dollar.
Made a base Disconnected, When I re joined my concrete base was rock and I was downing under the map... 10/10 would drown again.
is good
My very good totally not sarcastic review of Ark: Survival Evolved.The game is great!First off the game runs amazingly, it-'s clearly very well optimised. [That is sarcasm for those of you too stupid to figure it out for yourself]The pacing is perfect, it-'s not a true survival game unless it takes a year to do anything.The Dinosaurs look great, everyone knows dinosaurs are part rock monster. It-'s very uniche and not just a survival game with dinosaurs thrown in to cash in on jurassic world.I also love how when you review other dinosaur games negetivly people say -Try Ark- it-'s very useful cause I had never tried it before someone told me to, not at all. Overall I give the game a 9/11 it-'s perfect no flaws at all, and if you think otherwise then screw you.
I used to love this game but since the last few updates it has become a mess... I would not recommend it in this state.
