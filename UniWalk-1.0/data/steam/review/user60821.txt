Looks like the original, runs well on a low end machine. As a game it's fairly repetitive in the sense of what there is to progress through the story. The lack of versatility in how to race through the levels is showing and a reflection of the time this was originally brought out, retro frustration will definitely settle in. Controls are by far the worst aspect, not a sympton of porting I would think but the original game's fault, any device you plug in will not optimise your experience, you most likely won't reach a satisfactory level of control over the pretentious nature by the end of the story mode if you stick with that but if you have the drive to go into practice mode and put in the hours go for it. If you can stomach that part then you'll enjoy this as a whole.Great soundtrack, nicely priced, making your own graffiti is nifty to have and an orgy of colour paints a ficitonalised version of Tokyo to play in.This game solely has my respect for it spawned its (FAR) superior successor in Jet Set Radio Future which would be a very welcome addition to the PC platform. Playing this game will only make you make you realise how sweet a JSRF port will be, almost impossible to fail if the port quality is the same.
