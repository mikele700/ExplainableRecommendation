So ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ it's good. ♥♥♥♥ because of hackers.  Good because its CS:GO.
if you want a world war I Squad based FPS, then this is the one. it may be in beta at the moment but honestly, i think i spent my money well, its great in both graphics and gameplay considering theres like only 3 people developing this game . i havent played much because i just got it but my first 2 games were sensational. get it, you wont regret it. :)
EXCELLENT, just great.
