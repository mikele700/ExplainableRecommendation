it was once so beautiful, but look at it now
Nice art style and plays well with the story so far has been well executed. The first update was out in three days and they have a well thought out KickStarter that gives me confidence that they will deliver on this titleand you can jump and do an action dive, I can't tell you how important it is to me to be able to mindlessly jump around while i'm walking in an RPG
you can eat humans, the low level humans make for easy pray and you can use there hide to make clothes   10/10 for Buffalo Bob simulator
i've just finished my first play through of Banished, now having started with the loveliest village called New Haven, i was off to a good start and about 10 minute's that' when the famine hit and i quickly realised that my village wasn't actully a peaceful town but infact a death camp.  With this New Haven became a living hell.One winter quickly wiped out all but one family of five the only saving grace is that the father was able to produce beef just in the nick of time to save his family comeing throght for them where his wife's failed peach orchard had falen short.  what followed for these brave survivor's was fifthteen years of adverse misery.  ocasionally they would starve but the next head of cattle would be slaughtered to feed them and this went on for years and they all survived.  There children even reached adulthood at the ripe old age of ten when they could work and become contributing members of society and help to rebuld New Haven to its former glory.Now this is where the story takes a turn for the worst,  six years in a hard winter hit that took the life of ther only daughter before she could even make one year of adulthood, she was taken from this world, the only upside to this is that i didn't have to watch her enter an incestuous marriage with one of her surviving brothers.it was a few more years before the family would have any good luck, this cam in the form of another daughter, they named her Leather becuase i guess they thought it would make her tough.  she died within a year of birth and thats where things got realy bad.  the cattle had a bad year but the peach orchard finaly came through for them just in time for winter to kill all the fruit, starvation quickly ended the fithteen year tourment that the four surviving family members had endured.
