I have over 1k hours in LFD2. The reality is, I want more. Buy this game and lose your life with me to.
I started as a depleted Byzantine. I managed to work some weak alliances and build a sizeable navy. The ottomans decided to not attack me straight away and instead build up their forces. I gift, suck and lick both Hungary and Poland to have them as additonal allies against the ottoman threat. We wed our daughters all is well, the day arrives that I send my diplomat to the respective super powers. I unpause, Ottomans declare, Poland and Hungary both say screw you. R.I.PPlay this game and you to shall be owned.
