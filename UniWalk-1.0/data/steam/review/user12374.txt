I do really recommend this game. TelTale did an excellent job working with the original cast on this one. With Christopher Lloyd coming back to voice doc and A.J. Locascio doing an amazing job for Marty you'll be thrown back in time. The icing on the cake is the Michael J Fox cameo in the last episode. If you loved the back to the future trillogy than you'll certainly love this game!
