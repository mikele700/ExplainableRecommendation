very graphic game i like it
great game good community not the best since alot of under 16's play but that's the same with every other game if you like mobas and RTS's you're most likely going to love this
the most realistic ww2 simulater love ithit/damage models are great
its like agario but better
Best F2P RTS ever no micro transactions so thats lit uhm build your own ships thats lit mmm campaign is challenging thats lit PVP is on fleek could have bigger matches but its still lit af fam
