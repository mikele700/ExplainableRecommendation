probably the best 1st person realistic shooter out there. doesnt get anuf attention becauz of cod and battlefield being fast pased unlike insurgency bein slow paced
great for anyone who wants to rob a bank with a friend, the absurd amount of dlc might put some people off but those guns are matched by the vanilla guns, for example the falcon (big bank dlc) could be compared to the m308. there are also a few free dlcs like the shadow raid hiest and the diamond store. OVERKILL's community integration is awesome cuz if you join the payday 2 group you get exclusive stuff; http://www.overkillsoftware.com/crimefest/ . in the hiests you can go loud or silent with different consiquences like if u go loud you might have to do an escape after the hiest (like cafe or park) but if you do stealth it isnt very interesting
1 of the best fps out there in the cartoon catagori. lots of fun as any class includin big mun (hevy), gay pyromaniac (pyro), sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (spy) and aussie camper (sniper). beware cod and bf snipers! you have to charge headshots! (dumasses think evry game is bad or like cod)
