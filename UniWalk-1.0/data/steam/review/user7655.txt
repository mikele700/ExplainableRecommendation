I threw hitler into a flaming pit and now The sound of chainsaws makes me weep uncontrollably 10/10
One of the most underrated shooters ever, awesome storyline makes you truly think about some of the horrors of war. Literally felt sick for about 1/4 of the game. Amazing ending and multiple choices well worth playing
Excellent game, great follow up with very little but good changes
