First of i have played all the Ghost Recon titles and they all have an amazing tactical experience and I like how ubisoft has gone in and taken all the best tatctical elements from the games, mainly from future solider and implemeted them into a free 2 play  multiplayer game its truly amazing . if you ask me i would say this game is all about skill and has no pay 2 win elements in it sure if you want too dump money into it and get some pretty fat gear its your choice but you can unlock everything by simply playing the game and earning the in game currency, you could also just stick to the first tier weapons as they are really cometitive and have los of mod options to improve. this game is amazingly balanced and has little too no bugs. All the classes are balanced evenly and are fun, Weapos just have that amazingly crisp feel and look.Just pick it up your not loseing anything because its free.9.5/10pros - inspires teamwork- easy to lear cover system- encourages tactical gameplay-plenty of custimisation options- amazing graphics and gameplay-addicting-free!- Amazing matchmaking systemCons- terrible ping - not alot of servers in countries like australia- Needs more maps and game modes- needs to be a bit more optimised as im running a gtx 780 and still not getting 60 fps on high
fun game get it and have heaps of fun with friends
