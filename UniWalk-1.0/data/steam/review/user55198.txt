World at war.. Probably the best Cod I have played since black ops 1. (yes I was a late starter into the cod franchise.) People still play this for not only the awesome multiplayer.. But for the custom zombies. The effort map makers put into their maps makes people want to go and get this.. Hell If it wasn't for them I wouldn't have touched this game. I HIGHLY recomend it! 10/10!! For people looking for custom maps to play I recomend Cheese Cube and Prission Mission by ZK, and also Chaos Island V2 (if you want a challenge!)
10/10 One of the best games ever made... Buy it now you won't regret it!
