Fun game, could play for hours, I have a pretty low end laptop and didn't expect it to run but it managed medium, so optimization is pretty good. Story time, got hungry couldn't find food, found a gun and a bear, proceeded to shoot bear in face with only bullet, got 35kg of bear meat.10/10 would terrorize wildlife for food again.
