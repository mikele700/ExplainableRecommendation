Basically the Hunger Games in a video game. I personally love the hunger games movies alot so I tried this game and overall it is a fun game to play solo, or with friends. 9/10http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=719789702http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=719554205Pros - The game play is fun and it takes no more than minutes for each match to start.        - You can craft different things such as traps and weapons        - It has its moments of funny humorCons - It has only one map to play on and that map is basically a forest with builldings-  There isnt a load of weapons- Character customization is very limited
This game is overall a good deal for the 10$ price.  It is basically a game where you control the air traffic for different airports around the world.  It is a good strategy game,  and almost makes you feel like you are at a real airport.  It is fun to play for the first 1 hour,   but after that I might play ita little bit before my day to warm up my brain for gaming.  If ur not sure about buying it,  definitely wait for a saleðŸ˜ƒ 6/10.       ~first five minutes,  thinks it is the start video    ~few seconds later a plane crashes and I deal with the sadness of virtual loss Make sure to check out my other reviews on my profile,  and please rate up + leave feedback!
This is by far one of the greatest fallout dlcs ever made. The map is larger than life, the entire nuka cola amuesment park feel is amazing, and every area of the park has fun surprises. Might I add, the theme song is addicting https://youtu.be/pnmbtXJGUr4?list=PLQ6MBTcTkCBDpSd29VicZlji-Cf1CLLj-http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=756716331http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=756716697http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=756716556http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=756716520Spoiler : are fav Nuka Cola lady from fallout 3 returns!
