How to describe Skyrim. Hmmmm...as you may see from my small number of hours on steam with this game, you may think that there will be better peoples reviews to read. I would have you know, Skyrim was a game I was so overwhelmingly excited for, on the day of release, I was able to pick up my pre-order from JB Hi-Fi...for PS3. Playing 5 characters, and a total of approximately 600 hours on playstation (with many unfortunate characters RIP of corrupt data). I have played very close to every mission in the base game. However due to Bethesda being Bethesda, and for some reason having something against playstation users, I was forced to apeal to Gaben and open my wallet to his relentless steam sales. In doing so I was able to get the game of the year edition for Skyrim for less than it would have cost to buy one of the DLCs for PS3.But you dont care about any of this, do you.Skyrim is a spectacular game. It is rich with lore, history, and an amazingly open and free world. Skyrim redefined what it is to be an RPG, and set a standard that no game has truly been able to match since. I have no faults to talk about in Skyrim, no bugs, no unfair or unbalanced parts of the game to mention. And now, with the Ultra DLC you can download for free, the game could not look any prettier. It is a beautiful masterpiece everyone should have the priveldge of playing.10/10
Hands down most addictive game online. I have lost countless days and nights to this game. Beware you can never truly quit TF2. Everyone has tried, but none have succeeded. Pretty good though. 1 recommendation, never get into trading. It will ruin your life. Its too late for me, but heed my warning, trading is a deep deep hole which you cannot escape from.
