I have played this game so so many times. And not ones have I gotten bored with it's immersive story, fun physics and intense fights. Also for any kids out there that think the boat section is boring there is a secret place near the end of it where you go in a pipe and see vortigaunts singing so there is that. http://www.wikihow.com/Find-the-Hidden-Singing-Vortigaunt-Cave-in-Half-Life-2. Game is gr8 i r8 8/8 while fingering my prosta8.
