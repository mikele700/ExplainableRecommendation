I have always been a fan of the management game genre but there are few that do it well. And then rimworld comes along and does everything amazingly even in early access. The core game is fantastic and with each update a tonne of content gets added. Modding this game is easy and very rewarding, from little things to new furniture or weapons or big things like whole new factions and races.Its still in early access, the updates are like 2-3 months apart and packed with goodies. I haven't had any bugs or issues that have prevented me from playing. Even when using mods the interface is great and easy to understand. 10/10 one of my favourite games of all time. I got it when it first came out like in 2013 and put in about 10 hrs a week minimum. Everything the game does it does it well, you can farm and train heaps of different types of animals. Also your colonists will develop opinions of each other and get into relationships.I am rambing but its all so good.
