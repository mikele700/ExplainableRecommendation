10/10 amazing game, NOT PAY TO WIN, those people only complaining because1/ they are bad2/ they just want jetsif you are playing just for the jets and high tier, don't play
This game is great, really, it is. But to play it you need at least 4-5 hours to get all the gear, travel to the right places, and kill some people along the way. This game is a must buy, because once the full release is out, expect the price to sky-rocket.
real gud
