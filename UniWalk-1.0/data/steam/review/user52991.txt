Very fun game, very good looking, and a great concept, combat can be abit daunting at first but once you catch on its very funpersonal my fave class is archer with short range bow standing in the thick of it defintely more fun with friendsgraphics-9gameplay-8audio-7community-5 (mainly because nobody speaks on the servers much)
