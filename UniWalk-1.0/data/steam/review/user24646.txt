Having invested a large amount of time into previous S2 titles (Savage 1, Sagage 2, HoN and Strife), I was super excited to see Savage 1 resurrected as it is one of greatest and unique games I have ever played.Savage Resurrection whilst still requiring work in regards to optimisation, UI design and game flow (S2 appear to be patching every couple of days) is a fantastic re-make and I cannot have asked for any more. This game is fantastic and delivers and is super cheap for $20!I am keen to see clan and replay functionality added to the game and I can only hope this game has a great and distant future.
