I loved this game at first. So fun and building your own creations was always fun. Then, when you go higher and higher through the tiers, you look at things differently. -I must build a better robot to kill the other robot!- you think to yourself. But then, you realise that there is only one good robot shape. The gunbed. Soon, the game loses the charm it once had in tiers 1-3. You no longer see a giant white ♥♥♥♥♥ or a ridiculously large tower. It gets worse. I spent $5 on this game. Then, I was so overpowered, I didn-'t feel like playing anymore. It-'s too easy once you buy premium. So, I do recommend this game, but it is only to be enjoyed for a short while. Soon, it will get boring.
Pixel artsy bullet hell top down shooter. One of the most frantic bullet hell shooters out there. Despite the large P2W themes, I believe that you can easily earn your way up, with a small amount of panicked grinding. Even the grinding is frantic, as once you die, YOU LOSE EVERYTHING.Both pleasure and pain, I highly reccomend this game.
An excellent zombie (infection) survival game. YOu can choose either to play it fast or play it slow, sneaking around with a cricket bat or blasting heads off with a grenade launcher. Even though I've spent less than 100 hours on this, it's still in my favourite top 4 games on Steam. If you are getting Steam, this is one game you must get.
