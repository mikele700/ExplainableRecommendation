A journey back in time to a nostalgic period in gaming, and within this period? An era of ultra-violence, drugs and promiscuous women in a setting worthy of silver screen glory. Hotline Miami is a game of courage, persistence and most of all a willingness to venture into a time where synth music and cocaine were todays dirty beats and chronic.Also you brutally murder countless Russian mobsters.
Truly an amazing game, to read my full journey into the game follow this link: http://forums.dayzgame.com/index.php?/topic/164309-first-thoughts-and-feelings-amazeballs/
Only my entire childhood summed up into a story narrated by Ray Liotta.
