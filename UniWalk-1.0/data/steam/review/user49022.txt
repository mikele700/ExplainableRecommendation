Deffinately reccomend path of exile to those who wish to sit down and go into an amazing rpg experience.The pool of skills and passive abilities is amazing and the quality of gear for most zones is great.It's a bit tough currency wise in the game because you use your currency on your items as well, full re roll of item abilities no worries, found a nice piece of armour and its only normal sweet use an orb of chance, oh sweet it's rare now.One thing i do like is that classes can be decieving, like for instance the witch, if you stat her elementally and give her some energy shield boosts along with minions boosts she can be a heavy battle changer, kill a few enemies, raise about 5 minions, and 7 skeletons, have the abillity that gives monsters a boost in defence against the element you hit them with first and a 50% decrease in defence from all other elements, there we go we have ourselves a very powerful witch, but then again i've come to realise that in Path of Exile even you when hit the level cap if you wish you can play that character forever and still find those extra skill points to get to those other passive abilities you just couldn't reach with roughly 1 skill points.but you cant just run your character build off what I think is best, you have to explore your options and be wise about how you get to them, every skill point counts, one mistake could mean that your character loses some usefullness in battle I also like the way that you have 2 weapon equip slots, toggling between claws and a dagger and sword combo makes battle so much easier.9/10Gameplay is brilliant all in all.P.S shop is mostly cosmetic items apart from pets and guild chest slots
