So this game has been in my library for a while (I have been playing it alot) and it has grown a special place in my heartbut with it going free to play I personaly think there has been alot of -jerks- on this game.What happens is Alot of people hate them and most always say that -Y U PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU DONT KNOW HOW TO!-i mean YOU know this always happen.I myself teach this dudes to be better with the mechanics of dota, not be a jerk to them.When you are new to dota you always get bad comments on you, One of this is -Quit Dota please- or -Uninstall-i have not covered my whole review but i will, soon , I dont have much time :(
