Absolutley glorious action, it starts off a little slower so you can learn the ropes then ramps up the action completley and you-'re fighting for your life counting the seconds until the drop-ship arrives.- -Get to the choppa- is said a lot.- The levelling and progression keeps you entertained.- Drop-in, drop-out co-op is implemented very well, someone joins the game and immediatley drops into a ♥♥♥♥ fight.- The global map, everyone is contributing to a common cause is a great idea.- The bullets spewing out, the airdrops raining down and the mechs stomping around make just about every encounter intense with lots of pretty lights.IGN 10/10 would recommend again!
Great game for anyone who wants a realistic WW2 strategy.
