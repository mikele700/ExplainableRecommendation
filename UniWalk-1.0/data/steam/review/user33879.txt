Amazing game! More of these modern combat games need to show how war can affect a persons mental state like this game does. It's a fairly short campaign, but the story was the great, the length the game didn't bother me at all. Well worth playing a second time just to absorb more the story. Just keep clear of the tacked on multiplayer, it's garbage.
Without a doubt the best racer of it's kind available for the PC. To call it a “Mario Kart Clone” is not really fair. It no doubt takes a lot of inspiration from Nintendo's kart racer, but it brings plenty of innovation to the table and makes for (arguably) a slightly more skilled contest with a little but less reliance on luck (though, of course luck still definitely plays its part). The tracks look fantastic and over each lap they slowly change allowing your kart to transform into a boat or aircraft when needed. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a huge improvement over it's predecessor (which you probably could call a “Mario Kart Clone”). It's fast, fluid & fun. If you're after a fun kart racer (or a fun game in general), I'd highly recommend  Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed.
My favourite game. It can take a while to get hang of, but once you know what are doing it's fantastic. Even after 11 years I swear I'm still finding stuff I've never seen before. Deus Ex is a game, that doesn't (for the most part) punish you for taking on objectives from a different angle, it encourages it. 10/10
