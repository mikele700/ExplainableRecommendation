OMG!!! this game really freaks you out! It is really dark the whole time, and the heartbeats and breathing of your character freaks you out even more. Furthermore, it is so hard that I had to set the difficult to Normal (I always set it to hard although I am new to the game), because battery runs out really fast. It freaked me out at the beggining so much that I had to look for gameplays in YouTube to know what was gonna happen and what to do, so I dont freak out when it happens.Totally recommend it, 10/10. Great graphics, great story and great ambientation. Totally worth it.
