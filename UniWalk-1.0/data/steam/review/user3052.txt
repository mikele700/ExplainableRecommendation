i play this alot warning most people well critiseize you if you are a free 2 play or not but don'y care about that enjoy mak in friends capturing points defending back stabbing and killing robots and geting hats miscs and wepeons to help you in fights.
battleborn or know has BB is good for any persone who loved to play borderlands to which i am not say people who love borderlands will love this but this games does take it's humor from borderlands. the colour on the maps are good but thanks to the voting system for pvp or pve you will get sick of the same map like in pvp incusion everyone picks overgrowth. the 25 or + depending when read is a very diverse group of charaters to play like a bird with a rocket launcher to penguin in a mechsuit . but the matchmaking has slowen down cause of overwatch or know as OW  bylooking the same and being advaveiced but back to the point.  like borderlands you can farms a boss for a legendary. one major diffence from BB and OW by health is BB heros take a good amount of damage to kill which makes it more rewarding killing a playerShould i buy BB?you should if you got friends wanting to play but if not i would still recomend i would give it a 8.5/10
th game is great but you might want a strong computer cause a mac book pro with windows it crash with mac and lag out with windows

this game is a bit unfair when you start soit is a bit a bad game but it is a beta/ early access game but there is only 1 game mode and you only get tech points if you get kills or win which is really hard when you ******* start and i did swear but i bleeped my self
this game is awsome if you don't have space for it get ring of space and you will be surprsed by how fun it is
