#1 tip: Don't Starve
basically, YES it's a great game and best for people who seek a feeling of satisfaction and relief after beating a part of a game after a couple deaths. The game really just throws you in the world beginning with a scene explaining the situation. There is no tutorial and no words in the game, leaving you to learn the game yourself (or roam a forum ;)). The game looks beautiful and runs smoothly. Now, there are some bugs. I've had a black screen that showed your character and only enemies and instant crash after death. The death and respawn time might make you get tilted a bit, too. Overall, buy it, it's great but maybe wait for a discount because it's a little pricey in my opinion.
