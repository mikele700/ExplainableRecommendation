A awesome straegy-hybrid where you have a ship and u control every thing that go's on. toput it in simple terms it is AWESOME
a AWESOME FPS full of shooting, startegy and AWESOME SAUCE!!!!Once u learn how to play u can start racking up kills fast.
OK so I'm trying to do my first playthrough complete stealth and non lethal so my inventory is full of low damage weapons like a tranq gun and silenced pistol. So when I got to the first boss i was totally unprepared. I was trying to do a hit and run tactic when I stumbled on a couple of turrets... I went into the control room nect door hacked into the security hub and turned them on to attack enemies. So i went outside picked one up and held it in front of me like a minigun and COMPLETELY overkilled the first boss!!!The stealth system is also really good featuring noise as a factor and using cover to try and hide yourself can make it very interesting. Combining with the fact that there are multiple ways to get to your objective it has a lot of replay ability. Its story is also very good, well written and should keep u intruigued.10/10 augumented bunnies
tis game is awesome. Period.
