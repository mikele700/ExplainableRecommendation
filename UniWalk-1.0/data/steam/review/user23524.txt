Specs WAY too demandingThis game fits more on console than pc
The comedy just never gets old no matter how many times i play this game... I find a different meaning to the jokes every playthrough, It surprises me valve actually made this! But when will portal 3 come???
So classic... so many heads coming off... so much gore
I can't believe how clunky the controls are in this game but in a way it is hilariously difficult especially while climbing
Unfortunately my internet isn't very stable with this game but until this is out of alpha it may continue to be this way...
When i first played this i was impressed how gruesome it was but still blowing up your enemies with grenades from a demoman just never gets old
Big shame only 4 new levels for campaign but still good enough but the price tag comes at a cost
