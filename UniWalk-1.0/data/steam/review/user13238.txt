Pros:- Very satisfying combat- Very fun with friends - 'The Following' DLC is awesome - Drive around in a buggy and feels much more open compared to the main campaign. - Great weapon customization- Parkour- Skill tree (agility, power etc..)- The more you progress the better the game gets- Grappling hook- Arab musicCons:- Voice acting- Start of the game can get boring, (however as you progress missions start to get better)- Minor bugs that can sometimes interrupt gameplay- Be the zombieIf you don't have friends, don't buy the gameIf  you have friends, you should buy and play this game asap.tyoverall: 9/10 with friends, 1/10 without friends <- you are going to have a bad time :(((((((((((((((
