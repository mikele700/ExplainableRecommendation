Incredibly broken/laggy in it's alpha state, but if you can look past these issues, you're gonna have a rad time. Not to mention ♥♥♥♥ yourself when you run into a guy wearing a Payday mask standing under a lamp-post in the middle of the night.
Enemies respawn the second they are off screen. What a ♥♥♥♥ing stupid idea. Especially when health is limited you take down a guy that makes you use all of your health packs only to find out after you pass him you've hit a dead end and have to immediately fight this ♥♥♥♥ again. Money well wasted on what could've been a great game, too bad it only takes one feature to ruin everything good about this.
I can sell all my DOTA items and use my steam wallet to buy Apohrodite skins!11/10 would steam market again.
