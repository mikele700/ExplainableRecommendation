Only played this on easy but OMG it was really awesome. I love the story line and I wish there were more metal gear games available on PC
Yes if you like graphic death scenes and enjoy being the spawn of satan. However the story line does take a while to set itself up and its easier if you are reading a walkthrough since you are searching a large house for your next victim and murder weapon.
Only place you forget to eat, sleep and drink just to eat, sleep and drink in the game. Plus you can kill dragons :)
