Awesomenauts is Awesome:D
Amazing game with one drawback, if you live in the US you will find about 3 servers, if you live anywere eles there are zero servers.As sad as it is to say, this game is dead.
Amazing shooter / platformer. Bleed uses it's platformer machanic and shooter machanic well, boss fights can be quite a challenge if you up the difticulty but is always fun.Worth your money, Obama recommend.
One hell of a movie, some many dis-like it's kind of cartoon looks but I liked it. One of few movies that left me happy for a long time and made me want more. This movie, even with it's budget beats alot of other movies.Also it's way cheaper then any movie in the cinerma can get you.
One of the best games of all time, I havn't played too much of this game, but the whole consept of the game is amzing and amzingly exercuted the only thing I is bad is the lack of players.Oh and if you have Ailenware computer the lights change colour too the map (You can turn this feature off).Best music ever 10 / 10 best game to waste your life on.
