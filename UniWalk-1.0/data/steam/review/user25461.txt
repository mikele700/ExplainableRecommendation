An absolute masterpiece....I am blown away with this absolute gem, and It's all well and good until the end (which I wont spoil) It really caught me off guard. Kyle, you're a genius. Words cannot explain how much I loved this game.Recommended to anyone and everyone, for those who haven't: PLAY THIS GAME NOW, for it will change your life.
