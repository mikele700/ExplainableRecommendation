How could I possibly summarise over 2000 hours of gameplay into a review?  I think it's the teamwork aspect that creates the social aspect of this game that doesn't exist anywhere else along with the depth in strategy created by the ship designs that keep this game fresh.  Also, the mine launcher.I'll try to remember to update this review when I hit 3000 hours.
Pros:- Seems like it would be funCons:- Crashes on game start
