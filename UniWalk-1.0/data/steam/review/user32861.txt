It was a good game up to a point. In a mission, part of it bugged out, the solution was to disable a hotspot. I tried to do that, with fully upgraded skills/powers for my level, and found it impossible. About 5 tries later I uninstalled the game. Not a very good way to sell your game, Deep Silver... If you can somehow push past the impossible missions, it's probably a very good game, otherwise, don't bother with it and get something better, like Saints Row The Third, or GTA V.
