is gud.can build heavy tank then destroy heavy tank.21?/10 would do it again
would be yes if this game didnt cost more than whats expected..should be renamed from 'tea party simulator' to 'extra chromesome simulator'its way too hard to play.
Absolutely Great game. No arguing that.I can say without hyberbole This is the unquestionable Lovechild of Warchunder, kerbal, microsoft flight simulator, robocraft, and every sandbox build games ever made. and this is better than all of them.Completely boundryless when they say the skys the limit there is no better game than this.  if it flies you can build it helicopters and certain time period planes, sweep winged planes cannards. the only down side is call it that with the game is there is no multiplayer yet, and The non diagetic guitar music will make your ears ring after a hour or so, but that can be muted. everyone whos calling the game bad must be deported to the middle east to see the definition of bad. And let me just say this game is and always will one of the best purchases i made since Garry's mod since they are games like this cannot possibly be bias and the Devs will actually let you have a voice! (Unlike others((WoT))
now i dont usally write reviews to games but this is beond belief. the models are clearly re-textured from earlier arma games. and there are only like 20 vehicles in game, and most of them you have to pay extra money to have them. seriously , why buy $50 for a game thats going to ask for more money for less stuff. the only good thing in the game is the charecter customizer and thats not much to be cared for.
