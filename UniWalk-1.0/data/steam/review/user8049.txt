This is an impressive and long-awaited game from the developers of Limbo. Beginning as a kid in the woods, the game immediately immerses you in a dark, disturbing world; each scene is aesthically stunning and the dark atmosphere is enhanced by score that delivers tension at the appropriate time. As you unravel the mystery of the world, the game strikes a balance between fast-paced, anxious survival and patient problem-solving. Death is often unexpected, though not gory; and you quickly learn from your fatal mistakes. Given that you can finish it in 4-5 hours, this is the type of game that you should play in one or two sittings, and let it take you away in what can be an existential experience.
