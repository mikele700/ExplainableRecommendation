What can i say. It's really one of the best games ever created. Graphics are unreal and outdo themselves again with the download content hd textures pack. Gameplay is close enough to all elder scrolls games as expected but has enough difference to previous elder scrolls titles. Huge world, Loads of free mods available, Huge amount of gameplay & quests.If you don't already have skyrim then buy it now dammit.I Rate This Game:Gameplay - 10Graphics - 10Overall - 10-----------------------------------------------------Rating Key (overall score) = 1-3 bad bad game 4-6 Good or at least some kind of fun 7-10 Great game highly recommended
