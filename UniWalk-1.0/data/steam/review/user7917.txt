I have clocked about 450 hours on coh2, many of which have been within the multiplayer of the game.Thumbs up:Replay system = Very niceCapture my interest in the WW2 eraGreat cover system that rewards smart, tactical play (mostly)Great units, from tanks to infy to planesGreat commander system that adds replayability to the gameVery good, diverse factionsGreat developers (sometimes)Patches attempting to improve gameThumbs down:MUST HAVE THE LIMITED EDITIONa lot of money to get all the content such as skins, commanders Etc.However, just like any other game, it has its times when a unit may be extremely useless/good and the many bugs, but these are sometimes quickly fixed or are still presentAll in all, my love for the WW2 era has kept me very interested in this game, as well as the competitiveness of the multiplayer side. 8.8-10
HOLY BALLSAny player interested in WW2, or hardcore shooters should drop everything and buy this game now. Realistic gun play, movement, TANKS? CUSTOM MAPS, VERY DEDICATED DEVELOPER. Everything you could want. Only problem is lack of players, however, most servers have some players on them. The developer is also quite slow, mainly because of the small size of the team.11/10
