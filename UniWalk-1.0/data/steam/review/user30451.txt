An MMORPG = Vindictus+Animated Graphics (nuff Said)
Quality Banter
Great Game, Brings Back Memories
All I can Say is, -ok-
A Clicking Game for a week, then afk for the rest of your life.
As A Visual Novel, This was somewhat soothing to enjoy, provides a peaceful atmosphere and is easy to read through
 A Game Everyone Plays due to the fact that it is Free, I would give it both a yes and a no, but because you have to choose.
wtf is this
