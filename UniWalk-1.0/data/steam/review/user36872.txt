H3 is a fantastic way to kill some time. The visuals are stunning and the attention to detail is ridiculous. We use the revolver to work out who’s doing the dishes.  Russian Roulette style. People complaining about the $20 price tag are just wingy tight asses, if you have the money to buy a VR headset and a computer with the power to run it you can afford to drop $20 on one of the best games you will play in VR. Also the developers are constantly adding new content.
The best experience I’ve ever had on a computer !Played it through in one sitting. Not because its short but because I could not stop and just had to know how it ended.worth every cent.Might not be best for people who have not lived. For an understanding of life is needed to appreciate this master peace.
