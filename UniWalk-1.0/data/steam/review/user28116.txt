While playing this game I-'ve learned to expand my vocabulary to -Oh sh*t, oh sh*t, oh sh*t!-Very Immersive 9/10
I was honestly surprised when I tried this out, Depth is a game that you don't come across regularly, think of it like evolved but with everything done right. The gameplay is solid, easy to pick up and pretty hectic. Keeping your cool while being stalked by player controlled sharks is a must. I would recommend playing it with friends, for me the experience was amazing with just one friend tagging along. But don't go on my word alone check out some gameplay videos to see if its for you. I had a blast I'd give it a 8/10
Whether its shooting the !@#% out of a brain dead potato while singing the national anthem in unison with your favourate chew toy. All I have to say is porridge. 8/10
