Ok, ok, i am a VietNamese and excuse me for the bad grammar, but i just have to write a review on this game. I have been playing minecraft for the last 4 years, and i love it, i go deep in to the code, do mods and stuff. i think this game have great potential, even better then minecraft, the idea of this game is great and the graphic is the thing i love. so i gonna talk about some pros and cons of this game that i have seen in this game:-Pros: it s better than minecraft at some point, the graphics, the crafting and building is better-Cons: well, if u go single player, u gonna feel a bit lonely, the world is a bit empty, nid more kind of ground plant, trees, mobs. ofc the game is new, the mobs and stuff is still behind than minecraft, but i hope the dev can add more cuz i think the mob, for now is good, but still a bit littleso yeah, a thumb up for the game, i gonna play it more and u should 2, i hope they ll addd more content to the game.
