Europa Universalis IV is a game in which you choose a nation that existed from late 1444 to the early 1800's. There is no real way to win the game, instead allows to to choose what you want to do. Invade Germany as Poland. Conqueror Europe as France. Colonise Australia as Russia. The list goes on and on. Many people buy this game believing that it will be the same or similar to the 4X style of games (Explore, Expand, Exploit, and Exterminate) and ending up not liking this game. If you believe this, I would not recommend this title due to you. Otherwise I would recommend Europa Universalis to you.
Top Quality Game. Fun while being difficult. 9.7/10
