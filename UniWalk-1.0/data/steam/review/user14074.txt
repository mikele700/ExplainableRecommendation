What can I say about this game other than it-'s beautiful. This game has clearly had quite a bit of thought put into as shown through the ace character development and comedy. Additionally it puts a refreshing spin on the RPG combat system that I felt really gave this game a sense of uniqueness along with everything i said prior. Over all Undertale is a game that will have you question your own morality when posed with choices, the most prevolent being to -FIGHT- or -MERCY- and even when it comes to seemingly mundane actions. A very powerful game, and one of my personal favourites of all time. Would highly reccomend to anybody, with or without an RPG background.
if you HAVN'T already got this game then, WHAT THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN DOING ON STEAM!
