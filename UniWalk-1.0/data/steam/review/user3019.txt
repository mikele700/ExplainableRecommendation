With an easy interface, shining graphics, this game is unlike any other MOBA (For which I believe it too be, even though it-'s 2d). The controls are simple, and easy to understand. The fairly nice amount of characters to play as and unlock gives the player a nice range to choose from, apart from the Starstom DLC and character skins. (Damn you DLCS! *shakes fist*) All the matches seem overall fair, and fun. The steam integration and controller support gives the player easier ways to play, by inviting people to matches or plugging in a controller to make it feel more like the console version. The futuristic music and decent voice acting is what really sets the feel for this game. When -You have killed an enemy- has been announced, you just get the great sensation of being able to conquer and level to greater ranks. This game overall is a simple, slightly tactical and fun game to play. Whether it-'s healing your team mates, obliterating enemy-'s or collecting solar (The games currency) you-'ll be sure to have an all around great experience.
