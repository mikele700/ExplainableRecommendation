I bought this game after playing Mount & Blade: Warband, I thought same people means another good game and at the time it showed promise. But over the time I've owned it, the updates and announcements have only really being bug fixing or removing planned updates. This game is definitely nowhere near complete, it is buggy, lacks playability, most would probably lose interest after 10 minutes. Devs have completely screwed this chance
