Pros- Pew Pew Pew Bang Bang Bang.. Skins!You actually Need Skill!... unlike codCons- Worst Hit Reg EverBullets go ever... besides your target Also you'll start to like to waste money on skins like tf2Bout sums it up
I'm going to keep it nice and simpleEz Thumbs up, Nice Visuals, Nice conversations, I love my self some horror games but this is the only game that has actually kept me on my toesThis was a gift from a friend so i didn't pay for it and i would say that this worth $15So lets get down to pros and consPros-Awesome Visualspretty good convos and audioCons$20no replayiblity Ending (No spoilers)Ok i don't see what wrong with the ending to be honest, its not the usual.The ending is what would most likely happen if fire watch was based in real life...
i have a problem where i finish everything that is possible within games and after 12 hours i still have a few things to doOthers May get Twice or even 3 times more game play out of this than me,i can say this game is amazing, beautiful and alot of other great things. But not perfect as you should expect from a early access.The people behind this game are so on to it that they have a build in Feed back Feature and not only that, you get and achievement for doing so.but yea, over all a 9/10 for absolutely everything within this gameKinda like Minecraft, Space engineers and the long dark staged underwater, But cooler and more awesome
