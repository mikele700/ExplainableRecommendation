So, My freind told me to get this game, so all night we olayed and played until i was punching the walls and i raged so much, i played all day of the next day
Great game, like a 2D version of MC but better and more things to do.
One of my Prisoners killed all of my guards with a food tray and bashed down a solitary door and ran to freedom!10/10
This Game Is Ok i was expecting more but yea it is F2P
This game is a very good FP shooter, you get to fly planes, drive and use a tank, join a sqaud. In all i think this game has got me addicted again :D
Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has a great single player story line, you are the dragonborn and whenyou kill a dragon you obsorb the dragons soul. If you get bored or you have finished the game you can download DLC some of them are -Dragon Born- and many more that give you new items, achivements, storylines, and more ablities!One of the best games that is fantacy with dragons, trolls and much much more!In conclusion i truly recomend this game-Lincolndb
