I dont usually write many reviews but In my opinion, this game is definiitely worth taking the time to write one up.My apologies if its a little cluttered, confusing or has spelling mistakes as Im in a bit of a rush.                                                          Pros / Things I enjoy about this game : - Many options to choose when creating a new custom race when beginning a new game.Which makes us gamer/customers feel more respected that we get to choose things like our own starting species, species names, council names, ships, starting weapons for starting planet, flags and designs, and the way we run ourselves as a goverment which will affect our relationships with other species we come across.For example, if we allow purging a colony on a world I just took over due to them being too difficult >:) and allowing slavery or slavery of robots. Or choosing to go against those ways completely and give other species their freedom and also robots the option of freedom and their own free will.The possibilities are endless.- After colonizing you can choose on the factions tab on the far top left in which you can choose to give the people/ species of that planet their freedom to govern themselves as a new empire/team. Which after doing so you are immediatley their protectorate.In which after you can give them their freedom.So in short, you can create other teams throughout the game... How good is that! :D- Game chooses the way the graphics are im fairly sure depending on your machine and what it can handle.The graphics are amazingly beautiful on my machine :O- The Price of this game is extremely cheap compared to what you can do in it and how long it will amuse strategy fans...Im completely hooked and im so happy about the price i paid for this game. What a bargain!- Battling is great fun to watch, and how it will turn out but there is also a con to this pro also :P- There are many Diplomacy choices to pick from including : Insulting someone, choose them to be your Rival, call of war, asking for peace, create an alliance, Become a protectorate or ask another team to be yours, Sending resources, technology, space explored and many others.- Custom Ship--defence structure design is Amazing. Many options to pick from like :Choosing the name of the shipMany Weapons to choose fromAddons like armour, Power cores, ShieldsSections of the ship in the way it will look and what and how many weapon and addon slots they come with.                                                       Mix between Cons / My Constructive Critisicm : - It would be good to have some more character customization options at the start. Likes clothes and also additional options, for example slight face changes and clothes (Armor which represents a war like species, or gowns which represent a more peaceful species - which there are some already in it but would be good to have some more cooler looking ones)Also maybe being able to change the way our characters look throughout a game, like hair and clothes..My character could want a haircut or decide to change his clothe once in a while as he feels hes starting to smell a bit like Poopoo :P- Ships are very close together when battling, it would be good if the spacing was a bit more battle friendly on the eyes.And maybe letting us move our ships when in a battle instead of the computer taking over completely for us to just watch and hope the computer goes about the battle in the most strategic way possible.For example, if my ship has long range weapons i may wish to keep a distance from the enemy.While as when the ai takes over it may not move away from the enemy and stay within the enemies medium range weapons which is definitely not the strategy I would have taken as I came out of the battle with my ship destroyed and the battle lost :(A tiny bit hard to pick up at first with so many options and things to choose from and how the user wants to go about conducting themselves as a nation. But once you've picked it up its completely awesome. Just hang in there and keep at it as its definitely worth it! Trust me- This is a fairly small con but still im a little picky. The different Zooming stages can be a little annoying to change between to get the view i was happy with.Maybe creating a few more zooming stages which are closer together with using the mouse wheel would be good.                                                                               Summary :Thats about all i can think of for now. There are many many more things that I love about this game, but i have things to do now, for example, start up Stellaris :DSo yeah I definitely Recommend this game.If youre thinking whether or not to buy this game, Buy it! Im sure any space or strategy game fan will love it.Have fun and Peace out Steam Community :)I give Stellaris : 9/10
I was going to wait until i wrote a review but i decided to write one now anyways.Deus Ex sets off located in the Exciting atmosphere of Prague.There are plenty of of side quests which seem to make a difference in the story and have meaning behind them.The main story plot seems slightly limited however compared to the various mini stories going on both aboveground and underground.The world of Deus ex mankind divided is quite large to some extent with being able to enter many buildings which makes you feel like it is your playground to do as you wish.It makes the player feel as if they are a super agent able to take down any security system and any enemy force that stands in their way.There is not a vast amount of weapoons to choose from which is kind of a letdown, however whatever weapons there are to choose from, are able to be tuned/upgrades such as adding a silencer for a more stealthier approach but has its setbacks with stopping force.Or adding a scope to increase distance and make things a bit easier when aiming.New experimental Augmentations add to the feeling of being unstoppable which makes the game more exciting.I wont ruin it by listing any..Ill let you find those out for yourself as its well worth checking into.Hand to hand combat is limited to the pressing of a button or holding that button to either incapacitate/neutralise the target or assassinate them.This I feel could of been worked on a bit more to give players the feel as though they are more in control of what happens during a fight instead of having to watch the same old actions made by the computer which can get to be a bit dull after time.In deus ex, there is always either two or more ways to approach things in every situation.With gaining entrance to areas :-There is to a degree a parkour type feel to it with being able to jump over obstacles and scale window ledges to get into hard to get or secret areas..most with the help of you Unlocked new super augmentation powers. Which is why it is always best to unlock as many as you can, as soon as possible.-By taking the head on approach and hack your way in which can be a bit more dangerous.-Or by maybe finding as secret back or side entrance if you have the patience or tallent to find spot these things.Personally I find all options interesting and fun, so I try to mix it up a bit to test myself at all times.I like the fact that There are at times when you must communicate with NPC's by maybe trying to reason with them or by flat out insulting them.This, plays a part on what will happen next, whether it be you heading into a gunfight with them, or you both coming to a peaceful reasonable understanding. There is a cover system implemented which is also enjoyable when sneaking into areas by stealth and also in gunfights however does have a slight linear feeling to it.However if the enemy spots you and manages to reach the alarm, you could be in all sorts of trouble as you find yourself shortly surroundednear by nearby soldiers.There is always a reset to fixing these minor to major problems by resetting the alarm which will defuse the situation. I dislike how they have implimented the in game purchasing to buy either credits (In game currency) or Praxis (Aug Points) Also with unlocking/purchasing the weapon/item DLC, once you unlock it, you can only use these on one game.So once you create a new game, you dont have those DLC weapons or item again for another playthrough which is a major ripoff.They Devs should not be allowed to do this to their customers.I have a Intel Core i7-6700 4.00Ghz, 32gb ram and a Nvidia Gtx Titan X Graphics card which I can set the graphics on everything to ultra with barely any framerate issues. It seems to play smooth however i have not tested my actual framerate.I can play with MSAA on to x2, however it does to a degree have that slow response lag feeling which takes it toll on the framerate.Anything over x2 and it absolutely kills the framerate and ruins the game for me.So for gameplay sake, I leave it turned off.Like I said, I have only played 21 hours or so, there is lots more to mention but at the moment this is all i could think of bringing up so far.Later on down the track I may update my review on my experience with playing Deus Ex mankind divided. I would recommend this game to people that enjoy First person shooters, that enjoy Shootouts with multiple enemies and Stealth takedowns with sneaking around  into areas that you perhaps should or shouldnt be and being crafty then this game is definitely for you.I give Deus Ex Mankind Divided : 8/10
Excellent short clip, Great acting, visuals and graphics and the short storyline was put together great and meshed well.Would definitely watch this if it was a series or movie
The Campaign starts off in 272 BC with Nine playable nations/factions and  dozens of others including Britannia, Carthage, Macedon, Seleucids and many more including some included in Culture Packs (DLC) like Sparta, Athens and Epirus. Rome ofcourse being the primary Vanilla starting nation.This game is purely grand strategy with almost every character and faction having their own unique personalities of their own as to how they conduct themselves as a nation whether it be passive or aggressive, Tretcherous or Loyal.Each choice has a consequence however, opinions and hatred can be mended over time.Diplomacy plays a part in the game but I felt that it was lacking to some what a degree and could have been worked on more.I missed being able to hand over my land and towns to my less fortunate brother factions that could use an extra helping hand to later on help me out in tough situations and to make things a little easier for me with not having to manage so many towns.There is a technology tree which allows techological advancements in military training to unlock new and stronger units to add to the recruitment list and upgrade such things as the damage they inflict to their maximum defence and moral, Also Town and resource advancements which help with the upkeep of your mighty armies.Units are now recruited by generals as well which spare them from having to travel so far to the barracks which in so saves quite a few movement points.All armies must be accompanied by a general and arent allowed to travel alone like in previous total war titles which for me is a bit of a let down. I personally loved that part of the game, with being able to have armies march themselves and then when a soldier has proved himself, he then be promoted to general of that army if it be noticed that he had what it takes.There is also much more variety of stances, among them is the option to forify with the armies own small wooden fence to provide an extra amount of small protection from the attacking army.Or you may decide to take the sneaky tactical route and decide to lay an ambush. However, choose carefully on where and when you decide to go about these new implementations as the weather conditions and terrain can play a heavy roll on the battle.The Interface is quite neat and tidy I found and fairly easy to get used to.Battles start with two armies facing off, however at times other allied or enemy armies if in the same vicinity may join in on a battle which can also play a big part in the odds of the victor.The Graphics/visual textures and sounds are quite stunning and breathtaking from the sound of the arrows whooshing through the air all the way to a group of stampeding angry elephants on their way to trample your tiny Roman cohort soldiers. Will the stenght and brute force win the battle for the enemies war elephants, or strategic military tactics of boxing in them with your brave cohort decide the winner?With saying that, there are those annoying and fustrating parts of the game which from experience I would Naval warfare or times where the enemy may camp at the end of their kingdom which can even take some time with the fast forward option enabled.From My experience playing this game, I loved playing with Sparta the most as it reminds me so much of Leonidas and his mighty 300.I love how i can slow my battles down to see my mighty armies march in synch, get into formation ready to stop a group of charging horsemen, dare i say even a general performing a decapitation blow on an enemy soldier in to some what degree one on one fight engrosed by their following armies.This game is a must For people who love their historical strategy games.My rating for Rome 2 is 10/10 and I definitely recommend it even though i thought the diplomacy menu was a slight let down.Im sure there are many more things I could have included in my review, but this is all I could think of, off the top of my head.I give Rome 2 Total War : 10/10
Sandbox gameplay best played with the user creating their own unique experience.Can be quite dull following the main storyline in a straight line though.Just cause 3 has a vast amount of towns and lovely scenery and has a quite large map to explore.There are Lots of tools for creating destruction throughout the world of Just cause 3, and the Explosions of certain buildings and other destroyable objects look amazing. However not everything is destructible.Among thing that are able to be destroyed are fuel tanks and power generators, which are easily to destinguish that are marked in red and are scattered throughout towns and military area, but you can also collapse weak looking structures like guard towers, gas stations and even certain bridges which is quite cool.You can Hijack pretty much any enemy vehicle.Enemies are quite easy to take out (terrible AI) and their aim is shocking XDDecent game, however, personally  i was expecting something more.Theres Not as many weapons which i would have liked there to be which is a bit of a disappointment.Game just seems like it stuck at one pace all the time..Fast. Kind of wish there was a slower/stealthy implementation included as well.It kind of feels like, just run around, shoot and kill so to speak, which dont get me wrong, theres a lot of people out there which would love this kind of gameplay.To the fans that like this series or love fast paced action games, I would recommend it.If you dont have a gamepad, i would really consider getting one to play this game as it is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to control with the keyboard.GRAPHICS : I have read quite a few reviews of people saying they are having issues with graphics that it runs terribly, the frame rate drops and visuals are the same as Just cause 2.Me Persoanlly, I have had little to no problems what so ever. No freezing, no crashes, no frame rate drop or anything. Runs really smooth.Perhaps they hadnt updated their graphics drivers so their card would be optimized for Just cause 3, or perhaps they have a card not best optimized for the game..Who knows.All in all, I kind of feel like theres no much differnece between Just cause 3 from Just cause 2. I played it yesterday and when i woke up this morning I didnt exactly feel the need to play it :/I rate Just Cause 3 : 7/10
Great Game, Very addictive.A great deal of depth in the storyline. I Love how there how there are lots of options to choose from when having conversations and choosing different conversation topics.I also love the dismemberment and decapitations in it as well.And Massive multiple Maps with lots of Quests It's great it has mod support too.Awesome game 9/10
I was very disappointed when rockstar didnt bring GTA V out for pc around the same time they did with Xbox 360 and PS3. And didnt understand why they at the time.The 1-2 years extra wait was definitely worth it in every way. Great storyline.Awesome that it has 1st and 3rd person which beats console versions of the game.Controls are smooth and easy to get used to..or was for me.Plenty of vehicles to drive and plenty of upgrades for them too, same goes with weapons.Some of the clothing is a bit lame looking and could be improved though as well as more tattoos to choose from and maybe some more hair cuts.Love this game for action and comedy at its best and not to mention the Strip club ; ) Mod support for this game steps it up too.It makes it an entirely different experience on top of what it already is.It's always great when a dev allows mod support. The only thing that disappoints me is not being able to create our own character.That's always what I keep hoping will happen.Hopefully eventually they will implement this.I give Grand Theft Auto V : 10/10
