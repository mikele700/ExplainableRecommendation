ok,So I've been able to find the games, and it's now one of my main streaming game on my stream at the moment. The game is fun to play. However, some mechanicals still need to work on the game, here is oneBleeding to death seem like a penalty to the survivor rather than the killer because on some games, I've been left like that by the killer because I've removed all the hooks (except the dungeon ofcourse) and there is no way he can't hang me up. So he let me bleed, and I didn't earn any score from that. I think if the killer let the survivor bleed to death, they should be penalised to lose points.Aside from that, more variety in game mode would be fun also. A good game to play, as I recommend if you wanna buy it :)
