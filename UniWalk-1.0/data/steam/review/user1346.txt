Competes with Team Fortress 2 in the amount of time I've spent playing Dress-up unironically.
This game, for me, was a real gem. Admittedly, I am not a big fan of puzzle games that involves a stealth mechanic, but with the unique mechanic that is the 'Crosslink' system, the game becomes a lot less of just waiting and moving and waiting and moving, but instead becomes more like setting up a complex mouse trap that incapacitates every guard in the building with the flick of a switch. And that's where the fun comes from, not the hiding and the stakes of being found, but trying to find the quickest and easiest way to the objective through utilisation of the environment. The story is clever, well written, but short. the level design is top-notch, and with the implementation of a steam workshop supported level editor, I can see a much longer playtime through the various community levels.Oh, and you get a TF2 hat.So, even if you don't like stealth games, there's a demo that you can test the water with. And you never know it might just be that one good game you never see comin.g
