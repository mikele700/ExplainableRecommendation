Insurgency is a shooter like no other. Insurgency has a very strict weight protocol where you can't just deck yourself out with an AT-4 or RPG without losing armour, secondary, chest rig/carrier and your primary. The supply points system is a very genius idea because it adds in a level of difficulty for example you have the choice of a burst fire M16A4 (costs 1 supply point) or a fully automatic M4 (costs 4 supply points), depending on your choice you can have more attachments like sights, barrel attachments, flashlight/laser sight or bipod, fore grip and grenade launcher (depending on the class). If you donâ€™t like playing with others around the world just yet you can play by yourself or with other players against bot enemies (co-op).Insurgency's combat is very tactical and requires teamwork to succeed, running around guns blazing will just kill you, so find cover and be patient! Their damage model is very unforgiving as two shots with and gun will kill you or one headshot.Insurgency is one of or the best most realistic shooter there is. Playing triple A titles like Call Of Duty get boring as kills are easy to get, Insurgency is different getting kills is a lot harder than you may think, you could go a whole round without getting kills which is not very surprising.I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants something different to the triple A titles or if you want to get your first shooter.
this is such a great game this is the perfect game for people who like to skrew around
