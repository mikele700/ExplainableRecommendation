Most emersive game i have ever played. If you have ever wanted to experience what it is like to go hunting you have to play this game, the graphics are fantastic and i have had no preformance issues... so far.a really big downside is that it is free to play meaning basically all the good elements of the game require in game purchases with real money. this frustrates me as to have a good gaming expierience you would have to pay at least $10 for a hunting license and about $5 for a good gun. A game like this shouldn't be free to play but a one off purchase as it would allow more people to get involved and overall make the experience more worthwhile.
