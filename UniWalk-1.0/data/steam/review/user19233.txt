I once killed someone by throwing a smoke grenade into their head.That was nice.
I thought it said Among Nipples.
I don't understand all the fuss about the microtransactions.They're amazing! Nothing is better than being able to pay real money to be better than other people, even though its a PvE game! I also find the fact that we were promised no microtransactions for whatever reason, but then received them amazing! Gosh, microtransactions and pay2win games are the best! :Dim kidding, im not an idiot
This is the single best single player game I've ever touched. Story: 10/10Gameplay: 9.5/10Sound: 10/10Visuals: 10/10I'm not usually a book reader, but this game has gotten me to start reading the books that inspired it.If you don't like it you're a nerd.
It takes all the bad things from the original 2033, and replaces them with some of the good things from Last Light.It's nice.
A HIDEO KOJIMA GAME
i ate a rotten banana and didn't die1/10
This is a really good game. Dunno about the co-op though. Never had the luxury of having someone to play it with.
I don't like sports or cars, and I'm awful at this game. 9/10, pretty fun
