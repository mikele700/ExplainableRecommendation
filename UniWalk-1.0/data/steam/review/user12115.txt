Dont Starve is a brilliant game and playing with friends just makes it all the better.However there have been some pretty large changes and additions from the base game that alot of people do not like, so dont expect the game to work and be exactly as the solo game. But otherwise I think this game will be perfect once the Through the Ages DLC comes out.
If you were left feeling a little let down after Dont Starve's meh Shipwrecked DLC then you will be overjoyed by The Flame in the Flood. I think It's basically what Klei wanted to do with Shipwreked but coudn't. The Nomadic survival gameplay that they tried to push with the new characters is exactly what this game nails as you are forced to progress in order to survive.
Now that I've finally finished the Walking Dead series, the invisible onion cutting people have left :*(
