Always a sense of movement and SOMETHING happening. I recommend you have a keyboard or GC controller, as it is very much a -Balls to the walls- racing game. It-'s a mix between the high speed action of F-Zero and the randomness and questionability of Mario Kart.The game is good and music is great, I play on minimum settings (GEForce 430) and get a good framerate (rarely drops below 75), but the game still looks good, and definitely plays well with a keyboard. I recommend that if you-'ve played F-Zero (or even if you haven-'t but find it interesting) that you try this game. I picked it up in beta for $4 and even now, at $10, it is worth every cent I reckon.Screenshot of minimum settings[puu.sh].
10/10 Gameplay, 11/10 Music, EXTREMELY SMALL download (linux is <40 MB).
Great, if you're using Windows.Not so much if you're using SteamOS or any other distro of Linux.I'm saying this as I've recently switched to Ubuntu Linux as it runs faster on the same programmes, in a higher resolution.
