Rogue Legacy satisfies people wanting a new Metriodvania, with a pinch of rogue like elements to keep it fresh. Responsive controls and satisfying combat make this a fantistic indie game that everyone should give a go...just make sure you use a controller. 9/10.
A classic PC First Person Shooter with a very strong user base, and is legendary on steam, and for good reason. It's chaotic, funny and addictive, with great class balance and fun modes galore. Still the best FPS I have ever played, if not one of the best games ever. 10/10.
