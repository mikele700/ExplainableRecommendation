Addictive as crack
Amazing, not that great with humor but Awesome 10 hoffs out of 10
When i first played far cry 2 on the ps3, I disliked it, I didn't even know about the first one so i traded it for brothers in arms hells highway or whatever the reason i got rid of it fast talking the npc's couldn't take a breath and the 2nd people just attacked me for no reason. Couple years later i got far cry 3 and i loved it but then i thought lets replay fc2 looked all over forgot that i traded it for another game , blamed my brother and sister for selling it. Now 2014 the december sale arived and i saw far cry 2 was only $2.00 alright i might get my chance to replay this game and guess what?? I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!.
it may be a good game but its pay to win and i dont like that.
