As Markiplier said SCARIEST GAME IN YEARS and he was right. This is one of the scariest games i have ever played.I reccomened this game to anyone who like scary games.
good
   Wargame: European Escalation One of the best wargame games i have ever played at a very reasonable price!I recommend this game for people who like the Call of Duty franchise or if you want to try something new Great game 9/10 (Just some bugs like you cant move you allies)
