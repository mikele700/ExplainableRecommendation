-Rep, Rockstar being rockstar again and not letting anyone mod their game...-RepDont Buy.
Everyone You see seems to Kill On Sight.i spent 30mins trying to get into a server, i would get in then drop my weapon to get another weapon and the server would crash. so i just lost both of my guns. Would not recommend worst game ive played
Love this game, recommended to anyone that likes War/Millitary games. Played over 1700 hours
