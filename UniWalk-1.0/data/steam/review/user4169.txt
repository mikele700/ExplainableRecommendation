Love this game and all it's mind ♥♥♥♥ery, if you're a big fan of optical illusion n ♥♥♥♥, you'd love what this game has to offer. Not only does it include sick ♥♥♥ illusions, but it's also a kickass puzzle game.
Seriously, I can-'t recommend this game enough, the developers are super awesome with their community interaction and they do not hold back on content updates.The gameplay is constantly entertaining whether you-'re fighting a giant robot death worm or building a nice little houseThere is so much content in this game that even after having played it for over 400 hours, I can still look at an item I-'ve not seen before and think -The ♥♥♥♥ is this?-.The endgame is so satisfying to get to after collecting all of the items you need for the highest tier items, you-'ll find yourself with a shoulder mounted Space Dolphin Machine Gun or a giant prismic magic laser thing.After having owned this game for years now and loved every minute of it, I would strongly urge every human and other species to play this game.
