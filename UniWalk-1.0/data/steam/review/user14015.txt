One of the best RPG's I have ever played. I put it up there with Skyrim and FF7 legendary status. This game will keep me going for a long time and it will forever be a game I will remmeber.
Would buy twice... I felt like I almost lived this game I enjoyed it that much!!!! Worth every cent.
This game might not have th best graphics but it is by far one of the most moving stories I have ever known. It holds a Epic level of story telling that Game of thrones books have.The game is only 4 hrs long but you cannot pass something so amazing I wish I had $10 to send it to everyone. Now consider me a FreeBirdGaming Groupie
