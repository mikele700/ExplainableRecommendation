This may very well kill what made the elder scrolls stand out on the PC.Modders have worked in the past on the basis of collaboration to make great things. That won't be possible here.On top of that bethesda and steam think they are owed a 75% cut for what may include none of their original assets. Think again.
Best of the series in my opinion. People used to the newer versions might have trouble adapting to the dated graphics and it seems to run at 1.5 speed on PC. Otherwise it's definatly worth playing.
It can be great fun but it's major downside comes from the number of twelvies that play
It left an impression, a good one. It left me wanting more at the end which I consider to be a good and a bad thing. Interesting visualsSimplistic combat and platformingInteresting story
