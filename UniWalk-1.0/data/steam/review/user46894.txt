LOVE. IT. Runs so much smoother than the one on mobile devices which I must have hundreds of hours on by now. I'm already downloading recording software for use on my YouTube channel. xDMy channel: www.youtube.com/user/iMrPhyto
[EDIT] I have since solved this problem!!! I have windows 7, here's how to fix the problem (It's very easy). Simply hover your mouse over Trove on the taskbar and it should show you a 'preview' of what's meant to be on your screen now, simply right-click on the small slot and click 'maximise'. Then it will show up! I believe that it was just so tiny that I couldn't see it or press maximise. [EDIT]10/10 would get a game that shows you the intro screen.1. Started listening to the most amazing electro / dance mix ever.2 . Spent half an hour getting past Glyph's security measures (Although that was mostly my internet spazzing out).3. Was basically told that my password was awful.4. Finally signed up for Glyph and Trove.5. Installed Trove which was relatively quick.6. Opened the Glyph homepage for Trove.7. Noticed that you couldn't put it in fullscreen which didn't matter as it was the homepage.8. Was excited to finally play Trove.9. Opened Trove and pressed play but nothing happened. Sound was there and it said it was open but nothing except the homepage was on my screen.10. Finished listening to the most amazing electro / dance mix ever.Disappointed as it was an amazing looking game and had such good reviews, if anybody knows how to fix this could you please add me? :)
Ahah! Feels good to have gotten early access. Got all the DLC and for only $10 :D
