I truly like this game so far! (MR8 X3)   A friend of mine introduced me to it... and it turned out to be really addictive :3THe graphics are cool (although I play with 1.80 Dual Core, 4 GB of RAM and a Nvidia GeForce 8500GT.... )   and I like the gameplay system, it's free, there's no lines or paths to follow, you make your own :3Dunno, I like ^^
