THIS ♥♥♥♥ IS ♥♥♥♥ING FUN ♥♥♥♥ MAN. YOU NEED TO BUY THIS. YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN FROM OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT ALL THE BUGS, KINKS AND ANNOYANCES THUS FAR (REFER TO OTHER REVIEWS). THE BIGGEST THING FOR ME IS THE PLAYING WITH FRIENDS, OR LACK OF IT.. FOR NOW (HOPEFULLY??) ALSO SORT OF ANNOYING THAT THERE ISN'T ANY SORT OF CHAT SYSTEM OR EVEN A VOICE SYSTEM AT ALL. THERE'S BOTH PROS AND CONS TO THIS. POINTS SYSTEM IS HORRID FOR BOTH SIDES AND CAN EASILY BE ABUSED (SEE OTHER REVIEWS FOR ME DETAILS). BUT OVERALL THIS ♥♥♥♥ IS ♥♥♥♥ING FUN LOL. AND IT HAS GIVEN ME A FEW JUMP SCARES SINCE I PURCHASED IT AND DEFINITELY GETS MY HEARTBEAT UP A BIT WHEN THE KILLER IS NEAR AND THE HEARTBEAT SOUND STARTS PLAYING.YOU SHOULD STILL BUY THIS GAME AT 15 DOLLARS WHICH IS A PRETTY GOOD DEAL I THINK. I'M SURE IT WOULD BE A LOT MORE POPULAR IF IT WENT ON SALE FOR 10 THOUGH. SIDENOTE: IT DOESN'T LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN A 5 DOLLAR GAME TBH AND AT TIMES SEEMS TO PLAY LIKE ONE AS WELL BUT I'M HOPING THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED IN COMING UPDATES. BUT IT CERTAINTLY PLAYS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED IT AND I AM GLAD I GOT IT FOR $15.99.

LOL YOU SHOULD BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥, IT'S ONLY 89 CENTS DURING STEAM SUMMER SALE AND IT'S WILD FUN PLAYING WITH FRIENDS LOL. LOTS OF LAUGHS TO BE HAD FOR EVERYONE.
Awesome game with friends. Playing with random people generally sucks until you play several missions with them and break the ice. But it's definitely worth buying while its on sale!
