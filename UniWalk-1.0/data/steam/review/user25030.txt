This is most literally the best game I have ever played. It was sent to me by my local pastor and he told me that after experiencing the joy of Uriel-'s Chasm the light of Jesus would shine through my loins. I feel priveleged to have experienced this absolute masterpiece, and I wish that everyone on steam could experience the same euphoria as me. Thank you Uriel-'s Chasm, for showing me the light. To reinforce my review, here are some reviews from others -A bad game. Un-skip-able cut-scenes, bad voice acting, weird and incoherent story, uber religious, and no tutorial. The first level is unplayable. I have to shoot asteroids and read bible verses to increase my faith, but don-'t let the spinning fleshy mouth thing touch me, or I die?- -Elvis-This game is one of the reasons why intelligent extraterrestrial life forms are omitting planet Earth. Pros: - in some parallel universes this game never came into existence Cons: - it exists in our universe- -Doctor Pepper-This is the worst game i ever played! And i have played lots of games!- -League of Legends
