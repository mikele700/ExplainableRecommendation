I've played a lot of zombie games in my time, but Killing Floor is by far the most intense. When you have your back to the wall, facing down a Fleshpound and a Scrake, with nothing left but a knife and dead teammates, it really makes your adrenaline kick in. The fact that this game is generally focussed on (but not limited to) multiplayer and teamwork is what makes it that much more enjoyable. Why face hordes of endless flesh-eating creatures alone, when you can share the fun of burning them, blowing them up and hacking them apart with a team? The wide variety of weapons, maps and enemies  really adds to the enjoyment that I got (and continue to get) out of this game.
