I sat in a tank for 2 hours. Mowing down anyone i saw. Then My Outfit Rushed an outpost. There was around 200 odd people. My FPS was stable. Then i saw 20 dudes huddled up. I got out my rocket laucher. My frames went from 80 to 15.10/10 Would drop Againn.
Lets just say i ran around naked as the heavy. 8/8 would streak again
Very fun, well optimised, and rather pretty to look at. When the goty edition is on sale. PICK IT UP.
EVERYONE NEEDS TO PLAY THIS. I played it like i would play mass effect. Try and bone her. DONT.Its not like that. The little things are what makes it imersive. The statuses contain lyrics that i know. Very sad. Dont let that put you off though. It is what makes it great. The last of us is sad yet everyone loves it. So why not this game. This beats MGS V and Fallout 4 For story of the year.
JUST MOD THIS GAME
It was Really Good. AND I HATE THINKING
This game. Lets just say i was running arround as Tyrial From Diablo. With the buster sword from ff7. My companion was a anime girl with frostmorne. MOD THIS GAME!! People are saying its ♥♥♥♥ compaired to skyrim because they have not modded it. Graphics are bad. ENB. The Story is odd. SIDE QUESTS. The world looks the same. BETTER CITYS. Armor looks bad. EVERY ARMOR MOD EVER. Its too hard. Suck it up.8/8- Would be a prisoner scum again.
Its overwelmingly fun. You must get into the beta though, your missing out. Workshop. New Hud and More!
This Game. Ugh. This is why my family hates me. Then i showed my sister.I cant use my computer now.
Think of this as a game. A GAME THAT YOU CAN MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING BACKFLIP OFF A BUILDING IN SLOW MO WHILE SHOOTING SOME CHEAP RICO RODREGUZ KNOCK-OFF IN MID AIR. 8--8-IGN WOULD BACKFLIP AGAIN
