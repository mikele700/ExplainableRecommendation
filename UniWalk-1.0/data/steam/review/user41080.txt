This game is INCREDIBLE. It is so vast and beautiful and will make you gasp with awe as you see the land. It has so many quests as well and it feels endless. I love how when you finally (if ever) run out of quests, the open world allows you to make up your own. The combat is a thrill and i never tire of it. Learning new magic always makes me get so excited and  I love the range of spells alot. This game has so many choices and options and it truely is a game worthy of the title, incredible.
Mass Effect 2, a thrilling mix of brilliant gameplay and especially excellent storytelling mechanics. This game has kept me interested at every corner. I never lost interest in the brilliant choice making the allowed you. I especially loved the fact that depending on what you chose in certain missions affected your future outcome in later games like Mass Effect 3. This series of games has got to be my utter favorite that I have ever played. I cannot describe the joy I felt, customising my armour, having brilliant dialoge with my crew and doing the excellent missions that were given. This game, and those that preceed and come after it, excite me for the way games are going and where they will end up. In the end the only thing I can say is that I am intently waiting with great anticipation for the next game, Mass Effect 4.
