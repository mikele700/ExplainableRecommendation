A fun MMO game on steam that has a 3rd person feel to it, whilest still having 1st person view involed. it even has a TV series, but not sure if they are based the same. still a fun game for all you MMO, 1st person, 3rd person or adventureus game players:D
ive played thsi for awhile now and the only gliches or error i-'ve seen is the servers cut out. there are some bugs with the graphics and characters but my computer is probably the reason for it as i have to have the settings to the lowist.other then all of these the game shows real potential to becoming a good game out of beta. i really like the stealthy part of the game as its quite challenging to get past the Nethers and other hostile mobs, including other players.keep up the good work -Nether-!And Game On!
it's price/s are cheap and affordable, as i got all the DLC's including the game for $14-$18... of cousre it was on sale, but still affordable
