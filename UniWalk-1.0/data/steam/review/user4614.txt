Best tom clancy game. Good graphic, a lot of weapon and characters. The game is a combination between csgo (tactical and game mode), dota 2 ( abilities ), TF2 ( class or maybe call Operator). But the problem is the loading system is too long, a lot of glitches. And the funny thing is why all the operators can't jump ?
yup, it is a good game. Full of blood, gut and meat fly everywhere. I like the double barrel shotgun, that is my personal weapon. One terrible thing is there is no control option to change button to play it easy, i played the free version on my old computer.
worst game, horrible graphic, enemy kill me from no where
Old classic game ?!?! I am on, best sandbox game. Full of blood and gore. Body part fly everywhere, even i can explode the city. I can kill Osama Binladen. I like double barrel shotgun
I am a blood fan
Awesome game
