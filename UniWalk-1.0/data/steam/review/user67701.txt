It might seem reduntent to give prais to this game, seeing how many people play this game. But I just want to give my opinion as a person who is not in to the hardcore PC crowd. This game is a ture marvel, great gameplay, characters, weapons, map, and a distinct art and graphical presentation that I believe can work on a wide veriety of PC setups. In short, I would recomend this game to everyone with a PC. And if you like hats, you are going to have a good time.
