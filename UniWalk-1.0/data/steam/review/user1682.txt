This game is wonderful. It's free, why are you even looking in the reviews? You are literally losing nothing by picking this up and trying it for yourself. I don't play it often, but every time I do I'm glad to have it in my library, and I always have a great time playing it. That's what I thought about it, but again, it's free. There is no reason at all whatsoever not to try it for yourself.
You should have gotten it while it was $5.
One of the best story driven games I've ever played. The combat is incredible and the gameplay is smooth, the cutscenes are nice (though a bit small) and the writing is pretty good. The item system is awesome, the abilities you get throughout the game are actually relavent all over the map, traveling is incredibly easy and.... BUY IT. IT WAS 3.00$ IN THE STORE FOR STEAM SUMMER SALE. WHY DIDN'T YOU BUY IT THEN. BUY IT NOW ANYWAY, BECAUSE IT'S AMAZING. IT'S CHARMING. IT'S FUN. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME IS AMAZING. I reccomend this game. gandalfjesusridingabreadasaurusrexridingamassivevelociraptorontopofamassivespacechickenturtle/10. buy it. now.
