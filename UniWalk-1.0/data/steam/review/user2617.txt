Great racing game, great gameplay. A must buy
Story drags out too long, the gameplay is pretty dodgy and is just overall average, and isn't the best GTA game to date.
One of the best FPS games ever made
This game was too short, not enough scares that FEAR 1 was renowned for, and the story didn't have enough to get my attention.
BUY THIS GAME!
Accidentally missed the end quick time event.... and got a bad ending.
Forgot the controls to the game and kicked a priest in the face in a confession booth. 10/10
R9 380, i5 2500k and I'm running this game pretty well on high, with some settings put at medium. Apart from small frame dips when in large areas, this game runs like an absolute charm for me, no crashes no nuffin! This game definitely feels like it has much more depth to it compared to its predecessor, and in its current form is well worth the buy IMO.Although I don't know what's up with this microtransaction B.S., it's highly unnecessary.
Super responsive game where you can only blame yourself for your mistakes, and you'll make a lot of them.
