Played this on PSP. Hell, I loved it.I even tried to play the Japanese sequel the best I could.Here it is, though, the fantastic Steam release. I'm using the Japanese voice acting, still don't like the translation from Super High School Level / Super Duper High School titles to Ultimate titles, since those were so silly and cool like that.Ah well. Still rad, if you haven't seen/heard of it yet, and you like Phoenix Wright-esque games, this is for you.
This game is rad but my friends don't like me wrecking face.Please get the game, nobody wants to play with me.I had someone roll a 1/4 chance of killing themselves and they killed themselves 4 times in a row.Santa rabbit, stars get.
