As i wasnt even able to get into a match due to the incomprehensible menus and redicolous lobby system for matches, my review is only based on the short time i could tolerate this mess of a game.Dont wate your time even downloading this game, its extremley out dated and there are far better free to play games that do everything this game tries to do but better, the text is microscopic, the resolution dosent seem to change at all when you can even find the options menu and there dosent seem to be a quit option anywhere.This game might be ok if it was a Mobile game but not as anything else.
