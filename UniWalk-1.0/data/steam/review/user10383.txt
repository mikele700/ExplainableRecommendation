game get boring realy fast their is not alot of replay ability in this game and their is no australian servers. The game is free and can keep you entitained for about 30-60mins or so
I like the game but its still a little buggy like you can get stuck in objects and cant move and when some one can shot half a clip at you and on your screen its like they shot one bullet then you watch the replay and its commpletely diffrent. when you shot some one with just about a full clip and you die to them and you watch the replay and you dednt even shot. But when the game works its quite fun to play. Thats why i cant recommened the current version of the game.
