Amazing Nordic-themed artwork and music. Tougher bosses than I originally imagined, which made it far more refreshing, nearly as if Dark Souls had been incorporated into a kid's Viking adventure gane. On the whole it's a great game, but the combat style could be a turn-off for those who aren't willing to use one battleaxe and one fighting mechanic the entire game.Definitely would recommend. The price tag attached to the game is rather reasonable for a game that would probably last 4 to 6 hours depending on your playstyle. If you love Norse lore, this game is for you.
