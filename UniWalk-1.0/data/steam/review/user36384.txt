Almost 200 hours on this game and loved it..... until the -update- which was supposed to be beneficial made this game unplayable. Can-'t run it for more than a minute without it crashing. Tried to re-instal, clear caches, everything possible to get in running again. Real shame how they ruined this amazing game.
