Please, if you-'re considering getting this game because it looks like your thing, try not to be too put out by the bad reviews as there is alot of fun to be had so long as you-'re playing with friends.I feel as through the game is as complete as it needs to be in order to have fun online, with friends. The perks are basically 8 unique play styles which become more rewarding as you progress and I agree with the community that some of the perks are not well implemented.I remember the origional horribly buggy Unreal Tournament 2004 mod which is launched with a .bat file and Tripwire have turned it into a very nice looking, atmospheric game with nice mechanics. The weapons are fun to handle and the 200fps animations for them make the slo-mo -zed time- visuals look epic.The micro-transactions are pretty similar to CS:GO, only there if you care with no effect on gameplay.Sometimes a perk has in the past had fairly dissapointing bonuses, and Tripwire have been VERY slow in recognising the flaws and finding alternative bonuses which make the perk more viable.If you live in Australia like I do, there are not many servers since there are no ad spaces so companies have no incentive to host them over here but there are definately enough to get by.TL, DR: I have fun playing this and I wish the community was bigger, especially in Australia because despite tripwire they should eventually get it right
