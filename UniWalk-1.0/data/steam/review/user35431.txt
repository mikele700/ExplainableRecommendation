Has to be one of the greatest game in my library, for anyone that enjoys having lots of $$$ and spending it on guns and then using the guns to get more money to get more guns, this is your game.
 The start was a little bit slow but about an hour into the game it just sucks you in! Loved playing it and will be getting the next Tomb Raider for sure. I would get everyone to play this game if I could just because I think its got a little bit for everyone. I fur sure recommend this game to anyone with a proper brain :)
Great
I would recommend this game-But.... There is always a but..My friends and I struggle so much just having a multipler server between us, it should be easy and quick not taking an hour and rage quitting because it not worth it anymore.Games should be quick to join, my friends and I have only successfully had a multiplayer experience one.Thanks and would much like if some could help out on the servers and try and figure out why we are struggling so much!!!
Amazing!! Cant stop playing after you start, keeps bringing you back.
