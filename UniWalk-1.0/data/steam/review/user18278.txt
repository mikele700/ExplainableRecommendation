This game is amazing you have got to buy it. I know what your thinking oh 30 bucks then on sale for 5 dollars, probably a crappy game but on sale or not it's worth your money. Now if you hate portal 2? Don't go die in a hole. Go die in an endless loop portal. (portal on roof and one staight below it)
