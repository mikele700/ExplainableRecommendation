great game!watch gameplay before buying as it isnt for everyone. the trailer thing on the store page shows some of the features actually in it most of it is what they plan to add.multiplayer is a mixed bucket it can be fun but it can also be really annoying. such as when my base was blown up by a guy with a rocket launcher........overall i recomend it. i have played alot and im not bored.
