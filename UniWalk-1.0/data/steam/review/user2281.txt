Unmodded, I definitely prefer previous TES titles to Skyrim. It lacks a certain something that kept me coming back to Oblivion time and time again. However, with the modded community in full swing these days, you add some amazing stuff to Skyrim to make it the best RPG out there by a long shot. Definitely recommend.
