Even in alpha and sandbox only, this is a fantastic game! Survival horror in a bleak but beautiful setting which is both relaxing and tense. The character need management is reminiscent of The Sims or This War of Mine - always trading off one factor for another. Even harvasting meat from a carcass requires a trade off with time and lowering body temperature.It is fun to plan your next exploration on the trail, slowly gathering the required food, water and fuel over a couple of days and then waiting for a break in the weather to go.When exploring, the maps are well particarly well designed, requiring a balance of both risk and caution to find those far-flung cabins. Many a time you roll into camp almost hypothermic, completely exhausted and in quickly fading dusk light.The player experience across time is rewarding. You go from being afraid of your environment and a complete survival noob to eventually feeling like you're some hardcore Canadian survivalist, stalking the wildlife in your hide clothing.Big thumbs up.
