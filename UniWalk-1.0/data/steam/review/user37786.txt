Very different. If you read too much about this game, you'll spoil it. If you think you've spoiled it, buy it now (if it's on sale), and play it later.
This game has been faithfully updated whilst keeping its charm. The first time through may take you may hours, but it's rewarding if you figure it out yourself. Once through, there's little to return to, but I think I'll be coming back after a year to do it all again. OSX version worked perfectly, except the bonus conent doesn't work, and the achievements were a bit sketchy to register.
This is a very unique experience, that's over too soon. Within 3 hours, I'd completed most of what this game/narrative has to offer, but it was definately the most entertained I've been in a game for a long time. I do hope more content is added, but in the mean time, I'll be trying to solve some of the little mysteries left behind.
Never played before, and I'm actually learning. You have to fight through the frustration, and just keep practicing, but slowly I'm getting somewhere.
The planning man's game. Awesome.
