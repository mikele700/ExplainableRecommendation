This an excellent game, all the elements from the previous game have combined into the final entry, the story is engaging, the world is expansive, the batmobile is alright and a returning character takes the limelight as one of the most enjoyable parts of this game. Do not worry about not playing the DLC, because if you feel like you are missing something, don't the base game is beyond the need of additional content.Is this a game you should play, most definitely, without a doubt, a great ending to a marvellous trilogy, but don't jump in it yet maybe replay AA or AC, and hold off for a few weeks or even later when the GOTY edition comes out, aslong as you play this game. I played this on a Overclocked Pentium G3258 and a 750 Ti, on default settingsStable FPS ranged from: 40 around the city, 35 outside in the batmobile, and 50 for indoorsOccassional FPS drops happened every so often, but not linked to factor in particular
