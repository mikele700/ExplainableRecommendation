It's like Binding of Isaac, but you're rich, own a mansion, but everthing still wants to kill you. But hey atleast you have a mansion.
Not as good as Mount and blade warband, but still a fun game
I was planning on going to a hospital to get some medical supplies for my friends who were sick.I brought some acohol and other little possesions I had for the medicine.Before I left I grabbed a knife,because you never know what could happen.At the door I saw people running in terror, and as they ran people were shooting them down.I quickly ran as well, but I was shot down in moments.Soon Katia died of the flu and Palve was shot to death trying to avange me.GOOD GAME10/10
Fantastic game, definetly get this game.
