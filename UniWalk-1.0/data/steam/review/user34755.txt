Officially the best game ever. I just killed everyone with: Morning Wood, My Little Pony, The Milkman and Your Mom (and there's going to be a whole lot more where that came from)
I love it. Classic graphics and easy controls (once you get used to them) with the edge of survival in everpresent danger. I have a place in my heart for these types of games (not zombie games, classic survival games) and I hope more are made.
