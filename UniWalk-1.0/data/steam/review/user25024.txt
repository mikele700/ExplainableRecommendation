I cannot say enough about this game. I clocked up 12 hours on day one, with an addicting storyline, an easy to achieve framerate @ 60fps 1080p, and amazing character development this game brings everything that us PC players wanted, and more. GTA IV was a disappointment, and I can happily say that GTA V has fixed every issue and raised the level of love I have for gaming.
I seriously cannot get over how fun this game was. The story is a little.... eeeh, but JC3 isn't really about the story. It's about explosions and action. It was fairly buggy on launch but the large majority of these bugs have been fixed,Highly recommended :D

It's certainly.. interesting. A solid game I won't deny, but.. interesting. At first, you feel nothing but you gradually develop this.. sorrow for your character. I've probably already said too much. It's 50 something megabytes and free, so just go play it.
I've played this game for 1.1 hours, and it was filled with hackers, cheaters and other morons who do not know how to play, so instead they give themselves some assistance. The optimisation was okay but needed some serious work. Better cheat detection and optimisation, and I might come back to this later.
With a Cartoony Art Style and brilliant community (98.2% amazing) this game is a generally great game, both competitively and casually.
