Quite fun.The PvE gametype is a refresher from the traditional PvP multiplayer FPS, and it's not P2W at ALL.Just remember, jump when you see those orange circles on the ground radiaing out towards you.
I've played this game since it's Alpha stage of development, and I can safely say that this game is awesome. Fast-paced, frantic action, team-based gameplay, lots of player progression/ metagaming, plus MECHS. What more could one want?However, a word of advice for potential gamers in Oceania. Ever since the Raider Update of 2013, Meteor decided to shut down most of the servers in Oceania, so now, there's [literally] only 4 servers left... and 90% of the time, they're empty. So in order to play, you may have to look at another region (Say, US West) and have to face high latency.
The only game were you can kill people with overly flambouyant and ridiculous weapons that have been wrapped in blinking christmas lights.
