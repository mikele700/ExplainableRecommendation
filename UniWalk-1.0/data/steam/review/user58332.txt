Nice game - when first entered the game I played about 2 hours nothing unusual except it was from 10 to 12pm and woke up at 6 am. What I regret that I didnt recorded, and had to start over :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ter5bqE3epg+ immersive - you feel you are there (over the last 10 years I felt that for a few games only)+ very intuitive+ not that many bugs, I mean there are released games with this polishing- addictive
the frog is cute, swiming is fine, they do say -They Breathe is a short journey- but this is too short, maybe they-'ll do a DLC -FREE.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=babEupaPpjo+ nice, fun and unique like every game should be same as the golden age of games the -'90-too short !!! do more with that lovely frog - a side-scrolling 2D
