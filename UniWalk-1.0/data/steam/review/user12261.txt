Having put in over 100 hours now, I can safely say that this game is definitely worth the $15 it is advertised at. It's like Smash, yes, but more like Melee made easy. The controls are fantastic, and the characters and meta are constantly evolving, and if you're willing to put in the time, you can make any character you want the best.That being said, this game is engineered for competitive play, and thus if you live in a region with no weeklies or monthlies and have a poor internet connection, you'll have a hard time finding people to play.If you're into Melee / Smash in general, give this a go, and I can gaurantee you will have a good time
