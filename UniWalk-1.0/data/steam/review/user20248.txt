Stardew Valley is one of my most favourite games of 2016 with no doubt in my mind.The game starts nice and easy, then slowly throws you into the deep end of weird with mythical creatures, monsters, and all sorts of magic.I bought this game only a small while ago, and have not been able to stop playing it.10 / 10 would definitely recommend to everyone.WARNING - You won't be able to stop playing it.
amazing game, didnt play it on xbox but saw gameplay of it, loved it, I was in the Beta, and got to play it, omg this game is amazing, you should definately buy it 10/10
