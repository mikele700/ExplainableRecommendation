This has potential to be a good game. At the moment it is boring and repeatitive after a few hours of gameplay. Also the fact that there are 3 different classes all with different gameplay make for a long grind to get better weapons. Good use of vechiles though
I opened the game and pressed tutorial missions and they won't load beacuse the were created in a new version of the game even though I just downloaded it. It runs really badly on my computer with a 970, 16gb ram, 3.5ghz i5 procceser and the graphics look terrrible.
I do not reccomend this game UNLESS you are buying it on sale for less than $10. Good things>customizable clothes and shields>fun gameplay mechanicsBad things>Terrible graphics>You have to buy in game hats with real life money. WTF?? I already i bought the game I don't want to pay for hats>You can buy in game weapons with real money. Unfair advantage>DLC is just a reskinned version of the orginal gameSo this game is not worth the full price. Only buy it if it is on sale.
It's very fun but it takes a little bit to get into it and understand how to play properly.
It's fun but I finished the first island in under and hour and currently there are no more islands :(
