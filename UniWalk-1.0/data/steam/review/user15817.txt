With FO4 right around the bend, revisiting the older games is always a refreshing touch, and it seems that with the E3 demo being shown, multiple FO4 inspired mods have been created. By far the best standalone Fallout game and also the best Fallout game for the modding community. I do have one small problem though, manual installations (mainly ENBs), somebody needs to get to work on new tutorials for installing them, as I managed to find no new ones and had to rely on an older one for installing a recently updated ENB, this resulted in me becoming confused, and then ♥♥♥♥ing up my game and having to re-install it with all its mods (including NVSE). So just a minor note there. But overall, a great game and a must-buy for Fallout fans.10/10 would rate again.
