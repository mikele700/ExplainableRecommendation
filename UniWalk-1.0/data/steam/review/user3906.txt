Far cry 3 again splits away from far cry 2 like far cry 2 did to far cry 1. This time you stuck on a tropical island and your friends have been captured by the -pirates- a gang on bandits trying to overtake the island but will you go the way of the warrior or save your friends. the 3rd game in the series is definetly my favourite i feel like the devs put alot of time trying to make all the missions fun and the environments look good. even doing the little side quests like taking radio towers is different every time to overtake it. This game has definetly more interesting weapons and the ability to upgrade them and add camo-'s. overall no spoilers but this has a great story line and any open world/fps lover should get this game!
simply amazing for a 2004 game the physics and storyline really gets you engaged. I think this is one of valves best game series ever
