New fans may not enjoy this game. I've had the pleasure of growing up with the Xeen, Eye of the beholder and other turn based games. Here you will find updated graphics but this game does miss out on modern boss mechanics. A few of these moments exists in the game but this was a missed opportunity by the developers. Everything else in this game is true to the previous series. You will need to save often and build a balanced party (Tank, DPS, Healer and Mage). I finished 1 play through with Paladin (Tank), Barbarian (DPS), Ranger (DPS/Heal with Regen) and Freemage (Heal/AOE/ Damage mitigation spells).8/10 if scoring for older fans
Old School Turn based RPG. Most fun I've had in a while. The text based story telling did not diminish the gameplay experience like I thought it would.
