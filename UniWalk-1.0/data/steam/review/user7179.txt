Killing Floor is a fun game. It's a game where you can shoot ♥♥♥♥ (zombies) and they die. Killing Floor is especially fun with friends, as they provide company and support in a post apocalyptic environment. There are also 7 perks to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, along with varied gameplay and tactics. The maps and textures in this game are dated, but doesn't ruin the overall experience.
