Great game with tons of content that can be played both in single player and co-op! Definitely worth the price!
Fix your ♥♥♥♥ing game. It is just getting more and more buggy. For example I was playing a competitive game and the VOIP just randomly stops working. So I relog CSGO and then it wont let me reconnect to the match as it comes up with the error, -Matchmaking Failed: Failed to connect to match-.Please Gaben fix your ♥♥♥♥ing game I dont want to deal with this ♥♥♥♥ anymore.
Accurate interpretation of my friend's life in 5 years.
The developers should really consider upgrading to Game Maker Pro.
One of the best mods out there!
Great Game
