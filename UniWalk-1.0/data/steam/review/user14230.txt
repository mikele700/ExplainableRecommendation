Let me be clear, this is not an FPS/RPG game.It is not Ghost in the Shell, but there is an amazing reference to it fairly early on.It is not Neon Genesis Evangelion, but it certainly gives it a run for its money.It is not Warhammer 40k, but it takes a few cues from some its more -noteworthy- elements.It is not Borderlands, nor Quake, nor Unreal Tournament.It is not a cinematic experience that we have come to expect from modern developers.It is very much its own thing, and that thing is amazing.E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is a first person shooter notable for its utterly insane combat choices, mindblowingly insane plot and insanely appropriate mistranslation.The setting is a combination of post-apocolyptic cyberpunk ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, Warhammer 40k, David Lynch movies and heavy religious overtones, all presented in the glory of mistranslated french and corrupted Russian voiceovers.It-'s a grotescque parody of stealth games, with crouched speed bordering on crawling, labyrinthian tunnels that span humungeos maps and lead in nothing but obtuse loops. Incredibly broken stealth mechanics balanced only by the existence of the cloak.This is very much a game about going balls to the wall crazy, jumping 20 meters into a group of people with an damaclues while having an existential crisis and halucinating 20 foot tall cyberdemons.While someone blows up extradimensional horrors and actual 20 foot tall cyberdemons with a completely inaccurate but amazingly robust mini-gun.At the same time as another person mows down hundreds of hundreds of space terrorists with an insanely high rate-of-fire submachinegun while abusing hilarious autotargeting implants with maximum efficiancy.Entirely in glorius 32 player co-op.E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy can only be described as an accidental surrealist genocide simulator that righteously ♥♥♥♥♥ all over whatever gaming convention happens to deter from its appointed duty and firmly cements itself in a niche that very few games manage to do well, if at all.You gain brosouf.My legs are ok.Don-'t download the translation patches they ruin everything.
