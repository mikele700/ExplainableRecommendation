It's a diverse game, you don't have to kill zombles, and likewise you don't even have to fight at all, although the experience is far better if you do. Hunt, fish, scavenge, build. The gameplay is fairly balanced, and the menu is easily used. It plays akin to Minecraft with the same blocky style, yet more animated and with a much smaller world, and death is redily available, just ask a zombles. And its free and receives fairly regular updates? Hell yes this game is amazing. 9.5/10 Rubber chickens, only missing 0.5 due to the fact that the editor is mystifying.
EPICCCCC 10/10
Alien Swarm is an amazing game where you play as space soldiers. Your objective is to save a cononly on a distant planet. the calls magment is very good and the leveling systems if perfect. I give it a 9000/10
