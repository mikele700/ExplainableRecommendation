I would recommend this game for 2 reasons, one: because its fast-paced and two: it has great graphics. Give the game a try.
You know, this is the best thing ever. I'm very happy I bought this.The acheivements were hard, but very fun. Completed some sidejobs EASYILY due to the modifacations.And overall, i give this pack an 8/10, the 10/10 and 9/10 is because it doesn't add in a heist, and music.
Everything in a zombie apocalypse put in to ONE. 10/10, TLW.
Most scariest game since Amnesia: The Dark Descent!
eh.
This game is an astounding breakthrough on modern top-down shooters, even leading on to other games, a custom level workshop for campaigns and single levels, and even figurines. This deserves the 3rd game of the series, Midnight Animal, to be even better than the other 2 games. Hotline Miami 3: Midnight Animal, will probably make a more astounding comeback in the series, even if its not by the real developers.
This is like a kids game, but is ment to be a enormus MMO. 10/10.
