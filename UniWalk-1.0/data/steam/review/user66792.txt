great game way better that borderlands 1 better guns and better game play and better campaign exilent dlc and the dlc classes are just devine the art work is amazing and its just over all fun i got it for $16 but its well  worth $100 but all the dlcs are over priced i think like seriously $15 for a extra class i mean that is redicluas but its is one ov my favourats so i think it desurvs a 10/10 and the extra missons are fun as well its not like go kill this thing or go here and talk to this person its like 3-4 missons long and the work of pandora ajusts to what you do in the campaign and its one of those games that have a long and really i mean really fun campaign an its one of those game what you play in front of a bowl of chips and beer with a whole bunch of mates getting stoned and drunk that is the borderlands 2 life
