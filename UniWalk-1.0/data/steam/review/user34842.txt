Have played this far more than I should. This procrastination has been enabled by friends.Peer-pressure 10/10
Don't let the thumbs-down misguide you, this is a decent game and an encouraging burst of fresh air even among indie titles. But 'Gone Home' just doesn't deserve your $19.99. I finished the base game in a little under two hours and after that there's next to no playability. Get it on sale or don't get it at all.
First time playing any Wolfenstein game. Throughly enjoyed the silky smooth combat and ran quite well on my GTX780ti. Plot left something to be desired but this is a title among a series dating back to where it helped create the FPS genre. So it's kind of irrelevent anyway.Definitely worth a play, 8/10.
This game has won so many awards and I finally know why. After 3 years, CD Projekt RED have created a masterpiece that will stand the test of time and be remembered fondly by gamers years from now. Cannot praise this game highly enough, the sheer content that is thrown in your face can keep you occupied for 200+ hours. Have to say, I got the worst ending possible and it has had such an emotional impact that I immediately want to start a new playthrough. Please do yourself a favour and throw money at this publisher so others follow in their footsteps.9.5/10
