poorly optimized crap,run at 40 fps on gtx 760  4 gb on lowest setting and stutter every 1 second
better than cod ghost
this game is really awesome the realistic gameplay, the graphic ,the classes and the weaponry is really great
the campaign in this game is actually fun,i have to admit the story is actually great,but this game have a lack of performance,i get stutter alot on my gtx 760 which is the recommended graphic card and i have to lower all of the setting to medium/low to make the stutter less noticeable(that doesn't mean the stutter gone) and some host problem,i always get into 800 ping matches and some time i got into a modded lobby and get my rank resetted which is frustating
[Bang her] (for those that have played chpater 4 :P)
this game makes me had a boner
what am i doing with my life.....
I BUY THIS THING FOR ONLY 5 CENT HAHAHAHHAHAHHA
