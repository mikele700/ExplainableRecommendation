Very addicting. Played alot lately and I'm not stopping there. Definitely a must-try game.
I would like start off by saying, I-'m sorry that I pirated this game in the beginning. I was unappreciative back then. Now on to review. I found out about this game when I was looking through torrents for games to play while I was over at my grandparents-' home because over there, there-'s no internet. I stumbled across Bioshock Infinite. Now, I would like to state that I-'ve never really heard of this game before. I decided I might get a few hours of this game. I found myself completely immersed into the world this game presented to me. I felt like I was the main protagonist and blocked out everything around me. Every feeling he felt, I felt. Everything he said, I muttered. Everything he did, I followed. I finished the game, and wasn-'t pleased with it. So, I decided to buy it. The story was amazing. It worked perfectly with the atmosphere. The characters was a huge asset in the story, each with their own unique characteristics and how their personality complimented each other. The gameplay is alittle bit iffy at some points, but overall it-'s great. The enemies are also different from each other, meaning you have to strategically defeat them. Some are your normal -'I-'m gonna shot you in the face-' and some are -'To defeat me, you-'re gonna have to do vigor combos and plant crits on me-'.  Graphics are just.... just MAGNIFIQUE! The amount of detail that goes to everything is just breath-taking. EVEN TRASH LOOKS NICE. The characters fit in every cutscene and basically, everywhere you go. Nothing seems out of place, not even the things that ARE out of place. Lighting is just right, not too much, not too little. I-'m no artist, but this game is just a beauty to look at. It-'s like heaven on earth. (Yes, that-'s a game referrence) This game towers absolutely EVERYTHING when it comes to voice-acting. Are they voice-acting or were they just secretly voice-taped during their daily life? Because, I-'ve never heard so much emotion. Trust me, you will never go -That doesn-'t right. He-'s frustrated but why is he talking like he-'s laughing?-. I would like to personally see each individual voice actor and give them gifts, just to congratulate them. DLCs are abit lacking but for what it-'s worth, I-'d recommend you getting them, every single one. Burial At Sea explains the aftermatch of the game and will give you abit of nostalgia if you-'ve ever played Bioshock 1 and/or 2. Overall, amazing game. It is my favourite game of all time, that is, until another one takes it place, but that-'ll be awhile. The only thing I would like to complain about it, is the eyes. Some cutscenes make Elizabeth-'s eyes so wide, like they-'re gonna pop-out. I definitely recommened buying this game.(You may experience what I call -Bio-depression- after you finish the game. Totally normal, don-'t fear. Just... wait it out.)_______________________________________________________________For the TL;DR people,Great game. Buy it.
I'm having mixed feelings.
Don't worry, there's no rain, so it's not all that risky. There are giant monsters, like A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ JELLYFISH! That... shoots balls at you. Hm, not that pleasant of an adventure, is it now?BUT TO HELL WITH IT!Get this game and have fun. c:
Amazing game. Worth every cent.A simple, yet fantastic game.Death is a common thing in this game so don't expect to beat it on your first try. You unlock new races, hats and companions as you progress through the game. Lots of biomes, monsters, items, and much more. Skills are a thing too, you can either build a pure skill tree or you can mix it up abit here and there.
