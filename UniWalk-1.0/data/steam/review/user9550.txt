At first, I was so damn hesitate with all the negative reviews that took me 2 days to finally buy the game (I was originally intended to buy on the Day 1). So, I went to watch streams for an hour on Youtube, and man, it looks so good I have to buy it for myself.I did not regret that decision at all. This game gets so much better with friends.It's not kind of FPS like COD or BF4, and the enemy is not kind of that much spongey when you play in the right level.Man, don't waste your time reading all those negative reviews. Try it for yourself.If you don't like it, you still can request Steam for the refund.
