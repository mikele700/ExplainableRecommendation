I really like this game. Despite people not liking the -futuristic ♥♥♥♥- I like it. The one thing I hate about this is the optimization or lack thereof. Sometimes i get 90fps on medium settings 70% 1080p. Sometimes I get 30 fps on 1080p at LOW settings. FFS Treyarch get your ♥♥♥♥ together. ♥♥♥♥ you treyarch for making consoles looks good on this game.
Definitely a great game, props to Nelson for such great implementation and among other things hardwork, however servers are needing some sort of remake or official ones as most just suck. Not a lot Nelson can do about this though except implement official servers, this however would obviously intrude on a FTP model. One of the best things about this game is the weekly updates being churned out by one man. Looking to buy the $5 upgrade.
Great Game 10/10
Loved it 10/10:) - Gameplay is Great, Fun and ExtensiveGraphics aren't top notch but pretty good :( - Not worth $10 it should be $2.49When you die you shouldn't have to go back to the start
I love this game. The graphics aren't perfect and the game play isn't flawless but the storyline is original and even though I feel like raging when I fall in a smallest patch of spikes its still pretty damn good!
