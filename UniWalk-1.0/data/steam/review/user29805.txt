Normally i post a positive review because i am always a giddy, joyful natured person, but with a game like this... NO. For starters the devs probably know this game is crap because all they gave us for the game was 3D model in desc no gameplay. I have seen so many people request things but the devs couldn't care less. The camera is bad, infantry and sometimes vehicles just go through walls. And out of all the time i have played it just doesn't have that, FUN feel. I highly recommend you do NOT buy the game. The only reason you should buy it (if you are crazy enough) is because it is the only quarter-decent military RTS out there.
This game is a great laid back indie game. It is fun and all it starts off easy peasy and then it gets really Really REALLY! Ragy. But i still enjoy every minute of it. Except IT CRASHES ALOT BEWARE! Well for me it does, aaanyway. When i was just about to click the centre of the galaxy the game CRASHED!! WHICH IS DEFINITELY NOT GOOD!! ANDDD T T T T IT DOESN'T SAVE!! But i calmed myself, I see peacock dreams becoming a big thing one day and hopefully the GAME STOPS CRASHING!! But apart from CRASHING!! Alot i would definitely recommend it because for some reason the game ONLY CRASHES FOR ME!! And is definitely great, great, great, great for the price.7/10Btw the game just updated no crashing anymore :)9.5/10
This game i would definitely recommend. i especially liked the new gameplay of destroying enemies and adding their parts to your tech to make it bigger then fight bigger enemies to get even bigger and so on. This it is a definite must buy to any type of gamer (9/10)
