POSTAL 2 is possibly one of the most funny/weird/f*cked up games we have ever seen. Really who cares about graphics if it's fun to play? That is what I think about this game. The story is very amusing but a bit confusing WHY U WOULD HAVE SO MUCH TROUBLE DOING A WEEK'S WORTH OF ERRANDS?This game is hilarious, fun and a bit difficult really. Your always getting caught up in stuff instead of doing what your supposed to do like GTA.Now the best part of this game is definetely-PEEING! Who can go this whole game without peeing once?Anyway I should wrap this up. POSTAL 2 is an amazingly fun game with f*cked up stuff just waiting to happen. You could be stuck in a battle with the police, laughing your head off or escaping from prison. This is basically an FPS version of GTA so it is very fun and amusing.I give POSTAL 2 a 9/10
Ace Of Spades is a bit like minecraft but with guns. There is no crafting or mobs to fight though. Not that this makes it a worse game though. There are heaps of cool gamemodes like infection or zombie, CTF, Demolition and my favourite VIP. Ace Of Spades is a wonderful blocky FPS that takes about 1 and a half months to master. I would give it a 7/10
This is one of the most outstanding games in the shooter genre. Creeping past enemy lines and destroying peoples faces with snipers has ever been so satisfying. The only downside is that there are only 20 levels but at least theres an amazing story right? There are also many parts to them so that is pretty cool.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes shooters and stealth games. I actually recommend the whole series.If I had to give this a rating it wwould be 8.5 out of 10
Probably the best CS game yet. Yeah Source was good but this is next level stuff. The graphics are good, the maps are good, the voice acting is good and the custom weapons are sick. Probably one of the best FPSs ever.
