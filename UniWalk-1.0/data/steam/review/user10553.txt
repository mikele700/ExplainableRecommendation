Definitely one of the most unique and engaging FPS games that I-'ve played. The wild west theme is refreshing, especially with the animation for the guns and the reloads. Atmosphere isn-'t the same sort of -dry desert-theme that you might expect. One minute your in the mountains and forests and the next you-'re ona moving train facing down gatlling guns. Not the greatest FPS player but even on Normal difficulty the game was challenging. Story line is interesting and you get to face down a lot of the old legends. Visuals were really good. Very worth the price but definitely a must buy if it-'s on sale.
Great looking game, with stunning visuals. Gameplay was fun, with the option to choose between a 'run and gun' terminator style of blasting through obstacles or using the environment and lighting to your advantage and opt for the more stealthy approach. Realistic limitation on number of weapons/ammo/items that can be carried, but not overly realistic so as to limit the enjoyability of the game. You get the feeling that you really are living in a sort of desolate post apocalyptic wasteland which give the game a great immersive feel. Storyline is good and the voice acting is note worthy. If I had a complaint with the game, it would only be that the story felt a bit short. For any fan of FPSs this is a must have.
Nothing but silly fun. Add to that some ridiculous hats and gear and you're guaranteed to have a blast. Plus it's one of the few F2P games where in-game purchases are not necessary to play past a certain point.
