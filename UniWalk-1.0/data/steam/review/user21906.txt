10/10 would die by landing gear again!
One of the best game's on steam i don't see the comparisons to minecraft thou because minecraft and terraria are extremely different. Terraria is a 2D dungeon crawler light rpg game it is worth the price tag.
This game is great with friends enjoying alot of my time with it the only problem is that on biotics lab i can get stuck on a plant but other then then a great game.
DAYZ is a great game with friends but be warned you may lose you save you have be warned.
Awesome must get great silly multi player.
