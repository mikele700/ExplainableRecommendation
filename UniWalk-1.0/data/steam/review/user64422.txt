Team mates are either pros or useless all about luck of what team you get put with
Awesome for a F2P, the gameplay is thrilling, the graphics are good no matter what setting you have it on and they are always updating it which means the admins actually try which I find very rare for F2P.
The only thing that ruined this game was that after you buy an item you get a certain amount of time with it.
Great graphics for it's age and very fun and long gameplay. Had a bit of a problem with Windows Live at the start but got it fixed. One of my favouritegames of all time.
4 years since the game came out and still discovering new places.10/10
good and fun but it says there is multiplayer but its not wat I expected I was hoping for servers with like 25 players in them not just lan. Still a good game tho
This game is so fun and intresting.
Good for a free to play not a pay to win type of game for once. Only problem tho is there is like a 11.7gb update which takes a while but after the update its totally worth the wait.
