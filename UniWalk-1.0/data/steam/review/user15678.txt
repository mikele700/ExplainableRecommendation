I got this game almost a year back, it used to be amazing and used to have potential, but now its bloody P2W
Just a short review.Survarium is a post apocolyptic game were 2 teams battle on multiple mapsI dont really understand how these people think you cant find battles I have found them very easily6.5/10 -ign
This game is terrible unless you like losing your gear 99.9 % of the time thanks to stupid bugs.
Amazing open world mixed with  amazing graphics, a TRUE addition to The TES (The Elder Scrolls) franchise 9.5/10.      (anythings better than the upcoming elder scrolls online) =P
fun,yet almost impossible to kill someone
A very realistic game for hardcore fpsers. NOTE: you will need a good pc to run it
Amazing game,challenging but super fun
GR8 B8 M8 LOTS OF MOONEY$ TO BE $PENT M8TY 420/1337 PRETTY DANK HELMETS GOTY
I don't get why everybody is hating on it, its an amazing game with cool suits and awesome web slinging
