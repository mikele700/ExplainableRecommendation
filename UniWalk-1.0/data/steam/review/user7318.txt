Not a very gameplay heavy game but the story and the choice based system more than make up for it. If you haven't played it yet, get on it.
Awesomeness to the max!!!
Immensely smooth combat, it looks beautiful. I haven't managed to play onlint properly yet but it's definitely the best sword fighter game out.
cool
A lot like The Walking Dead video game which is definitely a good thing. The First Episode is the only one available at this point in time but the story so far is incredible. If you like The Walking Dead play this, no questions asked.
Incredible Gameplay. Beautiful Visuals. Creative Storyline. This game is pure awesomeness.
Awesome. Just Awesome
Crazy wacky DLCs and quite good game-play
