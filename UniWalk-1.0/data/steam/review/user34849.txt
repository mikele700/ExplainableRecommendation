The game is good the graphics are amazing but the servers of this game is really sucking ,I've been waiting to play a game for 20 minutes and sometimes you finally find a server people may just leave the lobby or the killer just won't be ready .Overall this game is averge , if only the server are fixed or upgrade to a higher qualtiy it would definitily be a good game
WTF i payed so much money for this bloody game and now you tell me is free???Are you kidding me
i think this is a good game but can you guys add a assain class plz.i think this game's vehicles are very nice but i think the flying vehicles's controll is a little bit hard to master.
