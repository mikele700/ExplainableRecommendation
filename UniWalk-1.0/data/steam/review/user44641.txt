This game is awesome, you must get it.  You can build a 3D space ship and fly it around and smash stuff up with it.  The colision engine is great and so is the whole game. Just imagine what the multiplayer would be like.  Mayhem.  You mine asterioids to obtain the ores you need to build or just use creative mode to build to your hearts content
