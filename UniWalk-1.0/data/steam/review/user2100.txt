I've really enjoyed this game, the grinding for XP gets tedious after level 86 but its fun! I wish we had more DLC's though, like characters from Dragonball Super (Champa, Vados etc.) instead of having modders add them into the game.
First of all, the combat in this game is awesome. It has a great artstyle, the game is easy enough to pick up, and its fun over all. I've definitely had my share of fun with this game and on special, its definitely a steal. Only complaint that I do have is that the camera controls can sometimes be clumsy.
I only bought this game for zombies to be honest, with custom zombies coming out this game will stay alive for years in terms of replayability value. If you're a huge fan of zombies like myself, then buy this for the custom zombies, trust me, its worth your money.
I love it. With every attempt I learned more about the map itself and I got further and further. It's a great experience.
Feels. Extreme Michonne feels. 9/10.
I dislike the fact that this game doesn't even support mouse controls, which should be a must in this day and age, especially with games like this, where its fast paced. I tried using a controller which the game wouldn't even recognize so I couldn't even play it. At least the refund button worked.
