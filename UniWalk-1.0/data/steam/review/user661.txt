I played the first, completed to 100%, found it enjoyable, It's a point and click adventure game, I had no problem picking up the second, didn't hesitate at all, The second is just as fun, lots more reading, lots of random clicking to find things, The only problem, It's super grindy, It's like you need to grind everything to just pass one spot every time, whether it be fishing, picking herbs etc,There aren't too many quests near the beginning, so you basically need to complete them all to have enough fame to continue, I found this some what repetitive and unenjoyable, I was constantly going from place to place to get more and more items for one quest because It has the last bit of fame I need to progress through to the next stage.I played the first one without stopping, I couldn't, It was too much fun, the second however, I've taken several breaks, there's only so much grinding a person can do before it's tiresom and you just don't want to do it anymore, I found the need to complete things to unlock mushroom, eggs etc quite bad, usually you'd just click and it's unlocked, not having to do quests etc to get that ability. Overall, still a decent game and I'd play it over quite a few times, If there were more additions, I would not hesitate to grab, one of my favorite point and click games.
- EARLY ACCESS REVIEW - ( Note, When I play this more (which I will), this review will change.I understand this is early access and has been for quite some time, I also understand bugs/glitches are always going to be there.I-'ve been there the whole way through the greenlight, and I was so excited I could actually play it via steam.I-'m deeply inlove with harvest moon, always have been, always will be, this is based off harvest moon, therefor i-'m expecting it to be something quite like it.Overall, it has great potential, and when/if it comes out for 3DS/WiiU/Psvita, I-'ll also be grabbing it on thus consoles i have. I know a lot of work has gone into this game, and a lot more hours will be spent making it the greatest it can be.Pro-'s- Closest thing to Harvest Moon itself.- Love the details/graphics- Calming Tunes ( May get annoying after awhile )- Easy to waste a year of your life away- Early Access, ( room for improvement )- Somewhat playable- Playable via Steam- Fast and easy start up- many, many more, and I-'m sure i-'ll have more to add when I-'ve played more hours.Cons; Annoying Features/bugs/Glitches I noticed. (JUST BECAUSE THERE-'S MORE CONS THAN PRO-'S, DOESN-'T MEAN IT-'S A BAD GAME)- Spelling Mistakes, such as, On the sign at the farm, -'ax-'. -they-'re reactions are similar-, The mayor says -'they-'s instead of they-'d -- overused words( Dear,Gotcha,Getcha ) makes it seem unprofessional when it-'s there twice a sentence,- not too detailed about the actual things you need to know- walking through doors sideways and not where the door is.( On the mayors tour )- mayor disappears in the General Shop when first meeting- mistaken he/she at the farm when clearly accepted was a she.. and then says she in the next sentence.- -they-'re reactions are similar-- random 0 when mayor talks about the animal attacks at the start- few music tunes from harvest moon(friends of mineral town+TreeOfTranquility). - First person to visit the farm repeats before roselyn/jessica shows back up- Massive random line of b when jessica shows the above view of town- sleep and save is glitched, Can-'t save, - can-'t sleep ( option comes up, is accepted and then nothing happens )- start is an hour long-  No sound effects ( tools, people, walking etc )- Farm Layout Is basically EXACTLY like Harvest moon ( No Originality )- Turnip Seeds glitching and becoming infinite at the start- Controls are bugged and seem to not work ( Interact Button, even when changed. Also Escape for back comes up with exit option, everytime. )
As far as card games go, everyone knows they aren't as good as getting together with a few friends and dueling like the good old days, I've struggled to find a decent game that covers everything and Is absolutely fun to play, I must admit, getting the hang of It and learning which Is good and which isn't, does take some time, then again so does learning to ride a bike.This takes the top of the list for Pc card games, Also FTP, so It's definitely worth a look.:)
10/10 would uninstall again and again, and again.Comp = Smurfville with a side of epic trolling.Win 20 games > Rank up > Lose ONE game > Deranked Instantly.Get a bad team you-'re done don-'t bother just uninstall it isn-'t worth it.No Mic = No communication = Lol where-'re we going each round = Slaughtered.Epic trolls = Oh look just defuse, lolnope | Oh what? that-'s an enemy, oh my bad.|De Rankers > People that can-'t be bothered playing a fair game of their skill level, so they de-rank and take people with them because they simply want to be able to slaughter people and have their team say - OMG you aced this! you-'re beast as!-It-'s honestly getting worse and worse daily. Goodluck getting through SEM>GN4  9-10 games will be trolling, griefing, de-ranking llama faces.Casual:Casual is exactly what it sounds like, all the nice chill games where you don-'t have to worry about a rank or how good of a team you might have, no casual is a bunch of music spamming not caring casual players that just mess around because well who plays seriously in casual.And then there-'s all these cute little mini game sort of things, DeathMatch etc.Deathmatch is great for improving your recoil control and how fast you actually notice said enemy and shoot.I-'ve heard countless Keyboards, Desks, Computers and Headsets broken over the fact people rage so much.10/10 Addictive as hell.
- RECENT REVIEW -New engine, completely rebuilt, lots of updates, It's a pretty decent game again, although, having a beast computer is the only way to see the new engine at its best, It's too overwhelming on my computer, and i'm having trouble playing it with all my settings either off or extremely low.Its got lots of new additions, such as a completely new map, which is absolutely massive, and if you die without a sleeping bag placed, chances are you aren't going to find your spot again anytime soon if ever, horses, they're quite cool, and the deer, the animals are just completely awesome, except for the wolves, they could be downgraded, they run way too fast and glitch all over the place.all different types of building, wood, stone, sheet metal, reinforced, locks, cupboards, There's so many new features and additions, it's all had a makeover and is pretty.. hahaI guess it's a decent game again, depending on the server you play on, I won't be playing it as much as i used to, but it's a nice treat every now and then :)- EARLY ACCESS REVIEW -I stopped playing a fair bit after zombies were removed and replaced with mutant bears and wolves, It just wasn't as much fun, I enjoyed finding an amazing server with a decent community, running around the map on resource runs and seeing who could headshot a zombie first, Zombies really were the highlight of this game for me, after that was removed, everything went bad, there were no decent servers, there were hackers, less updates, found myself and a friend just throwing flares down a hill and watching it roll, for about 3 hours, and that was all we did. Thus, Rust had nothing more to offer for me and I completely stopped playing it.- EARLY EARLY ACCESS REVIEW -Rust well.. It's different.It may be in Alpha but it's already such a great game, I'm excited and dreading new updates, I love the way it is at the moment, not knowing if the upcoming developments will ruin what i think or make it even better, going to have to wait and find out, I spend most of my time playing this game, Surely enough playing on a populated server isn't a good idea, it'll ruin your experience all together, the key is to find a decent server with only about 20-40 people online, i'd say start off with a pve until you get the hang of things. Also playing on Official servers aren't exactly the best idea.Wolves and bears have a fair amount of health compared to the zombies, bears and wolves you have to avoid until you have a bow or a gun, zombies you can take on with a pickaxe etc. This is a great game and definitely worth the money, considering it's in Alpha, it's damn well good.I thought it'd be one of those games that look great but turn out pretty bad, Looks great, is great.The only downer for me is the fact it over heats my laptop, and that's when I play with Render Quality 0, and run it on the fastest option. The graphics are great.. but I can't really play with them. I have a decent gaming laptop.. but still It overheats so I have to take breaks and I don't like that.All in all, Great game, definitely worth a look at :)I'm sure more people would buy it if there was a demo, then again it's in alpha and only $20, Still worth a look :)I surely don't regret this game and I won't anytime soon =D
Tomb Raider is amazing, It's my favourite game by far. Has been for months and will continue to be, I'm hoping there's a part 2, or a completely new game, the graphics are amazing, vocals are awesome, missions, hidden artifacts, tombs, wolves, good guys, bad guys, and that's just the campaign, I played for 13 hours, 6 and a half hours for 2 days, I couldn't stop. It's like finding a good book and not putting It down.buying this on sale would be a massive rip off, It's worth full price and so much more. People say nothing's perfect because there's always room for improvment, Tomb Raider just goes to show, Perfect does exist. Best.Game.Ever.
Another great game I can't stop playing, It's a multiple reminder of a bunch of games thrown together into one.I'm glad It's FTP, but I certainly would pay for It.Seems as It is FTP, there should be no reason for people to not check It out.It's definitely one of my top 10.
