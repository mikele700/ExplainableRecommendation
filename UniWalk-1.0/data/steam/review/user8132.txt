My playtime was achieved in about 5 days....... steals your life. Best RPG game ever made. Cant find any negatives buy it and the dlc and let you life drain away.
You can beat people to death with a ♥♥♥♥♥... 10/10
By far the best MOBA i have played, dota 1 was the godfather of all MOBA's so you could imagine that this game would be awesome. Good graphics, smooth gameplay, alot of Pinoys playing on the oceana server which is annoying because it limits communication, good selection of hero's with all of them free unlike League of Legends and smite, but some hero's are very overpowered to the point where rage quitting happens.Overall i score this an 9/10
Not worth the money for alpha... reccomended it when full release. Fun but just too many issues. And make sure you ply with nudity on.
One of the best story telling games out there with fun puzzles and likeable characters. Short and sweet, truly a masterpiece of story telling. 9/10 (few bugs made me have to tweak the game).
Insanley fun game if played with friends. Not reccomended if you want to keep your sanity
Amazing story, you feel for characters. Good cartoon graphics. Episodes 4 & 5 coming soon. Definetley a story game, not much game to it. Worth a full price tag with all episodes.
Very fun, addictive, cool cartoon graphics. Has a couple of bugs but game is regularly patched. Definetley worth the download and best of all its FREE!
