Do not buy this game. As of 20 January 2016, NetherRealm Studios has officially ended support for Mortal Kombat X on PC. - No Improved Netcode- No Kombat Pack 2 (Leatherface, Bo'Rai Cho, Triborg, Xenomorph)- No New Stages- No Mortal Kombat XL bundleAnd I was looking forward to this XL bundle, such a waste.
Games for Windows Live is cancer
