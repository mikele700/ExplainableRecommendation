Defiance is a fun shoot-the-bad-guys with the added twist of story linkage with the Tv Series.  I really enjoyed playing it with my partner, and I particularly liked the style of minor/major quest lines.  it was enjoyable and spread the game out so the main quest line didn-'t advance too fast.  However, it unfortunately became monotonous fairly quickly and the lack of any -shiny loot- other than newer guns lost my interest.. I do look forward to those awesome purples etc
