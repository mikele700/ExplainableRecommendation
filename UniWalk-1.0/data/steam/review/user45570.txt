Without this game i whould never of found the epicness that is the pc community.Also F#CKING Amazing game!
I Love the Resident Evil Series! From the old ones to the new ones. I dont care what anyone says the new resi games are awesome! Yes there not like the awesome classics resi 1, 2 and 3 but there still a riot to play! and resi 5 is great fun to play!It took resi 4's gameplay and combat and turned it into a great co-op expirience If your looking for a great action/semi-horror co-op game with a nice story and charaters. Look no further. Also play the classics when you get the chance. Sorry for my bad grammer
