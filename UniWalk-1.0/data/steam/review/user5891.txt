Has to be the best FPS I've ever played, infact it's probably up in my Top 5 games of all time.To start, I'm not a serious hardcore gamer but this got me really addicted and have played over 20 hours in the past week. I mostly play competetive and deathmatch, but there's also other modes such as casual if you don't want to be involved in ranks or waiting for the 20 hour cool down after playing too much competetive.Don't get intimidated by the fact of buying guns and knives, because they are simply just skins and don't give the player that spent $400 on a knife any advantage over the player that spent $0. However the cool thing about steam is being able to sell cards and other items which you can use to purchase weapons or buy crates and keys to have a chance to win better guns and knives.You do get a few hackers and afk players every know n' then but they are easily kicked with the easy team voting system. The main problem I have is smurfs, which are players that make other accounts and may seem as a low rank but actually have a higher rank making them unfair as they play with lower ranks even though they are much more skilled.Finally gamplay, the gameplay is very smooth and well thought out. Low rank players play with low rank players and high rank players play with high rank players. All guns have their advantages and disadvantages such as long range, short range, recoil, damage, fire rate and accuracy. Each map has well placed objects which can be used as cover.Overall this game is a MUST! I reccommend cs:go to any fps gamer or even any average gamer in general.
