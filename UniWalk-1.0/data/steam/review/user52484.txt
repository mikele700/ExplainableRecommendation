I find it way more enjoyable than some of the big budget games like C.O.D and Battlefield.Especially since there arn-'t any 6 years olds screaming how many times the -♥♥♥♥ed- my mum
Heros and Generals is a really good game for anyone that is intersted in the war or fps games.The only downside is that most players will end up joining the Germans side making it a lot harder to find games. Good textures and sound effects, but has a few bugs and kinks but ither than that its a pretty good game.8/10
Do not Buy this game.I repeat do not waste money on this terrible game.Worst game I have ever payed for.Try the demo before paying for this game
Excelent game machanics.Im loving the art style.This is probably one of my favourite games so far.I would recommend this game to anyone that is a fan or survival games and/ or adventure games.9/10
