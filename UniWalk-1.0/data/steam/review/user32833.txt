Pretty gud
The game is ♥♥♥♥, my favourite part was clicking the uninstall button.10/10 would uninstall again
Wheatley is cool 10/10
I have played it for 3 hours non-stop now and i absalutely love this game, and to think this game came out of a 17 year old, WOW! Obviously been a work in progress game there are some bugs but they are not major, the game is still extremely fun, to anyone who might be considering trying out the game, do it, it is addictive. One thing i hope he does put in though is so that when you press Esc the game stops rolling in the background, beacause when you press Esc at the moment the game keeps rolling in the background , making it so when you need to do something e.g eat lunch you  come back and you are dead from starvation or dehydration. i also wish he would put a save button in so when you have to go out you can save your world so you dont have to make your base from scratch again!
I personally do not recommend this game, i do have many friends but none have this game, therefore it is quite boring and the graphics are not great, however i do reccommend guns of icarus online as it is a fantastic online game that never gets boring and you dont need friends to have the game to have fun as there is a whole bunch of people, i greatly recommend you dont get this game and just go straight for the online one.
