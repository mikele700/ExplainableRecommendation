The gameplay alone is amazing.  The entire concept of having to be on board a ship full of murderers including yourself makes this rich, as well as having it very well balanced.  the fact that it adds many variables that you need to keep in check on top of killing adds difficulty and immersion to the game, and there's many opportunities for you to kill people as well as get killed. It's splendid and I'd recommend it if you can play LAN with a couple friends. My only gripe is the fact that there are no more dedicated servers to host multiplayer matches.  I hate this because playing with real people makes it more intense as you need to think who may be a real person or an AI, and it's a lot more fun to kill someone knowing they'll have a reaction.  On top of that; the games AI isn't very smart either.  They'll hardly ever attack you, or sometimes it's easy to know that they're hunting you. Still it's a great game and with how cheap it is with sales it's worth it for the experience.
I-'ve ran into trouble with the animations. For some reason the body animations aren-'t moving, making player models and zeds have a -civilian- look with arms at the side, although they seem to tilt back and forth when moving.  I also can-'t see my left hand in first-person view, and I can see the shotgun shell outside of the shotgun hanging freely.
