This is a GREAT GAME the most realistic zombie game i have ever played... Danger lurking around every corner an array of weapons and materials that you can use in the apocalypse. Not only can you get infected and die but you can get soaked, sick, angry, hot, cold, bored, unhappy, exhausted, tired, hungry, thirsty... Really great game with an EXTREMELY great potential
