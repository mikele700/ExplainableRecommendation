Been wanting to play it for ages but when i get it i found out my amazing gaming pc isnt good enough to handle it. great game but only get it if you have an ultimate computer(Edit) the performance bug has been fixed so there is nothing stopping you from playing now.
Amazing fun for all ages, great mechanics, awesome items and enemys and at moments gut-wrenchingly funny.Would recommend this to anyone.
