This is not not a standard review I would do because it will be a quick little review but I hope this will be helpfull.First of all I personally think that this game is solid and the world design is nothing short of beautiful and the story from what I played so far is pretty good aswel. But from what I read of the other reviews a lot of people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about the -'pay to win-' mechanic they have but to be fair I don-'t see it. They talk about grinding Astral diamonds, yes that is true but the items you get from the store paying with Astral diamonds you could get them by doing quests and the items you get like equipment they are for like level 60-'s so by that time you will have enough to buy the armour or you already have some epic unicorn armour. Another thing is Zen coins, a currency in game where you pay actual money to get or you exchange Astral diamonds, you might think -HAWLY SHEIT that is pay to win right there- just buy all the epics........ no its not like that because if you are willing to spend £24 for 3000 Zen coins that is jsut enough for 1 companion sure go ahead.Anyway lets some it up shall we, this game is amazing, awsome fighting mechanics, beautiful world design, a really good storyline interesting NPCs and outstanding voice acting. Overall you are missing out if you still didn-'t download Neverwinter and its free so what are you waiting.9.1/10
