Unturned is a really fun game and sometimes even show really I mean REALLY funny moments. I recommend trying it. Unlike terraria and Left For Dead 2 it is more like a Sandbox game because you can get really creative and build things like terraria but also go ahead have fun by killing some zombies. To be honest Unturned is still a early development game which makes is more intresting because we will never know what will happen in the future and what it will be like when fully complete. The even better things about this game is that is 2 perspective first person and third person. Recently Unturned just added VR(Virtural Reality) which makes it more fun to get in the experience of what a zombie apoclypse fells like and how you can survive in it.I strongly recommend this game. But I do have a few tips maybe like add a main power place and add more weapons to make the game a bit more relastic such as a AK-47. But the main things I suggest you need to figure out is a story line of how the zombie apoclypse started because the new players wont know how it happend and just get spawned right into the game.
