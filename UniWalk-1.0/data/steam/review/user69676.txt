I only have one thing to say... GOATS! This game is legendary!
I love this game. I originally bought it because it was one of the few single player mac games around. Then I discovered multiplayer when I realised a few of my friends had it. This was more fun than you can imagine. Foolishly running around or being stealthy was fun either way. The fact that you work together instead of against each other (but there is a mode for that to) was awesome because it was never about who got the most coins it was just about getting all the coins. The level design is great and never gets boring, the music suits the game so well, and the characters have equally great abiities. Even in single player this game is great. I've owned it for about half a year and still have not completed all the levels. The storyline is sometimes laughable but always interesting. Imagine Hotline Miami had a child with Payday 2, thats Monaco in a nutshell.Easily a 10/10 if not more.
