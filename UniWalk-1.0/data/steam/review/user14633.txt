They've ruined the game.
Great
One of the best games I have ever played. I love to go back and punch leland in the face all the time. Im sad that there isnt many games like this that are this good.
Best game ever
When I saw people playing this it looked extremely fun but now that I have it, it doesent seem very fun at all to me. During the 1.5 hours I spent playing this I had some fun but it got boring after awhile. For about half of the time I spent playing this game I was gettng gltched out it in ways that didnt make sense (ex: I was trying to swim and I started spinning around over and over for no reason). Maybe it's because im a boring person or its becuase this game is extremely crappy and stupid, but I don't like it.
This game is amazingly beautiful and has an immense and dramatic story. I strongly reccomend this game to anyone that has a pc. each episode of Life is Strange is about maybe 2-6 hours depending on whether or not you rewind alot and want to get all of the optional photos. I don-'t want to reveal anything to anyone who hasn-'t played it or watched it because it may ruin it for them but, I will say that there is so many different choices that it makes it seem that the there is tons of different endings and kinda seems like -'Heavy Rain-.
Spore is the best Life Simulation game I have ever played and i highly recomenned Spore to people who haven't played it. :)
it is very fun but it costs too much money for everything but i dought anyone would want to buy every DLC
