Plenty of Risk. Could use more Rain.But seriously, it is a fun game.Pros:- Game handles well (controls feel quite precise)- Has a good art style- Great Soundtrack (which is available on Bandcamp if you fancy buying it)- Plenty of replayability- Nice variety of items and enemies- All the playable characters are quite different from one another with different play styles and item synergies- Multiplayer (optional)Cons:- Game occasionaly bugs out (although kinda rare)- Multiplayer can be quite buggy (as well as annoying to set up)- Has a bit of a learning curve (you will die quite a bit in beginning)Summary:  Risk of Rain is definitely worth your time. Lots of fun and plenty of things to unlock and find, as well as a great soundtrack that never seems to get old. So for $10, I believe it is definitely a good purchase. Or you could just wait for it to go on sale (that would make it an even better purchase).
