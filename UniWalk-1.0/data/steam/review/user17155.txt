Ahhh..This gem, 2007 and we-'re STILL here playing this game?! So many other games have been released but cannot quench our thirst for..Wh- You mea- Hats... Let-'s push that aside for a momment and see why we-'re REALLY (Still) here..The Updates..Some of the mose game-changing updates have been Mann v Machine, Love and War and.. The CS:GO upda- Wait..Hold on.. I mean the Gun Mettle updates.. :/ Anyways.. Do I recommend this game? We-'ll get to that later, hush down and listen up! The reason these updates were put here is due to the fact that they added something -new- to the game, and no not the cosmetics nor taunts, I mean gamemodes such as MvM fight against waves of bomb-carring robots using upgrades! (sounds fun doesn-'t it?) As the L&W update didn-'t add anything -new- gamemode wise it was one of the biggest TF2 updates *Cough* Bread weapons *Cough* and finally the CS:G- The Gun Mettle..This is where Vavle went a little..downhill on the updates..but, this was a big update adding new maps and also contracts and weapon skins also an inspect button, not to forget the weapon pickups  as well..(CS:GO, Right??) to wrap up this (Horrible) review, Do I recommend this game? YES, Y..You don-'t have this game?! What are you doing?! What rock have you been living und- The reason I recommend this is due to the updates, make you have a reason to come back to the game and stops it from having boring and repettetive gameplay also the Custom gamemodes such as, Dodgeball, Prop Hunt, Hidden, Saxton Hale, Death Run any many more! Plus if that wasn-'t enough, there-'s also user created maps for anyone (Most of the time atleast..) to play on! Well, we-'ve hit the end of this (Horrible) review, hope you enjoyed! (No-one will have made it this far :D)
