I'm absolutely amazed by this game. I used to enjoy watching people play it (slyfoxhound did a playthrough ages ago)  more than I actually enjoyed playing it personally. It was just one of those games back then. However! The new updates and constant fine tuning has turned this game into one that still grabs my attention even after i've finished it. The replayabiltiy with expert mode/self challenges (only yoyo run is awesome) makes this game an absolute STEAL for 10 bucks. Buy it now!!! #noregrets
Very skillful and realistic, improves aim better than any shooter I have ever played. Fun but infuriting at times 9/10
