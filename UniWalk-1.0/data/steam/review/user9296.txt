Lots of reviews talking about how bad this game is... I too just spent a whole single dollar on this game and therefore my opinion about it matters as well.Is it a great game? No.Did I expect a great game? Not with that price tagDo I regret spending that dollar on this game? No way, this was the best dollar I've spent in a long timeProbably because I went into it not expecting much and was rewarded with a fun as hell romp with guns, dinos and zombies. Maybe it needs a warning to stop the tryhards expecting the next Call of Duty. This game is fun, pure and simple (even if the emphasis is on simple) and if the fun police have a problem with that then so be it.
