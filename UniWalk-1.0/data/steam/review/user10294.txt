A challenging puzzle game that improves a skill which can be used IRL. The game runs flawlessly even on an underpowered laptop. Appropriate difficulty and learning curve. Visuals are simple and endearing. Never frustrating and the euphoria of completing puzzles is very present. I thouroghly recommend this game because of the low price point and manages to teach you more about the nature of software development then most paid tutorials and sometimes even classes.
