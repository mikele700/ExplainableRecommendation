Do you want a pay to win game that has ♥♥♥♥ gameplay and is totally unrealistic? This is the game for you!You want to play as the Russian faction? Youre an idiot! :D Shooting a sniper costs you more than spawning in a plane. Heres a list of problems it has, You have no freedom. Its unbalanced. Its pay to win. Game Devs dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about what you want. When the game devs give out an update, it ruins everything. it takes aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaages to earn up a single un customized weapon. This game is a major ♥♥♥♥ you to the World War genre.
It used to be good, back when I could log in. Dont buy it, their support pages dont even work.
