I...don't think that I can explain this game without doing anything spoiler-y but let's get the basics down: you are Stanley, Worker 427, puppet or whatever you call him and one day his computer stops sending orders to him and every one is gone.That's all I want to give you in terms of story because talking any further would be a waste of time, you just have to play it. I also won't talk about gameplay because there isn't any at all. It's worth whatever it costs and you should totally play it.The Reviewer gave The Stanley Parable a 10/10.
