Players Online : 2Who were those players? Me and my Friend.
Well, As much as this game is pretty 50/50 for me, I am gonna give it a positive, It is an enjoyable time killer with plenty of powers and such to use, The thing I do not like about the game, It was pretty complicated to get down.Everything aside if you got 6 Bucks and are looking for a good waste of time, I suggest you pick this game up.
I highly HIGHLY enjoy Portal, Only because myself, I love me a good puzzle!Wanna do some Puzzles with a friend? Portal 2 is your game.I really can't say anything bad about this game, I am overwhelmed with good things but I can't say one, There are to many to just say a couple!
Don't get me wrong, This game is fun as hell. But if you are new to the game don't even bother playing, You are just going to get wrecked by older players it's impossible to do anything without getting yelled at by other players. This game is not worth the time I put into it.
One of my Favorite games!
Really fun 8-bit game! Fasted Paced and all!
Looking for a good 2-D Side Scroller Game? This is your game!Only bad thing I have to say about this game is it's hard to pick up, Building my Ship, Creating my Character and Trying to fight other Pirates was pretty confusing to me at first, But once you get it all down, It's one hell of an Adventure!
All I have to say is This Game, This game is beyond fun, With the enjoyment of Parkour, Assassinating your Targets, Or just straight up getting into a fist fight. This game was very worth the buy and I can't wait to see what else this game brings!The Open World Parkour Sandbox do whatever you please is just so much fun and so much fits into my taste of games.Looking for a good Sandbox? Pick up Overgrowth, You will not be Disappointed!
