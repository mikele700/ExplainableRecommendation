This game is so damn good I do recommend the Gold Upgrade ifyou are looking for a darker or a little sleeker UIand extra character customizationbut the darker UI is a bit hard to get used to and hard to see at night in game but i also recommend Nelson to make creating servers more easier for the people and it might be good to add a little texture to the envirnonmentand the items but overall this is a very good game if it's just to pass time,just bored or just pain playing.
Best FPS on steam (thats my opinion) Positive Sides: -Hat Simulator -Money Wasting Simulator -Time Wasting Simulator - ♥♥♥♥♥  Ducks -etc. Negative Sides: -Kids about 3 to 10 Years old 
This game is worth throwing your money at the screen just to give you the feels 11/10
Has very great features but needs a bit of bug fixes :3 ☼                                                                                                                                                                        ☼    ☼                                                                                           ☼   ☼
