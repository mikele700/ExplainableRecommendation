i'd forgotten how much i enjoyed this game! I had it originally on PS3 and picked it up recently on PC with the steam sale including all the DLC and i throughly enjoyed it. the motion captor work gone into the facial expression at that time was amazing and I am yet to find a modernised police/detective game I enjoy as much as i do with L.A Noire. giving the graphics a bit of leeway given the original DX9 that it launched wih i still find the game as enjoyable as when i played through the game in 2011. throughly recommend even in todays standards from a gameplay and story point of view.
I really, really wanted to like this game. Let-'s be honest it looks amazing. but after playing through the family matters DLC (as it was a prequel to asylum), which I found to have had no performance issues, to playing 30-45 minutes of the main story the issues that plagued the game before the so called -relaunch- are still present. I was thinking my system (16GB ram, GTX 980TI) would have been enough to at least play at the locked 30 FPS (yes i know but i just really wanted to play through the game). Unfortunately this was not enough and i was faced with hard crash after hard crash, memory leak after memory leak. What a poor closure to the batman Arkham series and to be honest this will be my last WB title i dare to consider buying.
