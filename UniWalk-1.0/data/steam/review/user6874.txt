personally, i really liked the artstyle and plot, the game mechanics and stealth where also very good, i love this game and i have played (steam says) about 155 hours, i have finished the game in low chaos and high chaos, i really recomend to play this game, killing everyone berserker mode or sneaking trought all the game is preatty sweet, the only thing i disliked is the hiding of the runes, the 5 - 6 times i have finished the game i have never founded all the runes and i miss like 3 or 4 magical upgrades with runes.Really recomended
