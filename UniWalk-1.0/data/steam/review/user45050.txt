Grand Theft Auto V is a fun game. A great game. I would recommend anyones this game. But Take-Two and to some extent Rockstar have been shutting down third party online servers, just so people play on theirs and buy in-game cash using real money. This is a tactic I do not support, and as a result I would recommend people buy this game. If you want to pirate go ahead, don't support this shady tactics
buy it
