It-'s not lying when it say-'s -Not optimised- ♥♥♥♥ i can-'t get past the play button at the main menu.10/10 would crash again
Great game, has great combat and an interesting storyline...But the Boss battles are the biggest peices of ♥♥♥♥ that are designed to make you want to hit everything around you. You'll have fun trying to time attacks perfectly to get throught the chapters but you'll just want to quit the game as soon as you have to fight some douch bag boss or 2 bosses at once.8/10
It-'s pretty good/fun how it is right now You can select 2 different people (so far) for each role on your ship eg. Enigneer, Pilot and Captain.You don-'t actually play as them and all that but you do hear them talking alot and telling you when you-'re ready to jump.Things I would like to see in the future;Naming your ships so it feels more personal and you feel like you-'re your own unique flagship when everyone on your team is also a flagship.Increase flagship speed, a few times now i-'ve joined a match, started to speed up and try to get into the zone where my team is and then the game ends because my team lost (again) It-'s not a super large problem but if it-'s just 3 minutes then I lose, I atleast want to spend that time getting into the combat and not trying to slowly fly into combat...ALSO I really hope they manage to increase the speed in when you -log on- and search for servers because so far it takes alooooooooong time and i just want to get into the game so plz Dev-'s work on that.Overall great game an I really hope it improves in the future.
