An amazing game, I highly recommend you play it, Ignore the -Mixed- Reviews, I really recommend this game mostly because of the art and peacefulness, but keep this is mind: there isn-'t really anybody on multiplayer, just play singleplayer, it-'s a lot easier. Anyways, I really like how this game looks like it-'s a bad game at first, then it becomes a great game, I know the buildings in the backround look ♥♥♥♥ when you spawn, but hey, at least this game is good.EDIT: Misspelled Singleplayer
this makes my hand fall off
but wait, who is my daddy?!?!?!?11/10 would crash my computer again
♥♥♥♥ing amazing
