Very nice shooter game.
Free survival game. It's fun every now and then but get's boring after a while. It's a bit complex at the start so I recommend watching tutorials. Once you get the hang of it, it's prety fun.
Really fun game, if your interested in weaponary,warfare,strategy and tactics this is the game.
PRetty good game. However, now that other games like cs:go and dota are around TF2 isnt really the best option around.
