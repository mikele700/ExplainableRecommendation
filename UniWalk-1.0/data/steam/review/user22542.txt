So I was looting this house out in the country, I notice a familiar item on top of a book shelf, oh its Wolf-'s mask from Payday 2. Being the massive Payday 2 fan than I am I go to pick it up, as soon as I pick up the mask I see in the bottom left corner -My leg hurts- open up my inventory, oh I have a chipped leg thats a bit weird, but I also notice my vision blurring my leg is now fractured, (mind you I have not moved one inch while this has happened) I begin to panic because im geared to the ♥♥♥♥ing teeth and I dont want to die yet I have so much to live for I proceed to throw the mask on the ground but it was too late, my vision turns to black -you are dead-11/5 Ign WOULD DIE TO A CURSED MASK AGAIN
