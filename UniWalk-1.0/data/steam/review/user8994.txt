if you liked the boxhead games but wish there were only three characters and weird af animations, then this game is for youin addition, when playing it feels like Communism: The Game as everything is shared; money, ammo, weapons.10/10 would buy a shotgun and have it appear in my friend's inventory instead again
The standard Don't Starve experience wrapped up with a well balanced multiplayer.Some things have changed to re-balance the multiplayer and as such you will be surprised and disappointed with a few things. It isnt as bad as you may immediately think, as it is done to keep the feeling of dread that standard single player don't starve was excellent at projecting. More players /= Easier as you all will be competing for resources whether you're playing competitively or not.The multiplayer is done very nicely, as an australian who has been playing with americans (These connections are known to be VERY laggy) i was still able to function, survive effectively and surpass my comrades. There were 'those' moments we all fear from long distance connections but they were few and far between.Being completely honest i'm Very Impressed. it isnt easy to make a single player game into a fully functioning multiplayer version of itself. DS was a 9/10 game for what it was and it's execution, DST makes it a 10/10 because of how well it has translated the single player feel into a co-operative or competitive multiplayer.
A mixture of -halo- -killing floor- and -jurassic park- this game is so unbelievably fun that i can guarantee even the most boring of people 50 hours total game time if not more
