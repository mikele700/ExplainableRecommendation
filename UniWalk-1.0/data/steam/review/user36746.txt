This game has been in my library for quite some time, only when a friend recommended this that I started playing it one bored afternoon. I'm quite open to games but nonetheless I honestly thought this game was going to be boring after browsing through the store page. But seeing that it was recommended to me and that it's also got great reviews, I decided to start it. I didn't know what to expect, the game starts off a bit confusing as it's premise was very new to me, and I'm sure it  will be as well for some of you. What caught my attention and....emotions was the characters, their decisions, motivations and story. It all got me curious and I continued on wanting to learn more as I also got attached to them, some scenes are very heartwarming and sweet and others are innocent and depressing. The way the story is laid out in terms of memory links creates a very interesting and strong medium that makes it very easy to relate and observe the characters from. The game was never frustrating and you'll definitely find yourself pausing occasionally, if you're like me that enjoys a good soundtrack whilst revering the scenes and characters.This is certaintly a great game, if you are looking for a great story, short game with a great soundtrack, I'll also highly recommend this to you.
