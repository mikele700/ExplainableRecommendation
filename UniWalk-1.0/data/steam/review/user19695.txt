Actual Words by me:Yes! I actually did it! oh......wait...♥♥♥♥....WHO THE ♥♥♥♥ PUT A TRAP THERE?!?! PEAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can't even get to the first boss just because of a bug...I highly don't reccomend this game..Thanks for stealing 1 hour of my life and my well-begged 20 dollars.
As much as I would like to recommend this game I can't, Here is why:The graphics are cool 7/10Story is'nt that good in my opinion not sure 'bout you guys 5/10Controls and combos are cewl 8/10The fighting and aiming system is sh*t I mean when I try to kill a bad guy using my kick ♥♥♥ magic powers I end up smashing pots and turning into Link (Those who play The Legend of Zelda series will get the joke)So I rate the fighting and aiming system 3/10Overall score: Do the maths yourself........just kiddingscore of around 55%
Smashed my keyboard......Twice
I could walk through benches. 10/10
Unnotplayable
