Yes yes anyone who knows a bit about the game will scream -ITS LIKE MINECRAFT BUT IN SPACE-. But... in fact this game has more to offer than the stagnant devs at mojang could offer... this game could be many things. It can be more than it is... It has so much well laid foundation including great servers and community to give this game status. System requirments are easy to meet with optimizations already rolling out im able to get 40fps on a samsung ativ 4 ultrabook..... Would 9/11 bang the devs :P
