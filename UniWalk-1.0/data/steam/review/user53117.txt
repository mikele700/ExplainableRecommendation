Absolutely love the game!Dont spend much time on FPS' now that they are very similar but this is a breath of fresh air!Though i have had a few minor problems with getting stuck on inatimate objects along with parts of the story not starting in which both i need to reset to checkpoint.Although for a game with no multiplayer i had hoped the campaign would be alot longer than it was & i feel let down by the ending...Still a great game.
One of the best games ive played, Doesnt take you 12 hours to finish & there is so much to do!
