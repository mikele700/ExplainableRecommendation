Great Game as I said in the Original Bioshock. I love the new hacking system & the ranged hacking mechanics. This game was as interesting as the first. Must Buy/Play. Although I kept crashing at some places, all I had to do was change the settings to lowest :P. Still got creeped out. 11/10
Guys we made it!!!!! BOOBS ARE FULLY ROUND!!!!11/10
Bioshock Infinite is a new storyline to the Bioshock series. It's great and interesting. It's a MUST buy.11/10p.s I LOVE THE BIOSHOCK SERIES SO I MAY BE BIASED...
Crysis is a sci-fi fps game. It's pretty good but my only complaint(s) are that this game has to many bugs/glitches ( TAC gun not locking eg.) It is also extremely irritating of how insanely impossible some parts are in hard mode.Ea has once again released an unstable but good game.7/10
Great Game. Great Graphics.For the price I paid, Definitely Worth it.Got scared multiple times 11/10
I'm officially addicted. If anyone is bored, This game will fustrate you in Insane mode. Have fun playing is very addicting game :)This game reminds me of DDR but its on a keyboard :)
