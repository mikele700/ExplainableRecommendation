Battleblock theatre is such an awesome game to play, especially in the co-op setting. It is competitive, fun platformer that is very addicting. Not only that, but u can also customize your character with different heads and weapons. This adds a very nice touch to the game. i would definetely recommend this game to anyone who likes platformers.
