Ok lets keep this short.So. Your either having fun reking otherwise your dying and raging, or losing works aswell.However you can always spray and pray and maybe... just maybe GabeN will answer your prayers and give you gets teh killz. (MAYBE) Or just blame the lag :P that happens too. Dont feel bad. Trust me.... It can happen.
Three ways to enjoy this game1. Solo it in normal to very hard 2. Play with a group of friends in Very hard to Death wish3. Always go loud (Play Vlad or Bain)BONUS! :D  If you like to stealth play the Elephant or Shadow raid (You must complete the following 3 steps to get the skills and perks you want)TIPs: Just keep shooting them! (AND NOT THE CIVILIANS!!!!) >:/
