I got this game in the steam sale. Bought it for all my friends. No one did the tutorial and everyone jumped straight into a Free for All PvP. Discovered the strategic missile, nuked everyone before any of us knew how to counter it.10/10
HI FRIENDS, YOU HAVE TO CHECK OUT SUPERHOT, IT'S THE MOST INNOVATIVE SHOOTER I'VE PLAYED IN YEARS
This game, after buying the 2 pack and giving the other to my best friend and playing it for 15 mins, is seriously amazing. Awesome art, music and great, great gameplay. I strongly recommend it as the gameplay provides for awesome either 30 second fights or eternal fights. The amount of sneaky, freind ship ruining tricks just makes it an unforgetable experience. 11/10 - would pay $30 for
