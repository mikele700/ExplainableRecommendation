Really miss virtual sailer, which wasn't VR but was the best sailing game out there.I jumped in to have a look at VR Regatta and like the other reviews,  I know it has great potential.If this game goes MP, I'm in. Everything worked nice. A bit tiring on the steering as for a tight turn, you had to move the stick a metre but I'm sure that will all change.I got a little sea sick, but nothing I couldn't handle. Funny thing is, I stay on my boat 3 days a fortnight and never get sea sick but some VR games just get to me.Comfort rating would be a 6 out of 10. Great work. Stick with it.
Love what they are doing with this game. The movements are slow enough that you don't get motion sickness but still get to pilot the time machine like a sub.The graphics are pretty and feel realistic.A controller is the best option for an emmersive feel. I use the Xbox wireless.I will buy this game as it looks like it has a full story mission to follow.You play sitting down so very comfortable for long sittings.Demo is around 5 minutes long.Ai reminds me a bit of portal. Hope thay keep it light and funny.
