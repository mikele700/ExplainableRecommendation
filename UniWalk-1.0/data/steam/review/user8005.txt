I was so put off from buying this game after reading every review i could find and finally i did buy it for the xbox and played through it twice and now ive bought it again on steam and wow oh wow what a game, it isnt my favourate RE game but ♥♥♥♥ it is fun and had so really enjoyable moments and great boss fights. I can see why people are so upset with this game i feel they just tried to add to much and try to many different things at once and in the end was to over the top for a RE game but once you can overlook certain aspects about the game it will offer you ALOT of fun and enjoyment. and one last note aobut the QTE's they are no where near as bad as i thoguht they were going to be, the only time they ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off was when a zombie gets to close to you and instantly throws you into a QTE that ♥♥♥♥ pissed me off ALOT
Such a fantastic final fantasy game, great port, 0 issues throughout the interity of the game, controls are fine and gameplay is really enjoyable along with the story and job system,Easily 4.5/5
My favourate RE game without a doubt, Offers a fantastic campaginand offers a fantastic post game mode being raid mode that will get you lost in it for HOURS, with some fantastic characters to play (Leon,Hunk,Jill,Claire) to name somethe only issues with this game is that they rushed it which is pretty evident when you start playing campaign mode, alot of audio issues, graphics and visual issues, and diaglog issues. But this dosent carry off into raid mode which is fantastic. 8/10
