like most people i love the bioshock franchise but this isnt a remaster all it is the next leavel in grafic setting eg very high its still bioshock buts as others have said old bugs havent being fixed and new ones added an example of this is i can not run the game in fullscrean with out seeing a black screan also  my screan reasoltion choice are numbered the game will be fun once bugs are fixed but as a remaster all it will ever be is the normal bioshock on a slightly higher graphics setting
the game has been patch so it dose run beeter which is great the game is very rust/dayz like but with dinos
great mod 10/10
