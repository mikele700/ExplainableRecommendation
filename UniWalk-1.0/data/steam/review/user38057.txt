This game is awesome. Wake up to it on a lazy Sunday morning, brilliant stuff.
Not a bad little city builder. Give it a crack, but will need a few hours to finish.
Seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun. Lots of room for improvement though...
I really like the game, but I couldn’t find the stupid cake.
This game is seriously awesome. Quick fix skirmish fun that's gonna keep me coming back for ages! For $6, get it! But before playing it, besure to look up a tutorial on youtube, as to help ease you into the game better. Two thumbs up!
Not too sure about this game. It wants to be good, but it's just missing the mark in many key areas.
Really enjoying the style of this game! Nice all round tower defence shooter. Grab it, and finish it. :P
SO MUCH PUZZLE GOODNESS. CAPS DOES NOT DO THIS GAME JUSTICE!
