Risk of Rain is a beautifuly made game with 12 unique classes that all have different play styles.Along with many secrets this is also a completionist's game as there are many items, monster logs and achievementsWould HIGHLY recommend those who enjoyed the Binding of Isaac (also rebirth) and/or shooting/platformer games with perma-death and rogue-like elements.But this is just my opinion... Don't let me be the determinating factor in your love/hate for this game.
Don-'t Starve is already a fun game with many intricate game mechanics, so Klei creating a multiplayer version was a brilliant idea. If you have -Not Starved- before in single player imgaine trying to do that while supporting friends at the same time. Another good feature about multiplayer is that multiple characters means mulitple bonuses e.g. Wilson for beard, Wolfgang for damage, Willow for..well..fire. Also the workshop is also included and provides some fun different characters/items to play with. Regarding dying when someone (inevitabley) dies they will become a ghost, this ghost will lower players sanity until revived into a player again using methods such as; touch stone, life giving amulet, meat effigy and after this occurs the player will have less maxium health, but this maxium health can be restored with a booster shoot (which isn-'t too hard, but not easy to make). Overall this is a high amount of fun espically over skype with friends but it also has a few bugs (early access).So in shortRating: 9.5/10 Would Not Starve Together Again
