I used to love this game it was a true shooter but now I cant stand to play this game for even so much as a single match, Im not a fan of the jump and shoot the ground tactic about 98% of every loadout player does, taking two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t rocket launchers and the jumpboots and this game is a living hell. I usually equip myself with two rifles or a combination of  a rifle and pulse, joining any game with your generous choice of weapons will reward you with at least 4 people spamming the grounds with there proximity, super slow, three round burst, hexbarrel rocket launcher. It doesnt matter if he misses (somehow) he will be reloaded in about two seconds and ready to bombard you again. Attemping to kill them with an assault rifle is impossible with Mr. Barrel Roll, super jump, rocket boots man. Until I see either a nerf to launchers or a buff to all else, that makes everyone think about even having a launcher. If that lucky person you find isnt constantly spamming rockets, hes probually got a lv.3+ pyro rapid fire pulse weapon thats fire damage does more then any other rocket launcher could ever do.
