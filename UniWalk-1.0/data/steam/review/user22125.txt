Okay, I like this game. The developers have obviously put a lot of work and effort into it. Its not the horror game they promised. I havent been truly scared yet BUT! Thats not a bad thing. I once got into a battle with six mutants, put the song Light Up The Night by The Protomen on, and had one of the best melee combat experiences in any game ive ever played. I like this combat better than Skyrim's, Assassin Creed's and some of Chivalry's. The graphics are the BEST ive ever seen in any indie game. The lighting is superb and the flora and fauna rival a tripple-A game's quality.Now, I must say I am extremely disappointed by the fact that there is no save option yet, so i'm mainly looking for cannibals to fight, rather than building a base. The sound design could be better. I think having war cries in battle of mindless chattering sounds coming from dormant cannibals would make the game  much more immersive. I probably wont play this game until a save option is implemented. But know this, Endnight Games, you have achieved great things with this game. Do not buy if you dont want to deal with bugs or having no save features. Wait for the full release of beta.8/10
Unbalanced as ♥♥♥♥ at the moment. A point blank Nova does 42 damge in 2 hits, while a Famas does 91 in 1 hit, in the ♥♥♥♥ing knee. Dont buy this piece of crap until its fixed. I wish i could go back to the golden days of Global Offensive, before all this update ♥♥♥♥.
