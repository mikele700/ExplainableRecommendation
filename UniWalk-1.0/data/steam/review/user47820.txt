-Don't mind my hours spent, I've clocked crapton of hours on Xbox 360.-Review on SP only.Dead Island is no stranger to the zombie mania. It's a definite win for avid zombie fans and is a reminiscence for the good old times. Dead Island has an array of features not only the brain dead zombies per se but also weapon crafting, somewhat open-world experience and at times, mowing down horde of zombies with a rusty car. It's a great game indeed and deserve the accolade as TMoZG. [As if that acronym exist] On the other hand, unlike the console platform, the PC platform does have it's flaws. In hindsight, the game does stutters due to poor optimization even with a GTX 760. But then again, that's about it. Oh, totally not for the weak-hearted. Compared to Dead Island Riptide, this stands out. Nothing beats the original that's for sure. Having said all of these, Dead Island does pumped me up for Dying light and Dead Island 2 as a starter kit.
Damn son. This game is in its own league... Set in a post apocalyptic Russia, infested with zombies and massively multiplayer what more can you ask for? Map is huge and you decide how you survive it, make friends or foes. Bandits or heroes. Different arrays of weapons,supplies,clothing and equipment at every nook and cranny of the map. Waiting to be discovered by you. You decide.
Super hard and frustrating game that-'s for sure. Yet it-'s super addictive, accompanied with an epic soundtrack. Although I can-'t stand -BEGIN... GAME OVER- ringing in my ears every second, it-'s worth a try that-'s for sure. A simple, arcade-style game worth every penny!
