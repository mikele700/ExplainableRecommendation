Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww Man................ Again, another failed sound game. But seriously, when are you guys EVER going to get a patch out to fix the sound bug. As soon as I bought this game because it looked pretty good, it runs perfect on my computer but only 1 problem. There is no sound. Even on the desktop there's no sound while running Sniper: Ghost warrior 2. I have searched the net EVERYWHERE for a solution, but none of them worked. I even heard some had troubles with the first one. I got bored of the first mission straight away as I couldn't hear ANYTHING. Nothing, Not even during the cutscene. I hope this will be fixed once I come back from overseas in a few weeks :)
