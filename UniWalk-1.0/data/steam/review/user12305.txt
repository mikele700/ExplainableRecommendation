LEGO® Worlds 8.5/10Good thingsI rode a pig as a police officer (brothers in arms)An actual LEGO® game with Lego terrainPlenty of things to do in the enviroment Plenty of vehicles and charactersBad thingsCan't find controller supportOkay options No Batman!This game has plenty of content, but since it still is in early access it doesn't have enough. I would still buy this since once it comes out of early access it will still stay the same price. I would give this a 8.5 because it has plenty of content and there is so many things to do.
what to do with this game: download mods
