Great game, always good fun and you get 5 TF2 items from it (Lugermorph - Pistol, Dangeresque Too? - Demoman Misc, Iron Curtain - Heavy Minigun, Enthusiast's Timepiece - Spy Invis Watch and Licence to Maim - All class misc).If you love poker why wouldn't you play this.
Great game, always tonnes of fun and kinda teaches you to take care of pets, if you like popcap games this is definitely one you should try
Unarguably the best free to play game in history, if you don't have it, GET IT!!!!IT'S ♥♥♥♥EN GOOD!!!
A hugely popular sequel to Left 4 Dead, a must play!
