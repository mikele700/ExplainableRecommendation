Best airport shootout simulator 10/1-
My god, I haven't played this game in a while, but it's so incredibly underplayed. Worth every bit of money you put in it.
( ͡◕ ͜ʖ ͡◕)
Pretty fun especially with a friend, however, the map tends to feel the same after while.
Great Co-Op and Single player, Fun lore, Amazing maps, Weapons well balanced. 9/10
This game is god awful. Do NOT play this. When you first log in you have you create an account like most Free To Plays. Once you finally get past the log in screen you have to deal with the terrible automated resoultion which by the way when you first launch the game you can't change because of the f**king useless tutorial, so if you have an adverage monitor like me you can't see the full screen until you manage to click away the tutorials, get into the menu and change the resoultion. Whats even more annoying is that you can't change the aspect ratio. Personally I play games at 4:3 because it reduces lag and feels like it reduces input lag. Whats even more terrible is that once you get into the game, even with maxed out sensitivity its still horribly low so its incredibly hard to aim. I wasn't able to get into a proper match as apparently there were net works issues. But from what I've managed to strangle out of this game the gameplay seems to be s**t. 3/10 For what I managed to play.
Good game
