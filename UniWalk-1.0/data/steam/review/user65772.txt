Terraria is a shockingly awesome game, similiar to Minecraft, it has multiple worlds, but it allows you to name your character, it gives you a sense of character progression, for said player to find his/her origins, to find why he has been dropped on this island world, Minecraft has that also you say? well Terraria injects steroids into that aspect, the possiblities in this game is endless, it gives a RPG feel, allowing you to slay monsters for currency and trade said currency for goods from various merchants.Many players of Minecraft that don't understand what Terraria is, they say it is a copy of Minecraft, it isn't, it is a delicate game with loads of content as of the 1.3 update, when Terraria is on sale for the holidays, I would recommend it to people that haven't tried this game.
