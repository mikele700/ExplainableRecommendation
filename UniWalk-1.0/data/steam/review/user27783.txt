Seems well optimized and love the Australiana but the driving is bollox, the combat is bollox and the controls are bollox, just playing it at this point to get the torture over and done with.
Pretty fun game, bit rough but easily ignored, specially cause of the GITS factor, but the AUS servers seem to be abandoned, have never got a match since the first week or so, I assume they might just only come on at certain times, but its more likely they just got sick and stopped playing...
I love this game, really I do, but the bugs, the god damn bugs -_-
Fix the ♥♥♥♥ing crossbows, JFC, and on a lighter note, I would appretiate if one of the ping guarded Oceanic servers could be Crownlands please, having 3 Stormlands and only 1 Crownland server thats covered in Chinese players pestering us is annoying and Stormlands is far too big without mounts for me to bother with.
Great concept, graphics are fine, for the price point they're good, but buggy as hell and bad resolution support, I don't mind if its a small cheap game it seemed fun enough for the time being but when the blueprints showing you unlocked your first gun blocks the entire screen and won't go away then the pause screen when you go to exit also blocks your view so you can't play the game you know ♥♥♥♥♥ gone wrong.
The graphical options are rather limiting but the game itself is glorious, so glad I bought it. Would be good to have a button to stop the cue moving left or right for more accurate shots but maybe I just missed that one, will check options later and update if so.
Great game, as good as Broforce, just one problem: On I think it was the third level theres a rather bad framerate drop, once I passed that stage the next one was as smooth as the rest but on that particular stage everything was a crawl.
Yeeeeeeeeeeeah, this game used to be good fun but now the crew doesn-'t even respond, tutorial says -Press the corresponding keys to select the group your crew are in!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?- but I can-'t find a way to set them on the crew screen and I don-'t think they are assigned a default button cause I-'ve tried all the number  buttons and nothing.
Needs a server browser for when you are in a match like most Source games have and a Filter that actually keeps the settings you put on it like most games that have server browsers, other than that the game is pretty good, a step up from ZPS
Got some real annoying bugs like when I first alt+tab back into it it goes into Steam Community (shift+tab) when i go to run, just recently died cause when I bailed out of my car since it was almost destroyed plowing through a horde, tried to call in backup before getting mauled, but since I pulled up the menu mid-run, it didn-'t work and just kept spamming me with the menu whenever I tried to change direction, the -community/side missions- are repetitive and are almost too frequent to do the main missions with unless you ignore it and let the people get unhappy since they aren-'t getting help/are getting lost, also I-'ve had a few zombies while jumping fences land inside the walls of buildings that they were previously outside and cars flip from pebbles on the road, usually right beside a horde. Also the map system is horrid by todays standard, but maybe I-'m just being a wuss expecting it to actually show a route to where I put a waypoint but it saves having to keep checking the map which doesn-'t pause the game.Other than that the engine is pretty good (apart from previous stated bugs/glitches that have occured) the fact that you can change out to almost any character to keep your health up (drugs for keeping it up in the field) and designate where and what buildings you want in your base aswell as WHERE the base is, and set up outposts. Driving is rather easy but I hate hatchbacks, too weak. Seems like a step up from Project Zomboid, but when ProjZomb gets things like survivors and hopefully a better server browsing system the tables might turn.
