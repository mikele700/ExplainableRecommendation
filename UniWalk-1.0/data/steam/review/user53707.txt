What can i say i love the long dark. I wanted a break from all those zombies and odd mutations in my games and i found this, This game is amazing to look at and a whole heap of fun at the same time on my first run i was minding my own buisness when i found a big red tower i walked up the mountain and up the stairs while i was there i started a fire but i was low on food so i went out to find some but just my luck a blizzard had swept in. so i warmed up grabbed the rifle on the wall and went out into the blizzard it was then i saw my first wolf just sitting their in the middle of the frozen lake i slowly aproached it and instantly and howl came out of the wolf and thats when i started running.10/10
