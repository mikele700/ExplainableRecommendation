8.7/10, utter garbage
These controls are horrible, i stopped playing after 15 minutes, couldn't handle it.
Oh my God
The ♥♥♥♥ is this game. 10/10
♥♥♥♥ing runs at 30FPS and 10FPS in cities on lowest settings and I have a god damn GTX 970, 8GB RAM and an I5-3570K.Game itself it okay aside from the horrible optimization.
Buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game, it is a must have. I don't even have to explain, the game itself is great and the amount of modding makes it millions of times better.
eh, its ok11/10
