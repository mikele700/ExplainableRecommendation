After, playing hours and hours of the -'old-' -Ace of Spades- (see buildandshoot.com), I bought this game with high anticipation and excitement!  Sure, this game is a Minecraft, TF2-inspired FPS combat that feels relatively new in a genre that is completely overrated...it-'s fast-paced combat certainly sets it away from a crowded FPS genre, and its Zombie mode is surprisingly the best mode in terms of balance and fun.  Another positive is that it offers map editing and the ability to share custom maps.Sadly, each of Ace of Spades-' four classes certainly have their pros and cons, which significantly imbalance the game depending on gamemode.  For example, the Rocketeer jetpacks across the map with an SMG in Capture the Flag which seems unforgivably lopsided.  Furthermore, the -'Minecraft-' building aspect seems untouched and is hardly used which is also hampered by a bugged reticule...
Awesome game!  To me, Loadout is an EXTREMELY customisable version of tf2 with a bit more cartoon blood just like Borderlands 2.  The range of weapon and character customisation isenormous and the fact all weapon customisation options are available to all people is AMAZING.  Gameplay is fun and very fast-paced making for quick and exciting combat that is excellent esoecially for casual gamers.  Only down sides are that character customisation costs (unless you get items through daily prize) and sadly it is difficult at times to find an active match of humans vs. humans.  Apart from these, Loadout is a fantastic game many of you should try.7.5/10 - Very Good
