Brilliant and fantastic and then brilliant some more.If you can get over the heroine's accent.
Do yourself a favour and buy this game immediately
It's a First Person Cyberpunk Shooter with robots, what's not to love?The story is a little predictable, but the game is solid and has excellent flow.
Third person, story-based, thrilling and completely enthralling. A fantatic work of art that clearly defined a tone and stuck to it for the duration. The core mechanics did not become tedious as I'd originally assumed. The game is paced expertly and culminates in a fantastic ending that kept me thinking.
Thrilling, Intense and gripping beyond belief. TWD:S2 creates an atmosphere I never would have believed capable of a video game. Get it now and eagerly await the release of future episodes!
A quirky and fun puzzler that's sure to entertain! Perfect for a rainy afternoon when you don't know what to play.
I absolutely adore this game.Not just a generic, brown shooter - SO much more.Just trust me on this one.
It's surprisingly well done in the style of the comic series with genuine emotion, fantasic writing and a main character I didn't hate, because it was me.
Fictional characters more believable than real people and a story that drags on just the right amount.
