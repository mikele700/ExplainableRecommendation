game can be fun. casual match can go for a matter of minutes so u shouldnt have trouble finding a chance to enjoy a quick round.negatives? - people tend to abuse the voting option and kick people from servers alot. can also be a bunch of negative things said to players in chat and on mic by other players.positives? -  can be fun and addictive trying to beat the other team, the more people playing in the server the more fun it is, especially when the servers filled with friendly respectful players.
