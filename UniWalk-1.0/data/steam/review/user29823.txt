Guys do not get this game, this game is literaly for 5 year olds because how simple this game actually is and how boring it is so if you were bored to hell and want something to do I suggest watching paint dry or banging your head agaisnt the wall for a few hours. They are much better than playing this game, trust me I have been there.
Guys if you ever erged for a first person shooter that is truley addicting, or urged for a bit more to indepth game play of first person shooters? Well than this game is for you mixing elements of great stratergising team work and the maddness of a shooter on a global scale. Guys I honestly would recommend this game because it just looks stunniny has amazing gameplay.
