Fun Game. I Feel It Handles Lag Better Than Tf2. TF2 Is Still A Great Game Though.
I Had Fun Playing it while i was not playing tf2 (and l4d2) But Going Online Is Too Hard I get owned. Lol[Edit] Now I have gotten a bit better, fun to play with people, I only run into dickbags every 5 matches.
Great Game I Have A Tone Of Fun Playing This :) (Like TF2 Fun)
Great For Making Movies But Hard To Learn How To LOL
i think it is the best
