Some think that Terraria is the -2D Version of MInecraft-.In a way that may be true but the game has a lot more to it than just being 2D. There is a lot more adventure in Terraria although the map is limited. With the different mobs scattered throughout the biomes, it wil be a lot more challenging.BOSSES-There are many bosses that you can fight. As you become better at playing, the bosses also get harder to make it a continuous challenge.ITEMS-Items!!...That one of the greatest things about this game. There are so many Items! You can make so many things. So many Weapons with different attributes and you can choose which ones you want to fight with depending on your preference of combat.BLOCKS-If you-'re a builder, there-'s a variety of blocks and the blacks can also change their shape too. You can beuild a lot of  things, anything you want to.Overall, I believe that Terraria is a cool game to play. The gaming hours can total over few hundred hours. Consider checking it out.ThanksCHAMON LEE
