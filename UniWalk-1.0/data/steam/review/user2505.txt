If I could give this game 0/10 stars I would, hell if I could rate this game as the worst game ever created I would. First of all, let me start off by saying that Black Ops 3 is a Triple A title meaning that it has a huge corporate funding behind it. Obviously we-'d think that the game would at least be half decent with such a large budget and skilled staff behind its creation. Well, no. This game feels like it had about 10 million dollars in the graphics department and maybe 10000 dollars in the bugs/glitch avoidance, gameplay, story line, and online matchmaking departments. The game is terribly optimised especially for PC and the reviews it got on every professional gaming website/magazine was 100% f***ing paid for! 9/10 on some websites? B*****it! The worst part about this game is the part that everybody wants, the damn multiplayer. Now this has more issues than anything in the game. When you think about the issues with other multiplayer games you think of  things such as bad servers, ping issues, or just bad ping/lag compensation. Well, this game has all of those and more! If you-'re looking to play a game with more than one of your friends then this is definitely not the game you-'re looking for. Around 90% of the time you try to join someone else-'s lobby with more than one person already in it, it starts a s**t storm of errors for you and your friends. Constant error messages saying -error lobby is full- (even if you-'re the only one in the lobby) and it might as well just say -error go f**k yourself-. Matchmaking also brings along a great new feature called -get screwed over by the same person several times in the span of 10 seconds!-. Now this is a fantastic little thing that COD has added to their online mode and it allows you to be spawn f***ed by the same player over and over again until you just want to Alt + F4. Their respawn system is so insanely broken that sometimes you just spawn in the middle of a bunch of enemies, which sounds great for some people because you can just spray them down but that-'s never the case. Finally this online mode brings a final, new way to be screwed over by anyone you run into because well lets face it, you-'re **t at this game. But hey I don-'t blame you! When you-'re level 1 you-'re constantly being bombarded by a bunch of 4 times prestiged players who have no life or are just really damn good at the game. Honestly, kudos to them for getting such a high level so quickly but at the same time screw you Activision! Starting players can barely start until they-'re around lvl 10 and get a half decent gun with some attachments and by then your KD and Win/Loss ratio is already f***ed beyong repair. So in conclusion, this game is probably one of the worst Triple A title games you will ever purchase and whether the Triple A title is worth $15 or $100 (like this one) this game is definitely not worth it in anyway. The PC optimisation is absolutely terrible with a bombshell of issues from frame lag to being unable to play the damn game until you have at least spent a solid s***ty night or two getting destroyed by fellow players.
A very good game still a bit glitchy in a lot of ways but with some touch ups it could be an amazing multiplayer game experience.
