Very nice casual game.Fun time-killer.'Got a free copy of the game from orlygift.com'
It's Final Fantasy. How could it not be great?Excellent story, beautiful music and the pixels i have ever seen.10/10 Could be better - IGN
Counter-Strike still remains my favourite Multiplayer FPS series. Global Offensive took CSS and added a more up-to-date competitiveness to it. Even though the new Rank system is the worst thing they could have possibly added to Counter Strike in my opinion, you can always go back and play Source or 1.6 if your looking for a more casual experience.8.5/10 ~ Has chickens, molotovs and Dak Dak's but with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mainstream ranking system.
The idea is there, but the quality of the game itself is quite poor.
A great modification for HL2, extremely fun.
Waited outside girls room for 20 hours so i could give her a flower.Stays in there until 3am and goes to bed.9.5/10 Immersive Rejection
