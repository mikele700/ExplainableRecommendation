Play this game. I am serious. It's gorgeous, the sountrack is amazing and the story is so good! Although I am bad at vidya gamez, I cannot help but love my way through this. It was a plesant surprise as I had no idea what to expect going into it, but I have enjoedevery minute of gameplay.Get this. Play this. Love this!
An absolutely visually stunning, exciting game where you can spend hours just wandering around and not feel bored. Lots to do and see, many awesome ways to kill people and wonderful game play. A few bugs here and there, but for being such a huge open world, it can be expected and overlooked as lulz. Buy this, get all the DLC and make your very existence complete.
Tastes like a whole bunch of win and victory. Especially with the General Knoxx DLC. A quality game with a fantastic style, a great sense of humour and hours of entertainment to be had.
